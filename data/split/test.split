another aspect of the pivot involves moving away from the middle east .
but no amount of fancy footwork , whether pivoting or pirouetting , can diminish that region ’s importance .
the middle east will remain a central pillar of world energy for decades to come . whether it ultimately can export more energy than instability is the key question .
unlike east asia , the middle east remains a region in turmoil , the complexity of which defies analytical consensus .
do the region ’s crises stem from the lack of peace with israel ?
this deterrence logic produces a snowball effect .
with russia and the us holding 18,000 of the world ’s current stockpile of 19,000 nuclear weapons , it is proving impossible to persuade any of the other nuclear-armed states to reduce their own ( much smaller ) arsenals until the big two make further drastic cuts to theirs .
china shares russia ’s concerns about us conventional and missile-defense superiority , and is increasing and modernizing its estimated 240-weapon stockpile .
with china taking that course , india – outside the npt but with 100 weapons of its own – feels the need to add to its own arsenal .
and pakistan then becomes even more determined to try to keep ahead of india .
two centuries later that was no longer the case : by the end of the nineteenth century , median living standards in britain and other countries to which the industrial revolution had spread were , for the first time in recorded history , light-years above any neo-malthusian benchmark of subsistence .
the early industrial-era economic accomplishments occurred despite the loss of a substantial proportion of national income to support a corrupt , decadent , and profligate aristocracy .
they occurred despite a tripling of the population , which put extraordinary malthusian pressure on the economy underlying natural resource base , and despite the mobilization of an unprecedented proportion of national income for nearly a century of intensive war against france , a power with three times britain ’s population .
how , exactly , did these accomplishments occur ?
what were the small differences that turned out to matter so much ?
the referendum ’s outcome has had little effect on the wider global landscape , and the impact on eu institutions is just another crisis to be managed , not the existential implosion that london-centric british newspapers imagine .
may is in no hurry to act ; nor is german chancellor angela merkel ( though , facing re-election next year , the increasingly desperate french president françois hollande says that he is ) .
may , who is as tight-lipped as cameron was an open ( if empty ) book , has already created the institutional skeleton of a political strategy .
her government has created a department of international trade , which will be responsible for drawing up trade arrangements with the eu and the rest of the world ( the european commission had previously handled such arrangements ) .
another new department , the so-called brexit ministry , will handle political , judicial , and constitutional negotiations .
venezuela has tried to finance itself with the help of the china development bank , which does not impose the kind of conditionality that imf bashers dislike .
instead , the cdb lends on secret terms , for uses that are undisclosed and corrupt , and with built-in privileges for chinese companies in areas like telecommunications ( huawei ) , appliances ( haier ) , cars ( chery ) , and oil drilling ( ictv ) .
the chinese have not required that venezuela do anything to increase the likelihood that it regains creditworthiness .
they merely demand more oil as collateral .
whatever the imf ’s faults , the cdb is a disgrace .
one television advertisement said it all about the low-rent cynicism of the tea party-driven campaign .
it featured two clips of obama saying , “ i ’ve worked with republican senator dick lugar to pass a law , ” and , “ what i did was reach out to senator dick lugar . ”
the context was not explained , but what obama said in full was this : “ i ’ve worked with republican senator dick lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world ’s deadliest , unguarded weapons , ” and , “ what i did was reach out to senator dick lugar , a republican , to help lock down loose nuclear weapons . ”
with the defeat of lugar , and the simultaneous exit of the last republican moderates , like senator olympia snowe of maine , who were prepared to put national interests ahead of partisanship , the senate is unlikely to produce the 60 votes needed to ratify further us-russia arms-control treaties , should they be negotiated .
moreover , the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty , which would replace a fragile international moratorium , can not come into force without us senate ratification .
perhaps he will be imprisoned for assisting terrorists , but his betrayal generates little resentment .
secure states tend to forget about treason .
insecure states are quicker to sense acts of betrayal .
the soviets , with their fragile legitimacy , always feared betrayal .
they called their crime izmena rodine - betrayal of the motherland - and they married this high moral language to minor transgressions , such as leaving the country illegally .
but there is no comparable protest against the use of antipsychotic drugs , which have similarly been forced on people – and even used to torture prisoners .
and , whereas few people now get ect involuntarily , and in all cases consent is sought , a large and growing number get antipsychotic drugs under false pretences , including children , vulnerable adults , patients with alzheimer ’s , and a host of others whose lives are shortened by treatment , with no effort undertaken to seek their consent .
although ect ’s opponents believe that it causes brain damage , this is difficult to prove .
like antipsychotic drugs , antidepressants , and tranquilizers , ect has an immediate organic effect .
but , while ect rarely , if ever , causes clear clinical evidence of brain damage and has not been shown to do so in animal studies , antipsychotic drugs regularly do , in the form of tardive dyskinesia and other syndromes .
new york – trade negotiators in singapore recently failed to finalize a deal on the long-awaited trans-pacific partnership ; they will soon have another chance to complete what would be the world ’s largest regional free-trade agreement .
but , given serious concerns that the tpp will fail to consider important human-rights implications , that is no cause for celebration .
the tpp talks involve the united states , canada , and ten other pacific rim countries with a combined annual output of around $ 26 trillion , or about 40 % of global gdp .
their economic clout is matched by their ambitions ; the talks go beyond traditional trade issues , which account for only five of the 29 proposed chapters , and consider a wide range of investment and regulatory issues that will affect many millions of people – and not always positively .
whether trade liberalization generally helps or harms the most vulnerable is a complex question .
the exciting thing about open education is that free access is just the beginning .
open education promises to turn the current textbook production pipeline into a vast dynamic knowledge ecosystem that is in a constant state of creation , use , reuse , and improvement .
open education promises to provide children with learning materials tailored to their individual needs , in contrast to today ’s “ off the rack ” materials , together with quicker feedback loops that match learning outcomes more directly with content development and improvement .
and open education promises new approaches to collaborative learning that leverage social interaction among students and teachers worldwide .
late last year in cape town , we joined delegates from around the world to reach a consensus on open education ’s ideals and approaches , and we committed ourselves to them in the cape town open education declaration , which was officially released on january 22 .
what , in his view , are the boundaries for us engagement ?
under what conditions would the us use its capabilities ?
nearly 70 years ago , when george orwell examined the tendency toward ambiguity , he offered the rather simple explanation that “ political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible . ”
in other words , hazy language is necessary to obscure unsavory realities .
massive violence against civilian populations is “ pacification , ” and ethnic cleansing is a “ transfer of population . ”
brussels – to many people in the west , china seems to have gone from a country that “ keeps a cool head and maintains a low profile , ” in deng xiaoping ’s formulation , to one that loves a good international bust-up .
putting an australian mining executive behind bars for ten years , squeezing out google , keeping the european union at bay for an important dialogue , and letting a mid-level official wag his finger at us president barack obama at the copenhagen climate summit is not , after all , the best way to convince partners of your constructive intentions .
nor is it reassuring to recall that china , up to now , has been stubbornly watering down sanctions on iran , investing in major offensive military systems , and pillorying western leaders for irresponsible financial policies and protectionism .
but the point in reciting this litany is not so much to highlight china ’s wayward behavior as it is to demonstrate the dilemma in which the country finds itself : if it behaves like a “ normal ” power , the world will forget the many hundreds of millions of people that it still needs to pull out of poverty .
the chinese leadership seems to be aware of this dilemma and is not , in fact , eager to be dragged into fierce competition with the west or its neighbors .
if this continues , europe will lose its influence in world affairs and gradually become irrelevant .
fortunately , the experience of the 1980s suggests a way forward .
the international situation at the time was no less dangerous than it is today .
yet we succeeded in ameliorating it – not just normalizing relations but ending the cold war confrontation itself .
this was achieved primarily through dialogue .
these factors help to explain why the digital economy has given rise to large firms that have a reduced need for labor .
and , once these firms are established and dominate their chosen market , the new economy allows them to pursue anti-competitive measures that prevent actual and potential rivals from challenging their position .
and , as the economists david autor , david dorn , lawrence f. katz , christina patterson , and john van reenen show , the us industries with the fastest-growing market concentration have also seen the largest drop in labor ’s share of income .
this increased market concentration is widening the gap between the firms that own the robots ( capital ) and the workers whom the robots are replacing ( labor ) .
but confronting it will require us to reinvent antitrust for the digital age .
and whom do we have to thank for all this european progress ?
do we owe it to the wisdom of europe ’s political leaders , particular that of the “ merkozy ” odd couple of merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy ?
unfortunately not : progress resulted almost exclusively from the pressure of the much-maligned financial markets .
just as former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was brought down not by political opponents , but by jittery investors , it was the markets , not european leaders , that opened the door to european fiscal and political union .
that is no cause for celebration .
and if multiple currencies all depreciate against the us dollar , the resulting impact on the us manufacturing industry could slow the american economy , undermining its import demand and thus hurting the word ’s exporters .
forecasts for us economic growth have been revised downward significantly since the federal reserve ’s interest-rate hike in december .
depressed equity markets and falling bond yields worldwide in january 2016 thus illustrate the global nature of the problem we face .
demand is still depressed by the overhang of debt accumulated before 2008 .
indeed , this pre-2008 debt has not gone away ; it has simply been shifted between sectors and countries .
paris – us president donald trump has shaken a transatlantic alliance that had long seemed unshakable .
in a january interview , he labeled nato “ obsolete ” and the european union a “ vehicle for germany . ”
the eu will soon collapse , he predicted , with a succession of countries following the united kingdom out .
the united states , his position suggests , would be more than fine with that .
with trump , the world is becoming accustomed to shocking declarations and shameless reversals .
those that survived did so only barely , with greatly reduced output going mainly to the ex-soviet market .
russia has the know-how , skilled engineering , and natural-resource base to become a global competitor in a range of major high-tech industries , including nuclear energy , commercial aviation , commercial space technology ( including satellites and gps ) , ict hardware and software , electric vehicles , high-speed rail , petrochemicals , and heavy equipment for the mining and hydrocarbon sectors .
all of these industries will benefit from the potential for enormous demand growth in large markets , such as china , africa , and india .
but achieving long-term growth led by high-tech industries requires a business environment that encourages private-sector investment , including openness to foreign players .
moreover , the social and political environment must be conducive to a high-tech labor force , providing an attractive quality of life , ensuring civil liberties , and supporting entrepreneurship and creativity .
of course , the situation is not cut and dried .
the return to public investment is affected by the presence or absence of complementary reforms , which vary from country to country .
and there is some potential for abuse , with expenditures being misclassified as investments .
yet , in an environment of low long-term interest rates and deficient short-term aggregate demand ( which means there is little risk of crowding out the private sector ) , it is a mistake not to relax fiscal constraints for investment .
in fact , the right kind of public investment would probably spur more private-sector investment .
the central issue in these television programs is not that the main roles are played by women .
character , not gender , drives the narrative .
outside of the united states , women have already reached the highest level of power .
in germany , chancellor angela merkel , having won three general elections , is respected or resented for her austerity policies , not for her gender .
argentina ’s president cristina fernández de kirchner is attacked for mismanaging the economy , and by us banking interests for forcing debt restructuring on her country ’s creditors , not because she is a woman .
bernanke has emphasized that these two policies are on separate tracks and will respond to different indicators of the economy ’s performance .
the federal open market committee ( fomc ) , comprising the fed governors and the presidents of the regional federal reserve banks , has agreed that the federal funds rate will remain at its current near-zero level until the unemployment rate drops to 6.5 % and can be expected to remain there or decline even further .
with unemployment now at 7.6 % and falling only slowly , the fed may not be ready to raise the federal funds rate until 2015 .
but there are caveats that make this forward guidance ambiguous – and therefore uninformative .
the fed warns that it might increase the federal funds rate if the anticipated annual inflation rate rises from its current level of a bit less than 2 % to more than 2.5 % .
and , with housing , healthcare , and education less accessible now than at the end of the 1980 ’s , his political program focuses on what should be done to improve russia ’s human capital – the key problem holding back russia ’s economy .
according to prokhorov , productivity in russia is just 6-10 % of that in the us , which is why the economy struggles even when the price of oil , its main export , is peaking .
two million educated professionals have recently emigrated from russia .
during the last 20 years , social inequality has grown threefold .
russia , prokhorov concludes , is a feudal society , with putin ’s political monopoly and economic mismanagement exacerbating the so-called “ natural-resource curse ” that afflicts many oil-exporting countries .
it is important that the united states ( ideally , joined by other countries ) let iran know that any action to put itself in a position to field nuclear weapons after 15 years , though not explicitly precluded by the accord , will not be tolerated .
harsh sanctions should be reintroduced at the first sign that iran is preparing a post-jcpoa breakout ; this , too , is not precluded by the accord .
iran should likewise be informed that the us and its allies would undertake a preventive military strike if it appeared to be attempting to present the world with a fait accompli .
the world erred in allowing north korea to pass the nuclear-weapons threshold ; it should not make the same mistake again .
in the meantime , a major effort must be launched to assuage the concerns of iran ’s neighbors , several of which will be tempted to hedge their bets against iran ’s potential breakout in 15 years by pursuing nuclear programs of their own .
short-term exchange-rate movements are no way to judge a currency ’s underlying strength .
longer-term trends in how money is used internationally – particularly as a store of value for foreign investors or central banks – are far more telling .
in the context of the coming years , rather than just the next few weeks , trump ’s election will almost certainly be bad for the greenback .
for starters , the dollar has shot up since the election only because trump has promised to enact deep tax cuts and ramp up spending on decaying infrastructure and america ’s supposedly “ depleted ” military .
this will boost near-term economic growth and inevitably push interest rates up .
but this happy outlook for may rests on one crucial assumption : that the march 29 brexit deadline will remain unchanged .
european leaders could easily neutralize may ’s threat of a no-deal brexit and therefore eliminate any need to offer the concessions she demands .
to do this , they must understand the method behind may ’s maddening strategy of indecision and delay .
throughout her political career , may has used procrastination as a winning strategy .
as home secretary , she often won battles against other ministers simply by refusing to express her views or even to appear at meetings until minutes before a final decision had to be made .
and it ranks 58th for institutional quality , owing to excessive government regulations , opaque corporate governance , and policy instability .
finally , productivity in the services sector amounts to just 45 % that of the manufacturing sector , on average , compared with an oecd average of 90 % .
the problem is most acute in finance , real estate , business services , and community and government services .
externally , south korea is highly vulnerable to the escalating north korean nuclear threat .
in recent months , north korea has fired several ballistic missiles and conducted a nuclear test , spurring an exchange of incendiary rhetoric between north korean leader kim jong-un and us president donald trump .
it is not sustainable for the people of smolensk oblast to live under constitutional democracy , while the citizens of grozny and sukhumi are the victims of wanton shelling and destruction .
the history of colonialism in western europe and japan , of slavery in the us , shows that as liberal democratic ideals take root in a society , the rights of citizenship can not be denied to colonial subjects of members or certain groups .
thus , if russia continues along an imperialist line , its democracy will be at risk .
second , continued imperialism in the near-abroad and in chechnya strengthens reactionary forces who oppose liberal democracy .
the political and military elements which lament the demise of the soviet state feed on the resources devoted to extend russian influence in the non-russian republics .
from the japanese perspective , there was an `` account of victimization , '' in which `` atomic bombs have become the symbol of a specific type of suffering -- rather similar to the holocaust for the jews . ''
at the hiroshima museum itself , the victim role has been exploited in ways that similarly distort memory .
neither the japanese government 's responsibility for initiating and continuing the war nor the inhumane treatment that prisoners of war or the subject civilian populations suffered under japanese rule are adequately acknowledged .
everyone chooses the point of view that fits him best .
whether we identify with the heroes or the victims , with the pilots of the plane that put an end to wwii or with the passive population subjected to the hell of atomic annihilation , we are always rooting with the `` innocents '' and the `` good guys . ''
the intended beneficiaries of these actions should be defined as rights-holders .
accountability mechanisms should be established , allowing victims to hold governments responsible for their failure to take action .
this removes the stigma of charity , and it is empowering for victims .
instead of being helped because they have unsatisfied needs , they are granted remedies because their rights are being violated .
the framework also should include a non-discrimination requirement , ensuring that we focus our attention on the most vulnerable groups – not just the well-connected , the literate , and the favorites of the regime , and not just groups for which quick wins can be achieved .
the most important problem that needs to be resolved is not america ’s massive bilateral trade deficit with china .
it is that the chinese are stealing us firms ’ technology and using it to help chinese companies compete with those same firms in china and around the world .
the chinese do this in two ways .
first , us firms that want to do business in china are required to have a chinese partner and to share their technology with that firm .
that compulsory sharing of technology is explicitly forbidden by world trade organization rules .
this struggle within islam pits pluralism against purification .
it is ripping countries and regions apart , luring people to travel halfway around the world to join jihad , and threatening to unleash more violence against muslims , as well as against christians , jews , and others .
but the battle within islam is not a satisfactory or sufficient explanation for the state of anarchy we see in a place like south sudan , whose 11 million people gained independence just over three years ago .
though the world 's newest country emerged from a bitter civil war between christians and muslims , the independence referendum received 99 % support .
yet today 1.5 million of its citizens have been uprooted , which has nothing to do with islam and everything to do with a struggle along ethnic lines for control of the country 's resources .
in the us , the troubled asset relief program ( tarp ) , which former president george w. bush signed into law in october 2008 , started out as a program whereby the department of the treasury purchased problematic , largely mortgage-based assets directly from financial institutions .
but that turned out to be more complicated than originally thought , and , within weeks , the government simply recapitalized us banks instead .
other bad decisions were not so easily reversed .
hoping to prevent a bank run , the irish government offered a blanket guarantee for all banking deposits .
with that one unilateral decision , ireland destabilized the rest of europe .
hate speech and other kinds of dangerous and illegal content must be attacked at the source .
on one hand , there is a need for increased media literacy on the part of consumers , who need to be taught , from a young age , about the real-world consequences of online hate speech .
on the other hand – and this is what the netzdg attempts to ensure – social-media platforms must ensure that their products are designed in ways that encourage responsible use .
but this is no quick fix .
on the contrary , it demands a fundamental rethink of business models that facilitate and even reward hate speech .
independently of what we think about britain leaving the eu , we can ask two other questions , one general and one specific to brexit .
first , to what extent should the citizens of a democracy be able to make decisions directly , in a referendum , rather than through their elected representatives ?
and , more specifically , should british legislators consider themselves bound by the outcome of the june 23 referendum ?
on the general question , the strongest argument for direct democracy is that it follows from the idea of democracy itself , subject only to a feasibility constraint .
in earlier times , small city-states could be direct democracies ; but in larger countries , when communication was slow , it was necessary to elect representatives to decide the many questions that needed to be discussed and voted upon .
they regard a request for backdoors the same way an automobile manufacturer would view a request for a defective engine .
a large coalition of technology companies and civil-society organizations recently sent a letter to president barack obama arguing against backdoors .
in addition to “ undermining every american ’s cyber security and the nation ’s economic security , ” the signers argued , “ introducing new vulnerabilities to weaken encrypted products in the us would also undermine human rights and information security around the globe . ”
what supporters of encryption recognize is that “ if american companies maintain the ability to unlock their customers ’ data and devices on request , governments other than the united states will demand the same access , and will also be emboldened to demand the same capability from their native companies . ”
the us government will not be able to object , given its own policies .
kuala lumpur – malaysia ’s year-old government , led by prime minister mahathir mohamad , suddenly finds itself mired in a political scandal , following the online circulation of a sex video involving a cabinet minister and another man .
weaponized sodomy charges are nothing new in malaysia , twice resulting in the imprisonment of people ’s justice party leader anwar ibrahim .
unfortunately , the latest drama , like those preceding it , risks obscuring more essential problems .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
macron has also signaled that he will pursue a pan-european campaign for the 2019 european parliament election .
as a democrat , he believes that the deepening of the european union must go hand in hand with the development of a truly european political space .
at a time of much hand-wringing over the decline of liberalism , the future of social democracy , the rise of nationalism , and the backlash against globalization , macron ’s unapologetically internationalist stance is notable .
in fact , macron has taken a leap into the unknown of the west ’s “ new politics , ” a terrain no longer defined entirely by competition between large center-right and center-left parties .
but is politics really turning the page on the traditional right-left cleavage ?
london – most pundits agree that the least bad way to deal with north korea ’s nuclear saber rattling is a continued combination of tight containment and aggressive diplomacy .
fewer , however , have recognized that the least bad military option – the one implied by us president donald trump ’s insistence that china take responsibility for its dangerous neighbor – is a chinese invasion , or regime change forced through china ’s threat to launch one .
this outcome , which would sharply shift east asia ’s strategic balance in china ’s favor , is not as unlikely as most people think .
in fact , its very plausibility is one reason why it needs to be taken seriously , including by chinese military planners .
in trumpian terms , this is a “ china first ” option that could help “ make china great again . ”
spiekermann , a global authority on the trafficking of our online identities for purposes of targeted advertising , political propaganda , public and private surveillance , or other nefarious purposes , emphasizes the need to crack down on “ personal data markets . ”
“ ever since the world economic forum started to discuss personal data as a new asset class in 2011 , ” she told me , “ personal data markets have thrived on the idea that personal data might be the ‘ new oil ’ of the digital economy as well as – so it seems – of politics . ”
as a result , “ more than a thousand companies are now involved in a digital information value chain that harvests data from any online activity and delivers targeted content to online or mobile users within roughly 36 seconds of their entry into the digital realm . ”
nor is it “ just facebook and google , apple or amazon that harvest and use our data for any purpose one might think of , ” spiekermann says .
“‘ data management platforms ’ such as those operated by acxiom or oracle bluekai possess thousands of personal attributes and socio-psychological profiles about hundreds of millions of users . ”
it gives the poor access to a wider variety of commodities , while providing firms with a more diverse selection of inputs .
but increased trade can also eliminate low-skill factory jobs and reduce agricultural prices – outcomes that disproportionately hurt the poor .
in india , for example , poverty has declined more slowly in areas where farmers face increased foreign competition .
given constraints on inter-sectoral labor mobility , stemming from barriers to skills acquisition and rigid labor-market regulations , the poorest workers have few options when such changes occur .
as a result , increased trade may demand difficult adjustments in the short term .
kenyans need similar means of reflection today .
and yet , just when the country ’s democratic institutions could most benefit from such a mirror , those who have historically held it up now believe they have no alternative but to put it down .
for kenya , the very public decline of the nation has come at a high cost .
but it has also demonstrated that press freedom means much more than letting journalists say what they want , when they want , and how they want .
it also means holding media owners accountable .
the recession of 2001 combined an inventory downturn with an investment downturn .
the first is now over ; the second -- the result of overinvestment in high technology and telecommunications , the sectors that were so important in the boom of the late 90s -- may last considerably longer .
there remains a considerable capacity overhang -- such as fiber optic lines that remain dark , having yet to see any light pass through them .
merely lowering interest rates did not , and will not , lead firms to invest more in these sectors .
the good news -- and the bad -- is that the pace of technological change in these sectors is sufficiently fast that much of the equipment may become obsolete well before it is worn out , or even used , enabling new investment to start faster than it otherwise would .
once the bureaucracy and broad parameters for the negotiations are established by early next year , may will formally launch the withdrawal process by invoking article 50 of the treaty of lisbon .
two years of negotiations ( longer if the eu agrees ) will follow .
the three brexiteers , after fighting one another like rats in a sack , will have had to come up with a package .
by then , the next general election will not be far off , providing a second stamp of approval for brexit .
that , at least , is the formal plan .
warsaw – in paris , west berlin , london , and rome , the spring of 1968 was marked by student protests against the vietnam war .
in warsaw , too , students were protesting , but their cause was not the same as their western counterparts .
young poles took to the streets of warsaw not to chant “ ho , ho , ho chi minh ” in solidarity with the viet cong , but rather to defend their own country ’s freedom and culture against a smothering communist rule .
instead of chanting ho ’s name , young poles put flowers under the monument of adam mickiewicz , a nineteenth-century poet whose drama forefathers eve , written in praise of the struggle for freedom , had recently been declared subversive and anti-soviet , and its performance at the national theater in warsaw closed down .
these are only a few of the differences between west and east european students in that springtime of rebellion of forty years ago .
crucially , the figures are comparable across a large set of middle - and low-income countries and also with data available for advanced countries .
preliminary conclusions emerging from these studies will illuminate political debates – and likely annoy ideologues of both the right and the left .
start , lustig argues in a recent paper , with the fact that world income inequality is not rising .
consider the gini coefficient , the most common measure of inequality , which runs from a value of zero for perfect equality to 100 for perfect inequality ( one person receives all the income ) .
the average gini score ( not weighted by population ) in countries for which there are data declined slightly in the 2000-2010 period , from 39 to 38 .
likewise , while policies that encourage firms to increase wages will raise household income and domestic consumption , wage increases can erode export competitiveness and choke off inflows of foreign direct investment .
with rebalancing policies alone unlikely to increase average output growth substantially , enhancing productivity is crucial to china ’s long-term prosperity .
the final piece of the puzzle for china is realism .
as it stands , the chinese government is keen to maintain decent growth of about 7 % annually while pushing for rebalancing and reform .
the risk is that , until reform measures take effect , the authorities may rely on short-term stimulus to meet growth targets , aggravating resource misallocation and structural vulnerabilities .
and , by shutting down such a prominent us-supported institution , he can send a message that no one who has stood up to him has won .
despots throughout history have used the same tactics .
but orbán is doing so in the eu of 2017 .
it is worth remembering that , in order to join the eu , hungary had to meet stringent accession criteria , including credible democratic institutions and adherence to the rule of law .
the fact that those high standards are now being systematically eroded has introduced a paradox for the eu .
soros : the ecb is a functioning institution .
so long as it acts within its powers , germany is not in a position to veto it .
this is why i am hopeful that something really significant might come out of the deliberations currently taking place behind closed doors .
question : do you think the current economic crisis is possibly the final step in a general philosophical crisis in the west ?
soros : i discussed this in 2000 , in my book on the crisis of global capitalism .
moreover , it is not as though a flat tax on capital gains will hinder social mobility or increase poverty .
in fact , since sweden adopted the same tax system in 1991 , its average annual rate of productivity growth has increased by a factor of four .
social mobility in france has not experienced any major change since 1991 .
by moving away from a system of universal eligibility at the university level to one that finds a more appropriate fit for all students after high school , france stands to benefit from more genuine equality and greater social mobility .
macron ’s revolution is on the move .
in addition to individual businesses , entire value chains that contribute heavily to the country ’s gdp have suffered a sudden operational and financial freeze .
but while many observers have focused on the scandals ’ short-term political and economic fallout , it is worth remembering what brazil stands to gain by exposing corruption and punishing offenders .
reforming the relationship between brazil ’s public and private sectors can improve the country ’s long-term economic performance .
the ongoing prosecutions have already changed the calculus for any economic agent who is thinking about violating the public ’s trust for private gain .
there is now a widespread perception that those who engage in illicit dealings have a higher probability of being caught and punished , regardless of their social status .
as the union races ahead , it seems that it has lost europe 's citizens along the way .
many are turning their backs on the whole project .
they have trouble seeing what is common to europe .
they do not feel part of the great whole .
even in the new member states , enthusiasm for the european family of democracies is cooling .
these include trump ’s former national security adviser , michael flynn , who lied about his conversations with the russian ambassador during the transition ( probably about lifting sanctions that president barack obama had imposed on russian businesses ) .
moreover , the president ’s son , donald trump , jr. , along with other top campaign officials , met in trump tower with a russian intelligence agent with ties to the kremlin who had promised “ dirt ” on clinton .
it had been widely expected that trump ’s son would face indictment as well – even donald , jr. , had said so – but barr ’s announcement ruled out further prosecutions .
another prominent escapee from the special counsel ’s hammer was trump ’s son-in-law , jared kushner , who is widely believed to have used his white house role , especially in foreign policy ( in which he ’d had no experience ) , to attend to his family ’s need for funds to pay off a huge real-estate debt .
trump himself is still vulnerable to investigations initiated by or handed off to federal and state prosecutors outside of washington .
backroom dealings and violence continue to rule the day .
pundits claim that arabs can not manage democracy .
in fact , the us and its allies simply do n’t like the results of arab democracy , which all too often produces governments that are nationalist , anti-israel , islamist , and dangerous to america ’s oil interests .
when the ballots go in that direction , the us simply ignores the election results ( as it did , for example , in 2006 , when hamas won a large majority of the popular vote in gaza ) .
the us can not stop the spiral of violence in the middle east .
cambridge : after a wasted decade , the world is rousing itself against the aids pandemic sweeping through the world ’s poorest countries , especially in africa and south-asia .
the pandemic has claimed 19 million lives , and created 13 million orphans .
34 million more people live with the hiv virus that causes aids ; virtually all are marked for early death .
while first identified in the us in the early 1980s , aids is now concentrated in poor countries : 25 million people suffer from it in africa ; 6 million more in asia .
in parts of southern africa more than 20 % of adults are afflicted .
in most cases , the laws for skies mirror those governing the world ’s oceans .
oceans belong to everyone except those near landmasses , which are managed in a similar manner to the country 's land-bound borders .
as a result , the sky is usually conceptualized in terms of traffic .
airliners and fighter planes operate in “ controlled ” air close to the ground , while nationality is supposed to matter less the higher you go .
fragile treaties that cover this are enforced mostly by the fact that few nations can afford to place assets that high .
in fact , few other trends pose a bigger threat to global stability .
almost all societies have become heavily dependent on the internet , the world ’s most important piece of infrastructure – and also the infrastructure upon which all other infrastructure relies .
the so-called internet of things is a misnomer ; soon enough , it will be the “ internet of everything . ”
and our current era is not a fourth industrial revolution ; it is the beginning of the digital age , and the end of the industrial age altogether .
the digital age has introduced new vulnerabilities that hackers , cyber criminals , and other malign actors are already routinely exploiting .
wto membership will also force the government to cease discriminating in favor of soes and against economic sectors with a high degree of private ownership , including agriculture .
china 's industrialization strategy in the pre-reform era rejected the notion of " comparative advantage " - the principle that an economy produces some goods more efficiently than others owing to factors such as natural resources , geography , and climate .
jamaica , say , does not produce frozen salmon or hockey players because investing in industries such as citrus fruit and tourism provides far more certain profits .
the same wto-induced sectoral adjustment underlies the decline of steel and textiles in advanced countries such as the us .
in china , most soes survived because central planners emphasized economic autarky , regardless of cost .
there are also some who believe that the eurozone ’s fiscal and monetary framework locks italy into weak nominal gdp growth , possibly too-low inflation , and high debt .
yet before the new government took office , italy ’s cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit – as opposed to its underlying debt position – was often rather restrained compared to the rest of the eurozone , as well as the other members of the g7 ( canada , france , germany , japan , the united kingdom , and the united states ) .
still , the mainstream political parties that governed italy until this year did not deliver the nominal gdp growth that the country needs .
as a result , italians elected an unconventional coalition whose program combines the policies of the populist left with those of the populist right .
while the league party promises to cut taxes , the five star movement ( m5s ) is pursuing a form of basic income .
encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work .
an effective strategy must accomplish two tasks : encourage investment in non-traditional areas , and weed out projects and investments that fail .
for this , governments must deploy both the carrot and the stick .
learning what a country is ( or can be ) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development .
the carrot is needed because there is great social value in discovering , for example , that cut flowers , or soccer balls , or computer software can be produced at low cost , because this knowledge can orient the investments of other entrepreneurs .
combining these conservative assumptions about potential gdp with the effect of the cyclical rebound – an estimated 1.2 % annual rise in real gdp – would produce real gdp growth at an average annual rate of 2.6 % , which would be significantly higher than the 1.9 % rate in the decade ending in 2009 .
but not all of the extra output produced over the next decade will remain in the us .
if the trade deficit is reduced by 3 % of gdp between now and the end of the decade , the implied rise in exports and decline in imports would reduce output available for us consumption and investment by about 0.3 % per year .
the effect of a decline in the dollar over the coming decade could be equally important .
if the real trade-weighted value of the dollar falls by 25 % over the coming decade , and the full effect of that dollar decline is reflected in import prices , the increased cost of imports would reduce the growth of us real incomes by about 0.4 % a year .
the holdouts claimed that , if the new bonds were being serviced in full ( as they were ) , equal treatment required that the holdouts should receive the full amount owed to them ( including not only interest but also principal ) .
the us second circuit court of appeals ruled that argentina was bound to honor its obligations to the holdout bondholders in the same proportion ( namely 100 % ) as the holders of the exchange bonds .
it was that ruling that the supreme court recently upheld .
under the court order , argentina may not pay the holders of the new bonds unless it also pays the holdouts , and no us financial institution can serve as an intermediary to make payments for argentina .
as a result , argentina must either pay the holdouts in full or default on the new bonds .
china has now embarked on a $ 1.4-billion project to build a sprawling complex roughly the size of monaco on reclaimed land in colombo – a “ port city " that will become a major stop on china 's nautical “ road . "
zhou bo , an honorary fellow with the pla academy of military science , admits that china 's mega-projects “ will fundamentally change the political and economic landscape of the indian ocean , " while presenting china as a “ strong yet benign " power .
this is important , because the new asian order will be determined less by developments in east asia , where japan is determined to block china 's rise , than by events in the indian ocean , where china is chipping away at india 's longstanding dominance .
india is certainly suspicious of china 's behavior .
but china is treading carefully enough that it can continue to advance its goals , without spooking its intended quarry .
yet sharif was an honored guest at modi ’s inauguration , exchanging gifts with india ’s newly affable leader .
the modi government has also adopted the upa-proposed goods and services tax , which had been stalled by opposition from bjp-ruled states ( including modi ’s gujarat ) .
and it will strengthen the national anti-terrorism effort , which modi previously denounced as an assault on indian federalism .
many modi supporters in the media have already begun to decry the series of policy abdications modi has conducted since his campaign .
indian citizens who thought that they voted for change are beginning to wonder if the bjp has simply reprised the upa government ’s policies .
in all conflicts , human rights are among the first casualties , and in the middle east the degradation of human dignity has now undone international conventions agreed over several generations .
we should look to the helsinki process to show us how to retrieve what has been lost .
with today ’s emphasis on military action in the so-called “ war on terror , ” the need for a conference to discuss security and military affairs , combined with a stability charter , has become urgent .
a regional agenda must be created to help identify priorities , based on a three-pronged strategy that includes energy and water policy , arms control , and debt reduction .
europe ’s contributions to the middle east have been great .
they did what they could to ensure that no meaningful reforms occurred during the crisis , with the knowledge that after the crisis , momentum for reform would dissipate .
they were more right than they knew .
who , after all , could have anticipated that bill clinton would be followed by a us president committed to undermining the multilateral system in all its manifestations ?
for example , when the imf correctly suggested , after argentina ’s crisis , that there needed to be a better way of restructuring debt ( an international bankruptcy procedure ) , the us vetoed the initiative .
when the oecd proposed an agreement to restrict bank secrecy , the bush administration vetoed that initiative , too .
bangkok – earlier this month , an estimated 100,000 hong kong residents gathered in victoria park , to mark the 28th anniversary of china violent repression of pro-democracy protesters in beijing ’s tiananmen square .
as the south china morning post noted , the event in hong kong was the only large-scale public commemoration of june 4 , 1989 , permitted on chinese soil .
and , to the attendees , the hong kong demonstration reflected growing frustration , not only with china ’s leaders , but also with their own .
on the surface , little has changed since the united kingdom returned hong kong to china 20 years ago .
but , in reality , china now exercises near total control over hong kong ’s management .
what plays well with one group may not sit well with another .
and , to be sustainable , a successful vision must also be an effective diagnosis of the situation that a group faces .
leaders must get the question right before proposing answers .
to choose goals and articulate them in a vision , they need not only to solicit input from their followers , but also to understand the context of their choices .
they must be able to assess reality accurately .
sixth , sanctions are said to weaken the targeted governments .
but by worsening the business and investment climate , economic sanctions take their toll primarily on the private sector .
if anything , power becomes more centralized and concentrated as governments increasingly control supplies of strategic commodities given the shortages they cause .
finally , sanctions are supposedly effective in containing nuclear proliferation .
here , too , their record is demonstrably poor .
central and eastern europe after 1989 , though a very interesting reference point for analysts of the arab revolutions , is not an appropriate reference point , because the region ’s new domestic and foreign order resulted from the change in external conditions stemming from the collapse of soviet power .
internally , nearly all of these countries had a very clear idea about what they wanted : democracy , freedom , a market economy , and protection from the return of the russian empire .
they wanted the west , and their accession to nato and the european union was logical .
nothing of the sort applies to the crisis belt of the middle east .
no power anywhere , within the region or without , is willing and able to implement the barest vision of a new regional order – or even a vision for parts of it .
new haven – by now , it ’s an all-too-familiar drill .
after an extended period of extraordinary monetary accommodation , the us federal reserve has begun the long march back to normalization .
it has now taken the first step toward returning its benchmark policy interest rate – the federal funds rate – to a level that imparts neither stimulus nor restraint to the us economy .
a majority of financial market participants applaud this strategy .
in fact , it is a dangerous mistake .
the danger for central banks stems from the fact that the implicit subsidies provided to major financial institutions are not measured in any budget .
moreover , the build-up of risk in the financial system that accompanies higher leverage is both hard to measure and likely to materialize only after a few years ( for example , after a governor ’s term of office has expired ) .
de gregorio ’s views differ from those of many of his colleagues in other countries , because he sees clearly the risks in allowing banks to become bigger and apply what he calls “ clever ” strategies that require a great deal of leverage .
higher leverage creates macroeconomic risk – not least for fiscal balances when implicit guarantees must be honored .
by keeping banks and other private-sector firms at lower levels of debt , vulnerability to shocks is reduced .
new york – there has been no shortage of scrutiny of what russian president vladimir putin is up to in syria and why .
much of the analysis , though , has been narrowly focused on the short term and may be too negative in assessing his actions ’ likely long-term consequences .
what we know is that putin has decided to come to the aid of bashar al-assad ’s embattled regime .
russian bombs and missiles are now raining down on an array of armed groups that have been fighting syrian government forces , which has given the regime the breathing space that russia ’s intervention was intended to provide .
as bad as the assad government is , and as much as it has to answer for , this outcome is arguably preferable in the short run to the regime ’s collapse .
this may be interpreted broadly as part of the rules-based global trade framework .
using data for 2017 , we find that the number of anti-dumping and countervailing ( anti-subsidy ) cases lodged by all wto member countries against exporting countries ( the log value of which is on the vertical axis of the graph below ) tends to decline as the income level of the exporter increases ( shown by the log value on the horizontal axis ) .
each blue dot on the graph represents a wto member economy , and the solid black line shows the international average ( drawn from all member economies excluding china ) .
the data pattern is fairly clear : as a country becomes richer , there are fewer anti-subsidy or anti-dumping cases against it .
this could be because richer countries observe rules better , are less likely to attract complaints as their labor costs rise , or some combination of the two .
most bets are on britain formally leaving the eu in march 2019 , but “ temporarily ” remaining in the customs union , giving it two or three years to negotiate the final divorce settlement .
the brexiteers will be enraged by such a “ soft ” exit , but it will probably be enough to ensure parliamentary approval .
the referendum decision to leave the eu will be honored , but its harsh economic consequences will be postponed : a triumph of pragmatism over ideology .
if the brexit trajectory turns out this way , it will be a good illustration of the double character – and function – of politics .
john maynard keynes put the matter well : “ words ought to be a little wild , for they are the assault of thoughts upon the unthinking , ” he wrote in 1933 .
the atmosphere could not have been more tranquil : a former royal castle in the rolling hills of the taunus region near frankfurt , where statesmen and politicians held an annual meeting dealing with the middle east .
europeans and americans , israelis and iranians , egyptians and turks , palestinians and tunisians rubbed shoulders .
the novelty this year was the presence of representatives from post-saddam iraq , among them an official from the kurdish regional government , as well as a high ranking shi'a representative .
the new situation in iraq , along with the middle east road map , were at the center of attention .
on the opening night , a senior german government minister , himself deeply involved in middle eastern affairs , addressed both subjects , displaying great sensitivity both to israeli and palestinian concerns .
last friday , cairo was paralyzed , despite an almost-complete lack of coverage by local media outlets .
and ramadan – now underway – is mobilization-friendly .
after sunset , there is a common program .
observant muslims gather at sundown for iftar ( breakfast ) , followed by evening prayers , tawarih ( longer prayers , including a short sermon ) , social interactions , qiyyam ( another late-night prayer ) , suhur ( another collective meal ) , and then morning prayers .
the last ten days of ramadan are i ‘ tikaf ( collective seclusion ) , during which worshippers gather and spend nights in mosques and open areas .
as africa ’s leading development-finance institution , the african development bank will support our north african members , enhancing governance and institutions , strengthening social safety nets , and laying the basis for a strong economic recovery .
as we finance infrastructure and other projects in the region , we will seek to integrate disenfranchised regions and rural areas .
we are broadening our consultations with governments and other actors , and we are collaborating more closely with national and regional civil-society groups and the media , as well as with academic institutions , think tanks , labor unions , and industrial and sectoral associations .
with the emerging democratic dispensation , we have partners with whom we can engage on governance issues .
no country or region can truly aspire to full , broad-based economic growth without pulling along all segments of its population and without giving a voice to all .
even many of the poorest countries seemed , at long last , to be joining in , posting strong growth on the back of rising energy and raw material prices , renewed mining investments from abroad , and increasing fiscal revenues .
although the numbers were never as rosy as market enthusiasts seemed to think , they did divert attention away from the shaky foundations of the newfound prosperity .
the growing need for measures to correct global imbalances was met with disbelief by influential policymakers and market analysts alike : “ why change a winning formula ? ”
the fate of the rest of the world depends on the responses to the unfolding financial turmoil .
the contraction of property and stock markets will undoubtedly dampen us household borrowing and demand , potentially triggering a downward spiral .
manila – food shortages are a distant memory for many people in asia .
but as the region struggles to feed and nourish a booming population , they could become a painful fact of life again .
asia is already the world ’s largest food market , and by 2050 its population is expected to grow to five billion – an increase of 900 million people .
owing to its expanding middle class , the region will likely account for half of the global increase in annual beef and poultry consumption and over three quarters of the rise in fish consumption between now and 2030 .
and by then , more than 60 % of total cereal demand in the developing world will come from south and east asia .
what the us needs is to explain better to its own people why america should engage more deeply with the middle east ’s mounting problems .
this is not to say that the us should necessarily engage with every problem .
but , whether america is engaged or not , it does need a policy .
syria is a case in point .
the situation there , predicted by every pundit around , has metastasized and threatens to become a full-blown regional civil war .
london – cybersecurity is one of the defining challenges of the digital age .
everyone , from households to businesses to governments , has a stake in protecting our era ’s most valuable commodity : data .
the question is how that can be achieved .
the scale of the challenge should not be underestimated .
with attackers becoming increasingly nimble and innovative , armed with an increasingly diverse array of weapons , cyber-attacks are happening at a faster pace and with greater sophistication than ever before .
this is not the only way forward .
integration of immigrants makes much sense ; but it is desirable to help create sustainable conditions in troubled countries with the help of a generation of emigrants who first transfer resources and then return themselves .
many consequences follow from such home truths about immigration , not least a more rational debate .
viewed from the perspective such truths provide , the european union 's eastward enlargement , for example , is highly desirable not despite but because it may lead to migration from the new member states to the old .
in this way , more portugals and irelands can be created as the wealth of already prosperous regions is sustained .
the cost is tiny : reaching 80 % of the world ’s 140 million or so undernourished children would require a commitment of around $ 60 million annually , while the economic gains would eventually clear $ 1 billion a year .
providing iron and iodized salt is another top investment .
fortifying products with iron costs as little as $ 0.12 per person , per year .
we know that iron deficiency leads to cognitive and developmental problems .
for $ 286 million we could get iodized salt and fortified basic food items to 80 % of those in the worst-affected areas , with benefits estimated to be roughly nine times that sum .
standardization and liberalization in european telecoms underpinned 9 % growth in value added and productivity in this period , compared to 6 % growth in the us .
the largest scope for renewed private investment is in capital-intensive sectors in which government has a major presence as regulator .
even if european countries were to close only 10 % of the variation in capital stock per worker at the subsector level , the impact could be more than € 360 billion in additional investment – offsetting the € 354 billion difference in private investment between 2007 and 2011 .
many projects , from airports to university campuses , benefit from returns over decades , which implies that weak demand in the short term will have only a limited impact on their overall viability .
even among more near-term projects , some – for example , retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient features – could become viable with action from policymakers .
as a result , the differential between growth in the emerging and advanced economies – aggregated from imf data , and including hong kong , singapore , south korea , and taiwan in the emerging group – has declined considerably .
indeed , after averaging three percentage points for two decades and rising to 4.8 percentage points in 2010 , the percentage-point differential fell to 2.5 last year and is expected to amount to just 1.5 this year .
the question , then , is whether the growth differential will remain as low at it is today .
those who believe that it will , typically rely on three arguments , all of which require some qualification .
first , they argue that much convergence has already taken place in manufacturing .
in practice , the proliferation of new safeguards has introduced a high degree of moral hazard and created perverse incentives for governments and market participants alike .
under the latest eurozone reforms , the principle that those who assume a risk should be liable for it has been replaced by a principle of joint liability , implying financial transfers on an unprecedented scale in the event of a crisis .
the current situation in italy should serve as a warning to all those advocating risk sharing .
making matters worse , the sole focus on solidarity means that the eurozone ’s real problems have gone unaddressed .
these include high levels of public and private debt , weak institutions , overregulated markets , and still-incomplete balance-sheet corrections on the part of corporations and banks .
the hoped-for break with the past did not occur , as political infighting among the country ’s new leaders blocked the implementation of any serious reform agenda .
but 2004 was also a bitter failure for russian president vladimir putin , who tried to bring his favored presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych , to power in kyiv by supporting massive vote manipulation .
the failure was a bitter blow to the kremlin , one that was neither forgiven nor forgotten .
then , in 2010 , the orange revolution ’s failure brought yanukovych to power in a free and fair election , and in 2012 putin selected himself for a third presidential term in russia .
the creation of a new eurasia union was a key part of his platform .
following the east asia crisis of 1997 came seven years of capital drought .
the third cycle of inflows occurred in 2004-2011 , persisting even through the global financial crisis .
if history repeats itself , it is now time for a third “ sudden stop ” of capital flows to emerging markets .
are a couple of data points and a biblical parable enough to take the hypothesis of a 15-year cycle seriously ?
perhaps , if we have some sort of causal theory that could explain such periodicity to international capital flows .
jefferson and madison did not want the country ’s capital to be in the north , and hamilton reluctantly agreed to support moving it to an area carved out of virginia or maryland .
they , in turn , would secure the votes for the federal government to assume and repay the states ’ defaulted debts .
a responsible fiscal state emerged from that grand compromise .
despite the enormous cost – more than half of the fledgling government ’s expenditures in early years went to debt service – the economy shook off the 1780 ’s depression and entered a growth boom .
hamilton ’s task was both easier and harder than ours is today .
digital id could play a much more expansive role in the way individuals and institutions interact with each other .
digital id systems that succeed in driving high adoption could create significant economic value for individuals , businesses , and government institutions .
as we document in a new report , digital ids have the potential to reduce fraud rates , cut customer onboarding costs , boost financial inclusion , and deepen savings and credit for under-banked customers .
they can also spur development by enabling digital talent matching and streamlined employee verification , resulting in higher participation in the labor market .
digital ids could even establish a means to control data and digital footprints in interconnected online ecosystems .
if the revolution continues apace , it will disintegrate into incompetence , disillusionment , frenzied witch-hunts , and a recurring cycle of violence .
but if the revolution is aborted , its leaders will be unmasked as empty windbags .
the first revolution of 1917 toppled czar nicholas and created a provisional government that , headed by the socialist leader alexander kerensky , turned out to be a transitional blip .
lenin described kerensky as the “ balalaika ” played by the old order to continue to deceive the workers and peasants .
but the second revolution – which brought lenin and the bolsheviks to power – produced a regime that was no less vulnerable to accusations of betrayal .
below it , there is the opportunity to create a single banking supervisor , combining the functions of the office of the comptroller of the currency , the office of thrift supervision , and the regulatory functions of the regional feds .
in a perfect world , one would add in the state banking regulators , but i recognize that at this point i have begun to trample on cherished features of the us constitution !
this regulatory architecture would leave the fed free to speak openly about the development of the financial system as a whole , without worrying about the implications for individual institutions in its care .
the crisis has demonstrated that we need this plain speaking .
moreover , such a solution would protect the fed ’s crucial independence in its monetary-policy role .
in india , for example , there is fear that small mom-and-pop retailers will be crushed when wal-mart enters the market in the next few months .
but policymakers must recognize that there are ways to protect small retailers without stifling competition .
the government can , say , impose zoning regulations , help small retailers find specialized niches in the market , or provide skills training to displaced workers .
the survival of artisanal retailers should not be used as an excuse to introduce or uphold business regulations that ultimately protect the incumbent rich .
asian policymakers must remember how they successfully developed their manufacturing sector – through competition .
toulouse – if history punishes those who fail to learn from it , financial history does its punishing with a sadistic twist – it also punishes those who learn from it too enthusiastically .
time and again , financial crises have reflected the weaknesses of regulatory systems founded on the lessons learned from previous crises .
today ’s crisis is no exception ; nor will the next one be .
the post-war system of financial regulation was founded on three supposed lessons from the 1930 ’s .
first , we thought that the main reason why banks fail is that depositors panic , not that the main reason depositors panic is that banks are in danger of failing .
for china , the biggest prize is a bilateral investment treaty ( bit ) .
in practical terms , a us-china bit would make it easier for chinese entities to invest and operate in the us and increase american firms ’ access to chinese markets .
such a deal would be a near-term boon for xi , because it would represent a vote of confidence by the us in china ’s struggling economy .
but the prospects for a bit are uncertain , at best .
the us congress is deeply skeptical , and the american business community needs convincing as well .
this is especially interesting since it fundamentally rejects one of the most harrowing scenes from al gore ’s movie an inconvenient truth .
in graphic detail , gore demonstrated how a 20-foot rise in the sea level would inundate much of florida , shanghai , and holland .
the ipcc report makes it clear that exaggerations of this magnitude have no basis in science – though clearly they frightened people and perhaps will win gore an academy award .
the report also revealed the improbability of another gore scenario : that global warming could make the gulf stream shut down , turning europe into a new siberia .
the ipcc simply and tersely tells us that this scenario – also vividly depicted in the hollywood movie the day after tomorrow – is considered “ very unlikely . ”
it is important to note that china can still reduce the bilateral trade surplus against any particular partner , even if its overall surplus rises .
and even if the import expo expands , rather than reduces , the country ’s overall trade surplus , it may well have other benefits .
for starters , lowering the cost of imports will increase chinese households ’ purchasing power and their access to products that can improve their quality of life .
chinese firms , too , will benefit from lower costs for foreign-made parts and equipment , which will boost their global competitiveness – another channel through which lower import barriers can end up boosting exports .
finally , the international import expo will complement china ’s other measures to liberalize its market , including lower entry barriers for foreign financial firms .
across the west , many people are questioning whether russia will continue using natural gas as a means of putting economic and political pressure on ukraine , georgia , and other countries in what the kremlin regards as its “ near abroad . ”
using the “ energy weapon , ” however , is not just a tactic : it is at the heart of the prevailing doctrine guiding russian foreign policy .
russia ’s policy toward the post-soviet countries is based on the doctrine of a “ liberal empire , ” according to which russia ’s major government-owned and private companies should assume control of key economic entities across the territories of the former soviet republics by acquiring their assets .
in this context , the word “ liberal ” should be understood to suggest that the empire of the “ new russian dream ” should be built by purely economic means , excluding all forcible action against other nations .
naturally , the key role in this model is given to the supply of energy to the post-soviet countries .
cambridge – the united states congress is close to enacting a major tax reform .
the plan ’s most important provision reduces the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 20 % – from the highest among all oecd countries to one of the lowest – and allows us companies to repatriate the profits of their foreign subsidiaries without paying additional us taxes .
opponents of the legislation point to the resulting increase in the federal budget deficit , which will add $ 1.5 trillion to the government debt over the next ten years .
i dislike budget deficits , and i have long warned about their dangerous effects .
nonetheless , i believe that the economic benefits resulting from the corporate tax changes will outweigh the adverse effects of the increased debt .
we need a group of the major economies – call it “ g major ” – that announces monetary policies in a coordinated fashion .
to see why , consider the case of japan .
japanese policymakers have good reason to try to promote some inflation and even correct some of the yen ’s secular appreciation over the last six or seven years .
but , in today ’s unilateral world , other central banks would soon respond by injecting liquidity , prompting the bank of japan to act again .
these actions are usually justified as policies for boosting domestic demand , but they end up fueling a surrogate , low-grade currency war .
the difference in economic performance under democratic and republican presidents is consistent and substantial , with the disparities clearly above the threshold for statistical significance .
princeton university economists alan blinder and mark watson confirm this democratic dividend in a recent study .
their starting point is the observation that in the post-world war ii period ( from harry truman to barack obama ) , annual gdp growth has averaged 4.3 % during democratic administrations , compared to 2.5 % under republicans .
if one goes back further , to include herbert hoover and franklin d. roosevelt , the disparity is even larger .
the results are similar even if one assigns responsibility for the first three months – or the first few quarters – of a president ’s term to his predecessor .
terms in office have expired for the prosecutor-general , members of the national election commission , and supreme court justices , but no successors have been named , because maduro is unwilling to negotiate with the opposition and lacks the two-thirds majority in the national assembly needed to appoint officials of his choosing .
venezuelans would like nothing better than to be the ones who decide their own destiny , but the democratic means to do so are being denied to them .
indeed , one of the key opposition leaders , leopoldo lópez , has been arrested on ludicrous charges of “ inciting crime . ”
it would have been preposterous to tell ukrainian demonstrators facing government storm troopers to just grin and bear it without any external solidarity or support .
it is just as preposterous to tell venezuelan demonstrators the same thing .
true , far-left parties have also made advances since the post-crisis slump .
but history suggests that nationalists have the most to gain from episodes of political and social breakdown .
it is easy to see why .
classical socialism is the progeny of liberal internationalism , which is to say that it is a globalizing creed ; in principle , it knows no national frontiers .
yet in the face of large-scale economic crack-ups , internationalism becomes precisely the point at issue .
london – “ what if this is ‘ as good as it gets ’ ? ”
jack nicholson asks , as he walks through his psychiatrist ’s waiting room in the eponymous film .
at the recent meeting of g-20 finance ministers in shanghai , participants were asking much the same question – and not just with regard to medium-term expectations of weak global growth .
many are now wondering whether china ’s current growth rate will be as good as it gets for a long time to come .
determining the validity of such fears requires understanding what is driving china ’s economic slowdown .
the internet is also disseminating templates of what real democracy looks like – instantly and worldwide .
not surprisingly , people use this technology in ways that indicate that they have little interest in being cordoned off into conflicting and competing ethnicities , nationalities , or religious identities .
overwhelmingly , they want simple democracy and economic self-determination .
that agenda is in direct conflict with the interests of global capital and governments that have grown accustomed to operating without citizen oversight .
it is a conflict that can be expected to heighten dramatically in 2012 , as protesters ’ agendas – from occupy wall street to occupy moscow – gain further coherence .
but three of the european union ’s four largest economies – france , italy , and the united kingdom – all have large debts and annual deficits that point to even higher debt ratios in the future .
a rising level of national debt absorbs funds that would otherwise be available to finance productivity-enhancing business investment .
businesses now fear that the increasing deficits will lead to higher taxes , further discouraging investment .
that is a worrying prospect for everyone .
when interest rates rise , as surely they must , the cost of servicing the debt will require higher taxes , hurting economic incentives and weakening economic activity .
they pioneered new retail institutions , from department stores to box stores .
the fastest growing sectors of the economy since the late nineteenth century have been those loosely classified as “ service industries , ” often involving the dissemination of information and entertainment – activities in which jews have been especially prominent , from publishing to vaudeville and from movies to commercial sports .
they also tended to do disproportionately well in the learned professions – such as medicine , law , and accounting – that are so central to modern capitalist society .
the fact that jews were long a minority subject to discrimination is sometimes given as a reason for their tendency to devote themselves to commerce , finance , and the professions .
yet not all minorities long subject to discrimination necessarily succeed under conditions of market competition .
until now , sustainable infrastructure has been financed mostly by multilateral and national development banks ( mdbs and ndbs ) .
crowding in private capital will thus be key to closing the investment gap .
to help scale up the development and financing of sustainable infrastructure in low - and middle-income economies , we propose a new holistic framework developed by the one planet lab working group on financing sustainable infrastructure , of which one of us ( déséglise ) is a member .
the framework , called “ vision for an environmentally responsible transition – infrastructure ” ( vert-infra ) , aims to help unlock the pipeline of projects and develop sustainable infrastructure as an asset class , thereby opening the door to large-scale investments by institutional investors around the world .
vert-infra initially covers four sub-sectors of sustainable infrastructure : energy , energy storage , transport , and buildings , with a particular emphasis on projects in urban areas .
today , after the world financial and economic crisis ( and in contrast to 2001 ) , the us appears to be crucially weakened .
moreover , new superpowers with their own interests – namely , china and india – have come onto the international stage .
without the support of china and india , america ’s middle east policy can no longer succeed , but this support is only granted half-heartedly – if at all .
a success for american policy in this region holds very limited interest in beijing and new delhi , and europe is neither willing nor able to contribute substantial support .
in this tangled knot of regional wars , crises , and conflicts , iran ’s nuclear ambitions look like a ticking time bomb – and plenty of new dynamite is being accumulated throughout the region .
but this is no longer a us story .
creative destruction ( reinforced by economic openness and technology ) is sweeping the world .
skeptics keep arguing that competition and technology wreak havoc upon society 's harmony ; that they create inequality and eviscerate the middle class .
true , the new economy is tough for those who sit on their backsides and live at the expense of stockholders or taxpayers .
true , it gives a chance to energetic people formerly on the sidelines .
chest x-rays for lung cancer and pap tests for cervical cancer have received similar , albeit less definitive , criticism .
the next step in the reevaluation of cancer screening was taken last year , when researchers at the dartmouth institute for health policy announced that the costs of screening for breast cancer were often minimized , and that the benefits were much exaggerated .
indeed , even a mammogram ( almost 40 million are given annually in the us ) that detects a cancer does not necessarily save a life .
the dartmouth researchers found that , of the estimated 138,000 breast cancers detected annually in the us , the test did not help 120,000-134,000 of the afflicted women .
the cancers either were growing so slowly that they did not pose a problem , or they would have been treated successfully if discovered clinically later ( or they were so aggressive that little could be done ) .
this is important , as a rising population may be an even bigger problem than was previously thought .
a new study argues that there is now a 70 % chance that the world population will not peak this century , and an 80 % chance that it will reach 9.6-12.3 billion people by 2100 .
sub-saharan africa – persistently the poorest region – will be the main engine of demographic growth .
fortunately , there is a cost-effective way to slow down this engine : improve women ’s access to modern contraception .
providing contraception for the 215 million women worldwide – a large share of them in africa – who would like to avoid pregnancy would cost about $ 3.6 billion annually .
state-owned enterprises should also be free to bid , but they should receive no favors .
the fundamental problem in iraq is not jobs .
in contrast to the mexican , chinese , or russian revolutions , economic disenfranchisement is not driving the current conflict .
this is a struggle for power , not for economic justice or a better life .
the root causes are political , sectarian , and personal .
on russia since its invasion of georgia , obama and his running mate , joe biden ( who was the first member of congress to visit georgia after the invasion ) , emphasize helping georgia rebuild its economy and maintain its independence in the face of a continuing russian campaign against it .
mccain , on the other hand , wants to punish russia by such actions as expelling it from the g-8 .
such measures may ultimately be necessary , but they will not help georgia survive as an independent democracy .
moreover , even after the outrage in georgia , there are issues of common interest – such as energy , climate change , and iran – on which the west and the kremlin must cooperate .
this was true even during the cold war , and remains true today , yet mccain seems not to recognize it .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
central authority is gradually eroding as the country continues to splinter into ethnic and sectarian regions , with a de facto kurdish sovereign state already well established in the north .
meanwhile , in yemen , the possibility of adequate central authority is slipping away as the country confronts several seemingly intractable problems – from internal divisions and separatist movements to al qaeda ’s franchise in the arabian peninsula and a failing economy .
the south ( aden ) and east ( hadramaut ) are both on a trajectory toward independence , dragging yemen toward another secession struggle nearly 25 years after the country ’s fragile unification .
in libya , the collapse of colonel muammar el-qaddafi ’s regime has thrown the country into chaos and decimated central-government authority .
the south remains lawless , while the east is ruled by the benghazi regional council ; only the west remains subject to the poorly consolidated government in tripoli .
london – after the 2008 global financial crisis , a consensus emerged that the public sector had a responsibility to intervene to bail out systemically important banks and stimulate economic growth .
but that consensus proved short-lived , and soon the public sector ’s economic interventions came to be viewed as the main cause of the crisis , and thus needed to be reversed .
this turned out to be a grave mistake .
in europe , in particular , governments were lambasted for their high debts , even though private debt , not public borrowing , caused the collapse .
many were instructed to introduce austerity , rather than to stimulate growth with counter-cyclical policies .
we must fight exclusion from our political parties , just as we fight exclusion in our societies .
this means welcoming migrants and minorities , creating more opportunities for women and the disabled , and empowering citizens through education and participation .
empowering citizens means giving them both the power to decide and the knowledge to decide well .
in pasok , the greek socialist party that i lead , we are undertaking far-reaching reforms in this direction .
likewise , the goal of the socialist international is a world governed not by free markets , but by free people .
indeed , the euro could destroy the eu altogether .
in contrast to europe , the united states is emerging as the developed world ’s strongest economy .
shale energy has given the us an important competitive advantage in manufacturing in general and in petrochemicals in particular .
the banking and household sectors have made some progress in deleveraging .
quantitative easing has boosted asset values .
yet , by the mid '70s , when i first went to china during the cultural revolution , hardly a public surface was not emblazoned with the slogan : “ down with american imperialism and its running dogs . ”
even though the chinese felt incensed by foreign interference and domination , many also came to admire america for its democracy , openness , energy and willingness to help .
this divided attitude meant that china tended to react in ways as contradictory as they were impassioned and unpredictable , especially when its pride was piqued .
nothing was more repugnant to china 's new nationalists than the idea of a weak and aggrieved china victimized by foreign exploitation .
nothing provoked a more muscular reaction after mao came to power than the humiliating prospect of feeling unable to resist foreign predation .
third , we face steeply rising prices for fossil fuels , as developing countries ’ growth drives up demand and conventional supplies of coal , oil , and gas are depleted .
sure , we can find more fossil fuels , but at much higher cost and at much greater environmental risk from industrial spills , waste products , leaks , and other damage .
even the much-heralded shale-gas revolution is a lot of hype – similar to the gold rushes and stock bubbles of the past .
shale-gas wells deplete far more rapidly than conventional fields do .
and they are environmentally dirty to boot .
london – the united kingdom ’s general election is a little more than a month away , but already the campaign seems to have been with us forever , rolling implacably forward , but with little evidence of any genuine excitement – or even significant movement in the polls .
support for the two main contenders – the labour party and the ruling conservative party – seems stuck in the low-to-mid 30s .
the conservatives hope that the government ’s record on the economy will convince undecided voters to break in their favor late in the campaign .
maybe they are right ; they deserve to be .
in the meantime , labour seems to be hoping for who-knows-what to turn the tide , while keeping their collective fingers crossed that they will not be eviscerated in scotland , where the scottish national party is threatening to sweep the board .
is it really an american tradition not to care about what happens to others ?
the second insight from psychological research , summarized by bruce hood in his recent book the self illusion , relates to the role of consciousness in decision-making .
recent laboratory research shows that our conscious thoughts devise , ex post , compelling rationales for many decisions that our brains tend to make unconsciously .
for example , former us president george w. bush might have decided to invade iraq and topple saddam hussein for many reasons : strategic advantage , humanitarian concern , and even competition with his father .
most of them did not involve weapons of mass destruction .
other factors , in addition to trade policy , also matter , of course .
protection of property rights , civil and political liberties , protection from random violence are among other significant factors in promoting economic growth .
fiscal restraint as reflected by low government consumption relative to income growth is also important .
geographical location is also important , as such things as distance from markets , bad climates and poor soil hinder economic growth in developing countries .
but this makes implementing open trade policies all the more crucial , because they are the best tools available to compensate for the bad cards which nature sometimes deals out .
durham , north carolina – my day begins with a cup of coffee and ends with hot chocolate .
in between , i consume a variety of food and medicines , including my daily 81 mg dose of aspirin .
a brightly colored orchid enlivens my study , and , through the window , i catch a glimpse of my green garden .
in short , my life – like everyone ’s – is enabled , enriched , and extended by a wide variety of plants and their derivatives .
but the biodiversity on which all of us depend is under threat , as human activity devastates forests and other plant-rich habitats .
ramallah – israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu ’s decision to approve new jewish settlements on the eve of a possible settlement freeze is the latest round in a cycle that has been repeated so many times over the past 40 years that it would seem mundane if it were not so dangerous .
the cycle goes something like this : american or international pressure mounts on israel to stop settlement activities in the occupied territories .
israeli settlers and their supporters then gather even more energy to expand onto more palestinian land , build more exclusively jewish settlements , and destroy more arab homes before the so-called “ freeze ” comes into effect .
the peace process , not surprisingly , becomes a joke while this happens .
eventually , world pressure subsides and the freeze fails to materialize .
san francisco – there is a big difference between the federal reserve ’s mandate to maintain “ stable prices ” – as enunciated in the federal reserve act – and the fed ’s self-selected target of 2 % annual inflation .
so how is it that policymakers have managed to substitute the latter for the former ?
the term “ stable prices ” is self-explanatory : a bundle of goods will cost the same ten , 50 , or even 100 years from now .
by contrast , if a country experiences 2 % inflation over a ten-year period , the same items that $ 100 can buy today will cost $ 122 at the end of the decade .
after 100 years , the price tag will be a whopping $ 724 .
as a liberal myself , i share these values , but recognize that insisting on them as a matter of policy ultimately undermines migrants ’ interests .
with vehemently anti-immigrant political forces gaining ground throughout europe , one must ask whether the newcomers desperate for a job are better served by being admitted on a conditional basis ( including , potentially , for a limited period ) , or by not being admitted at all .
skills-biased immigration gives rise to a similar dilemma .
many in europe argue that this approach not only discriminates against the weakest groups of immigrants , but also leads to a brain drain from countries that need highly skilled workers .
but , again , one must examine the trade-off .
instead the reforms were decreed from high above , without having any grassroots support – and thus with no lasting durability .
all we had were direct appeals to the street and the masses rather than encouragement of a genuine social consensus .
such a direct method is the wellspring of authoritarianism .
we must recognize that and understand that it emerges not only when the public is apathetic or frightened , but also when there is no apparent stable advanced guard , such as powerful political parties , which choose the leaders and control them .
as a result russia now confronts a situation in which the election of the president is the only political issue .
likewise , greece ’s rate is 49.3 % , but its ratio is only 13 % .
and the eurozone-wide rate of 20.8 % far exceeds the 8.7 % ratio .
to be sure , a youth unemployment ratio of 13 % or 19 % is not grounds for complacency .
but , while the eurozone ’s youth unemployment rate has increased since 2009 , its ratio has remained the same ( though both significantly exceed pre-2008 levels ) .
during the 2006 french student protests , france ’s 22 % youth unemployment rate appeared to compare unfavorably to rates of 11 % , 12 % , and 13 % in the united kingdom , the us , and germany , respectively .
alternatively , china could eventually become a new supplier of reserve assets .
in this scenario , the supply of the reserve asset would align with the world ’s fast-growing regions .
this connection could be direct , if the renminbi acquires reserve-currency status ; or indirect , if the international monetary fund ’s unit of account , special drawing rights , becomes a favored asset of reserve managers , as the renminbi is now in the sdr currency basket .
reserve status for the sdr is a long-held imf ambition , though the idea has never gotten much traction .
but there is a third possibility : global demand for us reserve assets may subside .
trump has pledged to implement sweeping tax cuts , including a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 15 % .
add to that plans to subsidize infrastructure investment and increase military spending , and it seems likely that the us will face rapidly rising fiscal deficits and a huge short-term increase in demand .
with the us economy already operating at close to full capacity ( unemployment is below 5 % ) , higher imports – and a stronger us dollar – will be needed to meet that demand .
all of this will be good for the eurozone , for which the us remains a leading export market .
but it is the peripheral countries that are likely to benefit the most .
princeton – for the last century , economic-policy debate has been locked in orbit around the respective roles and virtues of the state and the market .
does the market control the state , in the sense that it sets a limit on governments ’ ability to borrow ?
or does the state take charge when the market fails to perform socially necessary functions – such as fighting wars or maintaining full employment ?
this old debate is at the core of today ’s profound divisions over how europe should respond to its debt crisis .
the same question is dividing american politics in the lead-up to november ’s presidential and congressional elections .
british negotiators will then respond to eu negotiators ’ domino-theory logic by trying to make the process as painful as possible for the rest of the eu .
indeed , the uk ’s “ leave ” constituency already firmly believes that the uk would be better off on its own , and that brexit will hurt europeans much more than it hurts britons .
this means that the leave camp has a powerful incentive to fulfill its own prophecy .
the second doom loop applies to the uk ’s domestic political economy .
britain can not simply start beating the europeans at their own game by reviving its automobile industry , or by making its own wine to rival french and italian producers .
the excessive domestic demand that underpinned this evolution is now gone , permanently .
when deleveraging in the household sector is complete , domestic expenditure may rebound , but the savings rate will not and should not go back to zero .
fiscal stimulus , in the form of backloading deficit-reduction efforts , might help tide the economy over while structural adjustment and expansion of competitiveness in the tradable sector proceed .
but , by itself , stimulus is not the answer .
otherwise , the shortfall in domestic demand would reassert itself when the stimulus ended .
so the us goal of regime change in baghdad does not look too bad , even if it can not be publicly supported .
for president putin it makes sense to stay on the sidelines over iraq , at least for now , and to be repaid later for his helpful silence in the form of us influence on the successor iraqi regime concerning repayment of the country 's russian debts .
if the us war in iraq fails , the situation will hardly be worse than it is now from the narrow point of view of russian interests , while the resulting mess will be a problem for the us and its traditional allies rather than for russia .
the contrast between russia 's handling of iraq and iran underlines not only mr putin 's famous pragmatism , but the sophistication and adroitness of his policy .
this contrast also reflects the fundamental difference between iran , an historical nation state , and the artificial creation that is iraq .
kosovo ’s skepticism about serbia ’s democratic credentials is derived , primarily , from knowing that conflict between kosovo and serbia is structural , not based on a single man .
no matter how much milosevic exacerbated tensions , his policies toward kosovo ’s ethnic albanians were genuinely popular among serbs .
indeed , throughout the decade of yugoslavia ’s wars , serbia ’s attitude toward its minorities reflected a nationalist consensus , in which the bulk of what was then the opposition participated .
most kosovars will find talking to serbia about improved relations difficult if serbia does not undergo some sort of “ de-nazification ” process .
president kostunica ’s refusal , so far , to even discuss putting internationally indicted war criminals on trial is not a hopeful omen here .
eventually , economic sanctions compelled qaddafi to distance himself from international terror and to turn over megrahi – as well as another suspect , lamin fhima , who was later acquitted – to face a scottish tribunal at camp zeist in holland .
but there was never any conclusive evidence that megrahi was involved in the lockerbie bombing .
in fact , most experts still believe that he was convicted using fraudulent evidence , and that the cia bribed witnesses .
furthermore , libya formally accepted responsibility for the bombing , agreeing to pay more than $ 2 billion to victims ’ families , and to abandon its weapons of mass destruction program .
yet , despite qaddafi ’s hope for a warmer embrace from western leaders ( and a flood of investment ) , the relationship remained plagued by mutual suspicion and frequent backsliding .
this experience motivated him to establish his dangote academy , a center for talent development that aims to help fill the industrial-skills gap in nigeria and beyond .
such initiatives are crucial to aligning education with economic development and enhanced prosperity .
by 2040 , africa will have 1.1 billion working-age citizens – more than either india or china .
with the right education , skills , and job opportunities , this immense workforce could deliver rapid and sustainable economic growth for the entire region .
without them , the continent is more likely to experience rising unemployment , widening inequality , social disorder , and , ultimately , conflict and chaos .
the husband of another young woman , aisha , cut off her nose and ears when she ran away .
violence against women in afghanistan persists for many reasons .
first , the country has inherited a patriarchal tribal tradition that assumes women ’s inferiority .
women are therefore deprived of their basic rights and freedoms .
second , there is a strong political incentive to deprive women of their rights .
but entering europe ’s economic and monetary union was meant to induce the political system to pursue longer-term goals such as productivity growth and enhanced competitiveness .
at first , events played out according to plan .
during the period of greece ’s accession to the eurozone , from 1994 to 2001 , its economy stabilized .
both inflation and the fiscal deficit fell rapidly ; businesses and consumers became more confident ; investment picked up ; and the government put in place an ambitious package of liberalizing reforms .
annual gdp growth jumped from -1.6 % in 1993 to over 4 % in 1997 – and stayed around this level until 2007 .
the european parliament , for its part , has already broadly supported such a move .
momentum toward an hfo phase-out in the arctic is building .
the danish shipowners ’ association and the arctic expedition cruise operator hurtigruten are just two of the players calling for tighter regulations or an outright ban .
other shipping companies have highlighted the need for regulations to maintain a level playing field .
in january 2017 , hurtigruten joined the clean arctic alliance to launch the arctic commitment .
john f. kennedy was a little of both .
he did one great thing : resolving the cuban missile crisis .
and his gift for motivating people was unmatched ; indeed , it outlasted him , with his assassination cementing a powerful legacy .
in africa , there has been no great figure since the death of south african president nelson mandela , who combined courage , authority , and magnanimity in graceful abundance .
in fact , he is among the most charismatic and charming leaders i have met ; the other two – former united nations secretary-general kofi annan and former us secretary of state colin powell – also are either african or african-american .
sanibel – the restoration of diplomatic relations between cuba and the united states unlocks new prospects for the island ’s economy .
some steps , including the removal of the us trade embargo , are prohibited by the helms-burton act , adopted by the us congress in 1996 .
but the renewal of cuba ’s membership in the international monetary fund is a real possibility .
cuba was one of the imf ’s 40 original members .
it was involved in much of the preliminary planning for the 1944 bretton woods conference , and had an active delegation there .
it goes without saying that academic or technical expertise is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure government officials ’ success .
indeed , many of my harvard colleagues would make terrible policymakers , owing to a lack of leadership , managerial , or other interpersonal skills .
and many excellent political leaders – for example , george washington and dwight eisenhower , among us presidents – have not been intellectuals .
technocrats can play a useful role as honest brokers when traditional politicians have become discredited or parties are deadlocked .
moreover , they have the credibility that comes with a lack of desire to be re-elected , either because their term in office has been limited in advance or because they are known to prefer a quiet academic life .
today , massive investments in critical infrastructure , industrial expansion , and urban development – vital to accommodate an expanding global population , set to reach nine billion by 2050 – are being made without adequate regard for disaster risk .
in the absence of a comprehensive effort to protect these new economic assets , disaster-related costs will skyrocket in the coming decades .
in this sense , climate-change forecasts should challenge politicians and business leaders to re-calibrate their perceptions of exposure and disaster risk .
decision-makers must recognize that there is no such thing as a natural disaster ; there is only the disastrous impact of natural hazards on infrastructure , including workplaces , homes , roads , schools , and hospitals .
following the 2004 indian ocean tsunami – which devastated the coastlines of 11 countries , resulting in more than 150,000 deaths , a half-million injuries , and over $ 10 billion in damages – 168 governments agreed to the hyogo framework for action ( hfa ) , a comprehensive ten-year plan for reducing disaster risk .
two years ago , scientists from the nature conservancy and its partners published new research showcasing nature-based solutions ’ potential to fight climate change .
yet natural climate solutions have continued to attract relatively little attention – and even less funding .
fortunately , this may be starting to change .
in september , nature-based solutions featured prominently at un climate week in new york city .
although that event did not live up to un secretary-general antónio guterres ’s call for “ clear steps to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020 , ” it did offer a platform to a new generation of climate and nature advocates .
just a few weeks ago , in fact , the administration was forced to admit that rouhani is fulfilling its part of the nuclear deal .
indeed , iranians ’ show of popular support for rouhani provides the best guarantee that the spirit behind the nuclear deal will remain unchanged .
but trump wo n’t make it easy for rouhani .
in order to ensure that iran continues progressing toward international engagement – thereby protecting a nuclear agreement that trump is not eager to defend – rouhani ’s government will have to work hard to improve relations with neighboring countries .
moreover , it will need to adopt a more constructive position vis-à-vis the syrian conflict , making it clear that iran is not spearheading a shia liberation movement .
ludicrous cases proceed , and more people are being dragged into them .
the mainstream independent media do not even report the inconsistencies for fear of provoking the government or the gülen network .
these cases will eventually collapse under the weight of their collective absurdity .
but the damage done will extend far beyond the suffering of hundreds of innocent individuals who have been locked up under false pretenses .
the hope that turkey is finally shedding its authoritarian vestiges and becoming a stable democracy will lie in tatters .
likewise , in july , the brics created a “ contingent reserve arrangement ” that would , it was claimed , “ forestall short-term balance of payments pressures , provide mutual support , and further strengthen financial stability . ”
but russia is unlikely to be able to draw upon this emergency credit line in the current crisis .
more recently , chinese foreign minister wang yi pledged assistance to russia .
but his vague language reflected a larger hesitation that will probably persist until the crisis is over .
in short , both the western-dominated governance mechanisms and the brics ’ fledgling institutions have turned against russia .
they will also try to lower japan ’s dependence on exports and rethink sending production facilities to lower-wage countries .
the economic impact of politics in the us , while important , will be less dynamic : absent a more cooperative congress , politics will mute policy responses rather than fuel greater activism .
continued congressional polarization would maintain policy uncertainty , confound debt and deficit negotiations , and impede economic growth .
from stymieing medium-term fiscal reforms to delaying needed overhauls of the labor and housing markets , congressional dysfunction would keep us economic performance below its capacity ; over time , it would also eat away at potential output .
in other countries , the causal direction will run primarily from economics to politics .
paris – the riots that have rampaged across greece may have many causes , but one that is rarely mentioned is the fracturing of the greek left into george papandreou ’s traditional socialist party , pasok , and an increasingly radicalized faction that refuses all accommodation with either the european union or modern economics .
to varying degrees , this divide is paralyzing socialist parties across europe .
that the traditional left is so inert in the midst of today ’s economic crisis is more than strange . instead of thriving on renewed doubts about capitalism , europe ’s socialist parties have failed to make any serious political inroads .
in countries where they hold power , such as spain , they are now very unpopular .
where they are in opposition , as in france and italy , they are in disarray – as are germany ’s social democrats , despite their being part of the ruling grand coalition .
the response to 9/11 and to dominique strauss-kahn ’s recent encounter with an african chambermaid in a new york hotel have very little in common , except for one thing : once again , cultural conflict was invoked in a misleading way .
whatever happened between the former managing director of the international monetary fund and his accuser , the fact that he was arrested and paraded in front of the press as a criminal suspect has been much criticized in france .
one allegation , made recently by a well-known french publicist , is that the arrest was typical of american puritanism .
the french , he alleged , being from a latin culture , have a more liberal understanding of sexual behavior .
they are more tolerant of human frailties , and have a more refined appreciation of the art of seduction .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
they have reason to be proud .
self-confidence among the governed and caution among the rulers : these are the psychological springs of democracy and true freedom , and they can never again be diverted in our homeland .
nobody ever doubted that ukraine had changed vastly in its twelve years of independence .
yet , caught in the sights of a gun barrel , nobody – not even the brave men and women who camped in their hundreds of thousands in the snow before ukraine ’s parliament – knew with certainty whether those changes had wrenched ukrainians from the grip of fear and apathy .
the success of their defiance shows the power of the idea that bewilders outgoing president leonid kuchma and his acolytes : that democracy means taking responsibility for one ’s fate into one ’s own hands .
israeli prime ministers are supposed to come in two varieties : heavily accented eastern european men and grizzled military officers who talk a good game before acquiescing to the latest american or international demands for concessions , talks , and aid .
while previous prime ministers like menachem begin and yitzhak shamir were not averse to lecturing , they lacked strategic cunning .
netanyahu ’s unwillingness to compromise disconcerts , confuses , and often enrages americans .
his relentless disquisitions on israel ’s strategic environment , security requirements , red lines , and jewish history are offset only by conciliatory talk about reopening negotiations , which are immediately reject by the palestinians , who , like him , fear showing weakness .
furthermore , netanyahu ’s unsentimental assessment of the middle east does not line up with that of the obama administration – in thrall to its collapsing romance with moderate islamists – and its devoted supporters among jewish americans .
followers are more likely to attribute charisma to leaders when they feel a strong need for change , often in the context of a personal , organizational , or social crisis .
for example , the british public did not regard winston churchill as a charismatic leader in 1939 , but , a year later , his vision , confidence , and communication skills gave him charisma , given britons ’ anxiety after the fall of france and the dunkirk evacuation .
and then , in 1945 , after the public ’s focus had turned from winning the war to constructing a welfare state , churchill was voted out of office .
his charisma did not predict defeat ; the change in followers ’ needs did .
in practice , charisma is a vague synonym for “ personal magnetism . ”
the government also secured eu-wide agreement that , rather than reducing the size of the european commission , ireland will be allowed to retain a permanent place at the commission table .
this negotiating success has provided the government with considerable breathing space in which to conduct a more effective referendum campaign .
this combination of legal guarantees and changed economic circumstances is helping to mobilize a majority in favor of the treaty .
opinion polls conducted in recent weeks indicate that the yes side commands a strong majority of 62 % to 23 % , with 15 % of the electorate undecided .
but the picture is far from clear-cut .
a decision to reject a merger or authorize an investment that benefits a politically motivated foreign competitor might make economic sense , while raising eyebrows in foreign-policy circles .
the solution is not to meddle with competition rules , but to give those in charge of security some say in the decision-making process .
to that end , in a forthcoming paper that i co-authored with foreign-policy experts and other economists , we propose that the eu high representative for foreign affairs and security be given the right to object on security grounds to the european commission ’s proposed mergers or investment decisions .
eu member states already have such procedures in place , and so should the eu .
finally , the eu must do more to develop its financial toolkit and promote international use of the euro .
a newly passed bill – clearly aimed at israeli arabs ’ representatives in the knesset ( parliament ) – would allow mks to be dismissed for disloyalty to the state .
ngos focused on human rights and peacemaking are scrutinized as foreign agents .
for israel , democracy has always been a strategic asset , because a democratic israel was a natural fit in the western alliance .
whereas the west lost no time in imposing sanctions on president vladimir putin ’s russia following its annexation of crimea , it has not punished israel ’s occupation of palestinian lands .
the more israel embraces putin-inspired practices , however , the weaker becomes its connection to its strategic rearguard in the west .
in kosovo restricting intervention to aerial bombardment made this strategy a total success : nato forces suffered not a single casualty in combat , but approximately 300 kosovar , 209 serb and 3 chinese civilians were killed .
this approach to the duties of a national leader , stated bluntly and honestly , forces us to consider a fundamental ethical issue .
to what extent should political leaders see their role narrowly , in terms of promoting the interests of their citizens , and to what extent should they be concerned with the welfare of people everywhere ?
mr romano prodi , president of the eu commission , and a former prime minister of italy , responded to president 's bush 's most recent statement by saying that “ if one wants to be a world leader , one must know how to look after the entire earth and not only american industry . ”
but the question is not only one for those who aspire to be world leaders .
on both of these fronts , the eu ’s lack of strategic vision has created the impression that europe is repeatedly being outmaneuvered by russian president vladimir putin .
it increasingly appears that ukraine is becoming locked in a “ frozen conflict ” – russia ’s foreign-policy specialty .
indeed , the situation in ukraine represents a tactical victory for russia , with the fragile but enduring ceasefire – and accompanying legislation that grants donetsk and luhansk considerable political autonomy – allowing russia to entrench the conflict near the eu ’s border .
moreover , the delayed implementation of key elements of the eu ’s association agreement with ukraine is clear evidence that , at the moment , russia dictates the terms of eu-ukrainian engagement .
in europe , the kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divide-and-rule strategy , particularly in view of hungary ’s decision to suspend gas flows to ukraine .
with the weak dollar hanging like the sword of damocles over the global economy , almost everyone laments america ’s spendthrift habits .
but did it ever occur to anybody how hard americans must work to make everyone else look good ?
thanks to america ’s gaping trade deficits , the biggest headache of every developing country finance minister nowadays is trying to keep his or her country ’s currency from going up too fast against the dollar .
when was the last time that happened ?
chronic debt-crisis countries from mexico to russia to south korea are all fighting off capital inflows from investors looking for an exit as the dollar collapses .
new york – hurricane harvey has left in its wake upended lives and enormous property damage , estimated by some at $ 150-180 billion .
but the rains that inundated the texas coast for the better part of a week , and the hurricane that is about to hit south florida , also raise deep questions about the united states ’ economic system and politics .
it is ironic , of course , that an event so related to climate change would occur in a state that is home to so many climate-change deniers – and where the economy depends so heavily on the fossil fuels that drive global warming .
of course , no particular climate event can be directly related to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
but scientists have long predicted that such increases would boost not only average temperatures , but also weather variability – and especially the occurrence of extreme events such as hurricane harvey .
rather than banding together , each new challenge has divided the eu into ever-smaller groups .
the euro has divided north and south ; ukraine and the refugee crisis have divided east and west .
pro-europeans need to engage with the sources of discontent and rethink the forms used to express the european ideal .
the eu was based on a mechanical idea that interdependence would reduce conflict .
by linking european means of production together – first through the european coal and steel community , and later through the common market and the euro – the eu hoped to bind europe ’s states together so closely that war between them would no longer be an option .
in nigeria today , the key question nowadays is not whether president olusegun obasanjo will quit after his second ( and final ) term expires next year , but who will succeed him .
given nigeria ’s history of sit-tight military dictatorships , that is real progress .
unfortunately , it is not necessarily the president ’s doing .
attempts by obasanjo ’s supporters to persuade the national assembly to amend the constitution to enable obasanjo to continue in office beyond two terms met a solid wall of opposition .
government and commercial activities virtually ground to halt this spring as democracy activists , in alliance with politicians and lawmakers opposed to a third term , battled obasanjo ’s allies to thwart the proposed bill .
parfit ’s response to this line of argument leads him to make a claim that is perhaps even bolder than his defense of objectivism in ethics .
he considers three leading theories about what we ought to do – one deriving from kant , one from the social-contract tradition of hobbes , locke , rousseau , and the contemporary philosophers john rawls and t.m. scanlon , and one from bentham ’s utilitarianism – and argues that the kantian and social-contract theories must be revised in order to be defensible .
then he argues that these revised theories coincide with a particular form of consequentialism , which is a theory in the same broad family as utilitarianism .
if parfit is right , there is much less disagreement between apparently conflicting moral theories than we all thought .
the defenders of each of these theories are , in parfit ’s vivid phrase , “ climbing the same mountain on different sides . ”
with the rise of the business corporation , large family firms have generally disappeared .
but that does not mean that a corporation is the right entity to engage in altruism – though its various stakeholders obviously can spend any portion of the income they earn from the corporation and other sources in altruistic ways .
instead of csr , we should have psr ( personal social responsibility ) .
one can also argue for psr on the grounds that asking for csr becomes a way of “ passing the buck ” – evading personal responsibility for doing good .
this is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee – both the subject of lawsuits in recent years .
tokyo – hillary clinton ’s recent trip to asia may one day be seen as the most significant visit to the region by a united states diplomat since henry kissinger ’s secret mission to beijing in july 1971 .
kissinger ’s mission triggered a diplomatic revolution .
renewal of us-chinese relations shifted the global balance of power at the cold war ’s height , and prepared the way for china to open its economy – the decision that , more than any other , has defined today ’s world .
what clinton did and said during her asian tour will mark either the end of the era that kissinger initiated four decades ago , or the start of a distinct new phase in that epoch .
clinton ’s tour produced the clearest signals yet that america is unwilling to accept china ’s push for regional hegemony .
chinese demand is not only growing , but , as incomes rise , its composition is shifting to more sophisticated goods and services .
thus , china ’s role is changing : once the west ’s low-cost supplier , it is now becoming a major customer for western products .
this represents a major opportunity for advanced economies to rebalance their growth and employment , provided that they are positioned to compete for the appropriate parts of evolving supply chains .
rising chinese incomes also imply structural change for china , as continued growth presupposes a shift to higher-value activities .
technology and knowledge will still be important , but china must begin generating new technologies , in addition to absorbing western tools and skills .
historically , french diplomacy excels at grand bargains .
but under merkel , germany has avoided such agreements , preferring the status quo or incremental changes , because it usually wound up paying extra .
for his part , macron ’s hyperactive diplomacy exposes a post-imperial inferiority complex , the symptoms of which – whether brexit or putinism – are impeding europe ’s normalization , and hampering the eu ’s mobilization to counterbalance china and the united states .
macron ’s rhetoric suggests that he wants to fight these symptoms .
but his recent actions seem to be reproducing them .
dublin – europe ’s needs and europeans ’ desires are at odds .
at a time when strong , coordinated action is needed to stave off financial collapse in the european union , the popular support that drove european integration over the last six decades is waning .
after almost 70 years of peace , europeans seem to have forgotten why unity was so important , indulging nationalist sentiment without regard for its potential consequences .
at the same time , they fail to grasp that their economies are too closely interconnected for independent economic policy to work .
this failure is rooted in electoral politics ’ confinement to individual countries , which forces politicians to pretend that they can address economic issues with national policies alone .
the skeptics have a point , but they go too far .
for one thing , it is still too early to judge the merits of the argument .
a full assessment of the iraq war and its effects on the middle east will take a decade or more .
clearly , the january 2005 election there was a positive step for the region .
in the last six months , there have been national elections in lebanon and local elections in saudi arabia .
in 1989 the region ’s peoples brought with them in their “ return to europe ” their diversity and richness ; their vivacity , mysteries , and memories ; and their old and new aspirations .
and they brought the lesson that moving from a closed society to an open one is both possible and extremely difficult .
as thomas mann once wrote : “ freedom is more complicated than power . ”
freedom changes the frame and substance of choice , and of individual and collective responsibility .
it highlights the contrast between initiative and apathy , enterprise and obedience , competition and total dependence on a state that embodies a kind of unshakable fate .
cambridge – major tax reform is high on the agenda for the united states in 2017 .
the republican-controlled house of representatives has been preparing for this for years , creating detailed plans for overhauling how corporate and personal income are taxed .
now , with a republican majority in the senate and a republican president in the white house , those plans can provide the basis for legislative action .
the proposed corporate tax reform is especially significant .
i believe it will have a highly favorable impact on business investment , raising productivity and overall economic growth .
this alliance between the two parties led to serious distortions of fundamental western values .
palme and oskar lafontaine , then one of the leaders of the opposition in germany , did not see the cold war as primarily a conflict between freedom and tyranny .
when palme visited east germany in 1984 he never criticized repression there , nor the berlin wall .
instead , palme praised east germany 's leader , erich honecker , underlining shared goals and the mutual struggle for peace and development .
palme 's main speech mentioned " détente , " " trust , " and " friendship , " but never " freedom " .
a different kind of revolution was taking place in europe ’s former colonies in asia , where native peoples had no desire to be ruled once more by western powers , which had been so ignominiously defeated by japan .
vietnamese , indonesians , filipinos , burmese , indians , and malays wanted their freedom , too .
these aspirations were often voiced in the united nations , founded in 1945 .
the un , like the dream of european unity , was also part of the 1945 consensus .
for a short while , many prominent people – albert einstein , for one – believed that only a world government would be able to ensure global peace .
guided by one of the architects of the problem , hank paulson , who had advocated for deregulation and allowing banks to take on even more leveraging , it was no surprise that the administration veered from one policy to another – each strategy supported with absolute conviction , until minutes before it was abandoned for another .
even if confidence really were all that mattered , the economy would have sunk .
moreover , what little action has been taken has been aimed at shoring up the financial system .
but the financial crisis is only one of several crises facing the country : the underlying macroeconomic problem has been made worse by the sinking fortunes of the bottom half of the population .
those who would spend do n’t have the money , and those with the money are n’t spending .
in the midst of a foreign-capital bonanza , stagnant levels of private investment in tradable goods are a particularly powerful danger signal that no amount of government mythmaking should be allowed to override .
officials face a simple choice : maintain strong prudential controls on capital flows , or be prepared to invest a large share of resources in self-insurance by accumulating large foreign reserves .
the deeper problem lies with the excessive financialization of the global economy that has occurred since the 1990 ’s .
the policy dilemmas that have resulted – rising inequality , greater volatility , reduced room to manage the real economy – will continue to preoccupy policymakers in the decades ahead .
it is true , but unhelpful , to say that governments have only themselves to blame for having recklessly rushed into this wild ride .
even a relatively small amount of material such as cobalt-60 – used in radiotherapy – could cause serious harm if combined with conventional explosives in a so-called dirty bomb ( or otherwise deliberately used to expose the public to dangerous radiation ) .
foreign and energy ministers will have an opportunity to strengthen the global nuclear security framework when they meet at the international conference on nuclear security : enhancing global efforts in vienna on july 1-5 .
this will be the first such event that is open to all countries .
at the top of the agenda should be ratification of improvements to a crucial nuclear security instrument – theconvention on the physical protection of nuclear material .
the proposed amendment would oblige countries to protect nuclear material when it is being used or stored , not just when it is being transported internationally , as is the case now .
this time , the initiative came from singh , who invited his pakistani counterpart , prime minister yousuf raza gilani , to visit mohali , near new delhi , to watch the two countries play the semi-final in the cricket world cup .
the match was played on march 30 , with pakistan losing narrowly .
on the political side , however , the two countries were not evenly matched .
of the troika that currently governs pakistan – the president , the prime minister , and the chief of staff of the army – it is the prime minister who carries the least amount of authority .
it was gilani who sat next to singh to watch the game ; but , ultimately , process , rather than protocol , will determine how bilateral relations move forward .
indonesia argues that a nation ’s right to control all information on locally discovered viruses should be protected through the same mechanisms that the united nations food and agriculture organization uses to guarantee poor countries ’ rights of ownership and patents on the seeds of its indigenous plants .
under the fao seed accord , a nation can register plants , share their seeds , and derive profits from resulting products .
this useful policy reduces exploitative practices that sometimes enable multinational corporations and wealthy governments to obtain outrageous profits from indigenous agriculture .
it is dangerous folly , however , to extend this policy to viruses .
if the concept of “ viral sovereignty ” had been applied to hiv 25 years ago , we would not have central repositories of thousands of varieties of hiv today ; these allow scientists to test drugs and vaccines against all the different strains of the virus that causes aids .
the new government ’s biggest challenge will be to implement reforms that enable italy ’s economic performance to catch up to that of its neighbors after years of bad policies and neglect .
this requires increased investment in innovation and human capital .
from 1992 to 2011 , labor productivity grew at an average annual rate of 0.9 % , the lowest in the oecd .
since 2001 , unit labor costs have been growing faster than real gdp and employment , undermining the economy ’s competitiveness vis-à-vis developing countries .
in the last decade , italy ’s share of global exports dropped from 3.9 % to 2.9 % .
but technical ability is not the only or even the main issue .
conflicting motivations are probably a more important reason why citizens increasingly distrust experts .
there is a misconception at work .
policy wonks think of themselves as unbiased purveyors of high-quality , evidence-based advice .
informed citizens reasonably fear that the wonk in question may be in thrall to a particular ideology or methodology ; that the advice may be politically motivated ; or that advisers may tailor their counsel to their own career concerns ( how to get that plum job on wall street after leaving government , for example ) .
whichever party combination comes out on top -- and helmut kohl 's coalition must still be regarded as the narrow favorite -- it will enjoy a meager majority , depending for any major initiative on the unlikely support of its political adversaries .
thus germany seems destined to be stuck in the doldrums for some time .
the price for inaction is considerable .
while exports are booming , unemployment remains stubbornly high .
disillusionment with politics is increasing and may even bring forth right-wing populists whom democratic germany has so far been spared .
europe ’s position as the world ’s largest trading bloc , with nearly 40 % of all international commerce , and the growing importance of the euro – crisis notwithstanding – as a reserve currency , mean that the eu , just as much as the us , can set the agenda for negotiating the new global rulebook .
the difference is that america acts decisively , and the eu does not .
of course , europe occupies the moral high ground that america has mostly vacated , owing to its mis-adventures in iraq and afghanistan .
europe ’s leadership on climate change and on development aid could , if well handled , be the basis for a new moral authority .
but there is little sign of governments taking advantage of this opportunity .
madrid – having secured a fifth term ( and his fourth in a row ) as israel ’s prime minister , binyamin netanyahu is on his way to surpassing david ben-gurion , the state ’s founding father , as his country ’s longest-serving leader .
yet netanyahu ’s israel would hardly be recognizable to ben-gurion , who strived to combine the country ’s jewish character with democracy .
as l.p. hartley wrote in the opening of the go-between : “ the past is a foreign country : they do things differently there . ”
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
in september 2008 , for example , former president roman herzog published a polemic entitled “ stop the ecj ! ”
he accused the luxembourg judges of grabbing ever-greater competences at the expense of the member states and urged the constitutional court to invalidate several controversial ecj rulings .
herzog ’s broadside resonated across europe , where for some time there has been considerable disquiet about “ judicial activism ” and what some see as an irreversible trend toward empowerment of the ecj and other eu institutions .
in many member states , the ecj ’s decisions have produced a backlash , especially on the left , with trade unions and social movements targeting the court ’s alleged zeal in siding with business over workers interests .
such arguments were deployed successfully during the 2005 referenda on the constitutional treaty in france and the netherlands , and in ireland during the referendum on the lisbon treaty .
at the same time , countries must facilitate workers ’ ability to change jobs through reforms to their labor markets and social safety nets .
this means shifting the focus from backward-looking labor-market policies , which seek to protect workers in existing jobs , to future-oriented measures , such as innovative insurance mechanisms and active labor-market policies .
moreover , social contracts based on formal long-term employer-employee relationships will need to be overhauled , with benefits such as retirement and health care made more portable and adapted to evolving work arrangements , including the expanding “ gig ” economy .
here , several proposals have already been put forward , including a universal basic income , currently being piloted in finland and some sub-national jurisdictions such as ontario , canada ; a negative income tax ; and various types of portable social security accounts that pool workers ’ benefits .
on both of these fronts , france is setting a positive example .
as brig. general robert caslen , the pentagon ’s deputy director for the war on terrorism , put it , “ we are not killing them faster than they are being created . ”
we are also failing in the application of soft power .
according to caslen , “ we in the pentagon are behind our adversaries in the use of communication – either to recruit or train . ”
the manner in which we use military power also affects rumsfeld ’s ratio .
in the aftermath of 9/11 , there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for america ’s military response against the taliban .
our study concludes that india can have faster economic and industrial growth , higher rates of energy consumption , and a cleaner environment .
but this is not what has happened so far .
air , soil , and water pollution has been growing , causing hundreds of thousands of deaths every year .
the key to a clean future is clean technologies , whose costs have been falling steadily , and will continue to do so .
sometimes these technologies pay for themselves and will be adopted .
the private sector also brings innovation to the classroom .
for example , some providers are developing teaching models in which students can watch teacher-created videos online outside of class , so that precious teacher-student face time can focus on interacting rather than lecturing .
similarly , skilled teachers can now deliver interactive e-lessons to many classrooms at once , even if they are hundreds of miles away .
as a result , students in places where schools have not yet been built , or too few qualified teachers are available , can still get an education .
after all , a lecture from a good teacher – even if it is broadcast over the internet – is preferable to face time with an untrained adult .
the obama administration has already moved against chinese exports of tires and steel pipes , but this year ’s confrontation will extend well beyond trade .
when congress takes up the debate over climate change , for example , and some lawmakers call for a cap-and-trade system , others will demand to know why america should accept binding commitments to limit emissions while the chinese refuse .
china ’s leaders , in no mood to play the scapegoat , will use surging national pride to bolster their position and strengthen their hand in negotiations .
the chinese government has invested heavily in recent years in state-owned companies and privately-owned “ national champions , ” mainly to ensure that china profits from the power of markets while the leadership controls as much of the spoils as possible .
to help these domestic powerhouses increase their market leverage , the government often favors them at the expense of foreign competitors .
but , faced with the possibility that today ’s low inflation may be caused by permanent supply shocks , they are also unwilling to ease more now .
so , even though central banks are n’t willing to give up on their formal 2 % inflation target , they are willing to prolong the timeline for achieving it , as they have already done time and again , effectively conceding that inflation may stay low for longer .
otherwise , they would need to sustain for much longer their unconventional monetary policies , including quantitative easing and negative policy rates – an approach with which most central banks ( with the possible exception of the bank of japan ) are not comfortable .
this central bank patience risks de-anchoring inflation expectations downward .
but continuing for much longer with unconventional monetary policies also carries the risk of undesirable asset-price inflation , excessive credit growth , and bubbles .
in order to achieve an agreement of similar scale and influence , world leaders – especially in the us and china – would need to be under similarly high pressure .
a global pact would have to be an urgent necessity , rather than an attractive possibility .
what would convince chinese leaders that they must rapidly reinforce the open global economy that enabled china ’s export-driven economic rise ?
one such catalyst might be a financial crisis emanating from the country ’s risk-laden shadow-banking system .
a contest for global leadership might serve that purpose as well .
winston churchill ’s famous denunciation of the delaying tactics of the british and french on the eve of world war ii should be a warning to french president nicolas sarkozy .
in fanning vicious anti-immigrant passions for short-term political gain , he will have dishonor first and then defeat .
for , although a majority of french today may be inclined to sympathize with sarkozy ’s immigrant-bashing rhetoric , there is no guarantee that they will re-elect him in 2012 .
it is not so much sarkozy ’s performance as president that most frenchmen reject ; it is his essence .
at a time of rising unemployment , with france dominated by fears about the future , the french need a reassuring father or mother figure , not a jittery and manipulative leaderready to compromise ethics and france ’s proud tradition that every citizen is entitled to equal treatment under the law .
millions end up in protracted displacement , spending an estimated 25 years , on average , stuck in limbo , unsure when they might return home .
in 2016 , developed countries should agree to accept a combined total approaching a million refugees annually , either through resettlement or by issuing humanitarian , student , labor , and other visas .
with canada alone saying that it will resettle 50,000 syrian refugees this year , it is clear that this target is achievable .
at the same time , the international community must support the integration of refugees in major host countries like turkey , kenya , lebanon , and jordan .
as it stands , such countries receive just a fraction of the $ 3,000-5,000 per refugee required annually to provide adequate housing , food , health care , schooling , and job training during the first few years of displacement .
berkeley – inequality is on the public ’s mind almost everywhere nowadays .
indeed , in the world ’s two largest democracies , india and the united states , widespread popular movements against rising inequality and elite greed are becoming highly salient issues in looming national elections .
yet , in both countries , some social inequalities have been on the decline over the last few decades .
in india , certain historically disadvantaged groups ( particularly among the lower castes ) are now politically assertive .
the most egregious vestiges of caste discrimination are gradually disappearing .
but unemployment continues to rise in the heavily indebted southern countries , and output continues to lag behind germany and other northern european countries .
the main reason for the lag is not simply low demand or large debts .
there is a vast difference between unit labor costs – real wages adjusted for productivity – in germany and in the heavily indebted southern countries .
when the crisis began , production costs in greece were about 30 % higher than in germany , so greece exported very little and imported very much .
production costs in other heavily indebted countries were 20-25 % higher than in germany .
most important , despite the russian army massed against us , we are embarking on an election campaign .
next month , ukraine ’s citizens will freely choose a new president – the best rebuke possible to russian propaganda about our supposed failure to uphold democracy .
and yet , as ukrainians work to rebuild our country after viktor yanukovych ’s predatory rule , we are facing a new threat , in the form of a “ peace offensive ” – that old staple of soviet diplomacy designed to undermine western resolve .
russian president vladimir putin ’s recent phone call to us president barack obama to seek renewed diplomatic talks , followed by a russian white paper on how to resolve a crisis of the kremlin ’s making , is in fact a peace offensive that is offensive to peace .
putin ’s gambit is akin to the infamous yalta conference in 1945 , where joseph stalin made winston churchill and franklin d. roosevelt complicit in a division of europe that enslaved half of the continent for almost a half-century .
in 1973 , dimona ’s defenders downed a wayward libyan civilian airliner heading for the reactor , killing 108 people .
but the 1991 persian gulf war upset whatever solace israel could take from the past .
iraqi scud missiles bombarded tel aviv , and one came close to hitting dimona .
hezbollah ’s bombardment of northern israel in 2006 , further demonstrated the country ’s vulnerability to missile attack .
and , while israel ’s arrow ballistic missile defenses , which now surround dimona , may be superior to the patriot system that failed in 1991 , syria ’s more advanced scuds and iran ’s shahab 3 rocket present a more capable challenge than saddam ’s projectiles .
moreover , the ability of the financial authorities to stimulate the economy is constrained by the unwillingness of the rest of the world to accumulate additional dollar reserves .
until recently , investors hoped that the us federal reserve would do whatever it takes to avoid a recession , because that is what it did on previous occasions .
now , they must recognize that the fed may no longer be in a position to do so .
with oil , food and other commodities firm , and the renminbi appreciating somewhat faster , the fed also has to worry about inflation .
if interest rates were lowered beyond a certain point , the dollar would come under renewed pressure and long-term bonds would actually go up in yield .
and , when she does marry and has children of her own , they will benefit from two educated , employed parents , which means twice as much literate conversation in the home , twice the contacts , and twice the encouragement to succeed .
educated , pushy mothers make all the difference .
as us secretary of state hillary clinton put it in the newsweek issue , “ the world needs to think more strategically and creatively about tapping into women ’s potential for growth .
studies show that helping women access trade and grow businesses helps create jobs and boost incomes . ”
but on planet worst , forcing terrified , uneducated women to remain at home is more socially acceptable than facing the fact that this means choosing to drag down incomes for everyone .
one of the factors driving the uk ’s sense of unease in its relations with an increasingly bureaucratized europe is the belief that its values and institutions are closer to those of the us , or of other english-speaking former colonies .
by the 1990 ’s , british euro-skeptics coined the term “ anglosphere ” to describe a model that was more successful and more expansionary than that of the eu .
the us has been the “ other woman ” undermining britain ’s loyalty to the eu as an attractive permanent partner .
as a result , britain has lost much of its ability to make an effective contribution to european reform .
indeed , the last time britain had a strong european voice was more than two decades ago .
but the battle between pro- and anti-europeans is masking what really is at stake – and thus what should be the focus of electoral debate : how europe can generate sustained economic growth .
this question , rather than an endless defense against euroskepticism , should be the main item of deliberation for parties pushing for an improved europe for all .
broad-based recovery – in investment , demand , and employment – is the best weapon with which to confront those who would destroy the european project .
the upcoming election will render the public ’s judgment on the success or failure of the austerity policies that have been undertaken .
but it will also determine whether europe will be able to remain the world ’s leading economic power , maintain its social model , and safeguard its framework of rights and liberties in a world that will not wait for europeans to resolve their differences .
then there is the concept of systemic risk , which is not only in the eye of the beholder but may be impossible to predict .
the mexican crisis of 1994-1995 was seen as a systemic risk from washington , but not from most european capitals .
americans thought the europeans parochial ; they thought the us unduly influenced by its 2000 mile border with mexico .
everyone agrees that ecuador posed no systemic risk ( though it was an emergency ! ) , but what about brazil ?
and who before july 1998 thought that a russian default would trigger global financial panic ?
the eurozone ’s southern european members must reduce their wage costs to claw back the competitiveness that they have lost since adopting the common currency .
concern about such divergences has also reached the task force headed by european union president herman van rompuy , which is supposed to devise fundamental reforms to the rules for economic policy coordination within the eu .
a key proposal from the task force ’s first meeting was to develop competitiveness indicators , and then force member countries to take “ remedial action ” should the eu find large divergences .
but this approach risks leading in the wrong direction .
competitiveness , which is usually measured in terms of unit labor costs , is a relative concept .
mexico city – during the spanish civil war , thousands of young americans went to spain to join the fight against fascism as part of the “ abraham lincoln brigade . ”
today , as more people wake up to the threat that us president donald trump poses to the rule of law , human rights , and international order , a new global resistance movement is emerging to defend democracy and basic decency .
the resistance could adopt three tactics .
one approach is simply to wait and hope that trump is turned into a lame duck by damning revelations about his administration .
better yet , trump could be impeached or removed from office under the 25th amendment of the us constitution , if enough members of his own government deem him incapable of carrying out the duties of the presidency .
no single measure would do more to make the world a less dangerous place than a substantial reduction in its consumption of oil .
and no single measure would do more to reduce global oil consumption than a sharp increase in the tax on gasoline in the country that consumes more of it than any other : the us .
if americans had to pay more for gasoline , they would use less of it . with a high gasoline price , alternative sources of energy such as ethanol and alternative forms of transportation such as electrically powered automobiles would become commercially viable .
none of this would happen immediately .
in the short term , americans would have to make modest economic sacrifices in the form of higher fuel prices .
new york – internet firms are supposed to be all about the cutting edge , but reality and buzz sometimes conflict .
consider groupon : its focus is the power of groups , but its actual business is the old standby of direct-mail marketing and coupons .
but groupon is spreading that model to a much wider audience – not so much to coupon users , but instead to merchants offering coupons .
in fact , groupon is doing for e-mail marketing what other internet companies are doing for the yellow pages or classified ads : encouraging merchants to use modern technology to reach their customers .
the model clearly makes sense for a lot of customers : groupon now has more than 50 million subscribers and aims for 150 million by year-end .
the prevailing view is that the downward trend largely reflects a fall in equilibrium or “ natural ” interest rates , driven by changes in saving and investment fundamentals .
in other words , a higher propensity to save in emerging economies , together with investors ’ growing preference for safe assets , has increased the supply of saving worldwide , even as weak growth prospects and heightened uncertainty in advanced economies have depressed investment demand .
this perceived decline in “ natural ” interest rates is viewed as a key obstacle to economic recovery , because it impedes monetary policy ’s capacity to provide sufficient stimulus by pushing real rates below the equilibrium level , owing to the zero lower bound on nominal rates .
how to stem the decline in equilibrium rates has thus become the subject of lively debate .
conspicuously absent from the debate , however , is the role of financial factors in explaining the trend decline in real rates .
as enrico moretti of the university of california at berkeley emphasized in his book the new geography of jobs , the salience of this new divide is unmistakable : university graduates account for half of the total population in the most affluent us metropolitan areas , but are four times less numerous in worse-off areas .
economic shocks tend to exacerbate this political divide .
those who happen to live and work in traditional manufacturing districts caught in the turmoil of globalization are multiple losers : their jobs , their housing wealth , and the fortunes of their children and relatives are all highly correlated .
in fascinating new research , mit ’s david autor and his co-authors have explored the political consequences .
they find that us districts where the economy was severely hit by chinese exports have responded by replacing moderate representatives with more radical politicians – either from the left or the right .
the un commission of inquiry has collected information identifying some of those responsible for the crimes it has investigated , but it has not made it public .
the names of those responsible should be disclosed , either by the commission , or by another body created by the un human rights council .
those to be named should be notified and given a chance to refute the findings .
if they fail to respond , or if their responses are not persuasive , their names and the crimes attributed to them should be made public .
the human rights council could act on its own .
the scars of colonialism are fresher in france than anywhere else in europe ; the country has europe ’s largest muslim minority ; and , with moderates seeming particularly weak and divided , the extreme right is cresting in opinion polls .
these ingredients could constitute a recipe for disaster .
already , le pen appears to be reverting to form .
“ national unity is a pathetic political maneuver , ” she complained , after she was not invited to a rally the day after the attack .
but , if the right leaders are at the helm , the january 7 attack could spur a renewed sense of collective purpose and political revival .
that means increasing capital and human capital intensity across both the tradable and non-tradable sectors of the economy .
on the tradable side , one should look for structural change and a shift in output to higher-value-added components of global supply chains .
here , innovation and the conditions that support it – including competition and free entry and exit from the market – play an important role .
if policymakers choose a model based on a large state-dominated sector protected from internal and external competition , innovation objectives are unlikely to be met , adversely affecting future growth .
meanwhile , the non-tradable side should grow .
of course , elections alone do not a democracy make .
consider those cases when elections empower a majority ethnic or religious group , which then rides roughshod over minorities – an outcome that has been seen all too often in the balkans , for example .
then there are the cases when the election of a leader is treated as if it somehow legitimizes the subsequent emergence of dictatorship .
this has been the case in russia , which , since president vladimir putin ’s first electoral victory in 2000 , has become a potemkin democracy .
this year , another election , neither free nor fair , will give putin another term in office .
but the iranians are nothing like the nazis , and there is no country like the soviet union posing the kind of threat that inspired us president richard nixon to head to beijing in 1972 .
equally problematic has been the tendency to compare the two sets of negotiations to each other .
beyond timing , they have little in common .
what they do share is that their “ success ” was driven largely by the sense that powerful external threats made the alternative – no deal at all – much worse .
in greece ’s case , negotiations were propelled by the specter of an embittered greece cozying up to russian president vladimir putin , with his dangerous revisionist ambitions , or acting as a conduit for europe-bound migrants .
what if that advantage comes from using a performance enhancing drug ?
for athletes who want to compete clean , the threat that they may be beaten by a competitor who is not faster , stronger , or more dedicated , but who takes a drug to gain the edge , is profoundly personal .
when drugs are prohibited but some athletes use them anyway the playing field tilts in favor of the cheater .
if we prohibit drugs in the olympic games , we owe it to the athletes to deter , detect , and punish those who cheat .
integrity seems like an old-fashioned idea , but it is at the heart of who we are and how we live .
external forces , meanwhile , compounded the problem .
south korea ’s admission to the oecd required its government to dismantle capital controls , exposing the economy to inflows of short-term “ hot money . ”
more generally , countries felt pressure from the imf and the us treasury to remove capital-flow restrictions , which magnified the risks and made maintaining pegged exchange rates still more problematic .
this sketch of the crisis highlights how much has changed over the subsequent 20 years .
for starters , the crisis countries have ratcheted down their investment rates and growth expectations to sustainable levels .
beyond this , the dollar is n’t going anywhere .
it is not about to be replaced by the euro or the yen , given that both europe and japan have serious economic problems of their own .
the renminbi is coming , but not before 2020 , by which time shanghai will have become a first-class international financial center .
and , even then , the renminbi will presumably share the international stage with the dollar , not replace it .
the one thing that could precipitate the demise of the dollar would be reckless economic mismanagement in the us .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
i and a number of other wealthy americans are contributing millions of dollars to grass-roots organizations engaged in the 2004 presidential election .
we are deeply concerned with the direction in which the bush administration is taking the united states and the world .
if americans reject the president 's policies at the polls , america can write off the bush doctrine as a temporary aberration and resume its rightful place in the world .
if american voters endorse those policies , the us shall have to live with the hostility of the world and endure a vicious cycle of escalating violence .
in this effort , i have committed $ 10 million to ' america coming together , ( act ) ' a grass-roots get-out-the-vote operation , and $ 2.5 million to the 'moveon.org voter fund , ' a popular internet advocacy group that is airing advertisements to highlight the administration 's misdeeds .
while russia has not overtaken the us , 20 % of respondents cited the country as their “ best friend ” outside the middle east and north africa .
but russia is likely to disappoint its fans in the middle east , not least as a regional peace broker .
after america ’s peace negotiations with the afghan taliban failed – and nearly 30 years after the end of the decade-long soviet occupation of the country – the kremlin stepped in to mediate discussions between the taliban and representatives of other afghan groups .
yet the middle east – a region of manifold conflicts stemming from religious , ethnic , political , historical , and strategic factors – has time and again exhausted foreign actors ’ commitment .
there is little reason to think that russia , which has never been particularly inclined toward long-term peace-building , will be able to mediate , let alone underwrite , durable peace agreements .
but experience shows that the decision to retire or to work fewer hours is influenced by the compensation that members of this group receive .
and this amount partly reflects the fact that employed people who collect social security and medicare are subject to the payroll tax that finances them .
the payroll tax paid by employees is 6.65 % ( employers pay the same rate ) , and is in addition to the personal income tax .
moreover , because of the complex rules that govern the level of social security benefits , the older worker who pays this payroll tax is likely to receive no extra benefits .
for many older workers , the choice is not whether to work , but how much .
eu enlargement will bring enormous impetus to the whole of europe , particularly the baltic region from which so many new eu members will come .
up to now , eu interest in kaliningrad has centered on how to restrict the visa rights that the oblast 's citizens now use to traverse poland and the baltic states so as to visit the rest of russia .
eu expansion , however , will increase trade and economic growth , and these could provide real incentives to make kaliningrad a more attractive neighbor and trading partner , not just a feared source of illegal russian immigrants to the eu taking advantage of a supposedly lax visa regime .
however , if this fails , the contrasts between kaliningrad and the rest of the region will be shamefully striking .
the eu must forge close cooperation with russia 's leaders and the kaliningrad oblast in designing a viable future for the enclave .
without nuclear fusion , future generations ’ energy options will be severely limited – creating a serious problem for developed and developing countries alike .
lev artsimovich , the tokamak ’s inventor , said that “ fusion will be ready when society needs it . ”
one hopes that he is right .
but , rather than depending on fusion researchers to defy the odds , the world should step up investment in the technology .
our future may depend on it .
would the imf not have insisted on a much tougher program , with less financing , for any country outside the eurozone ?
the apparent explanation for the imf ’s extraordinary gamble is that the managing director who made the decision to support greece so heavily hailed from the eurozone and , at the time , was barely disguising his ambitions to run for the french presidency – that is , before his arrest in new york on charges of rape .
europeans , moreover , dominate the fund ’s leadership .
it is a discomforting conflict of interest that debtors dominate an international institution that lends them vast sums .
this mismanagement should disqualify any eurozone policymaker from the imf ’s managing directorship , and yet christine lagarde , french finance minister , was named to succeed her compatriot dominique strauss-kahn after his resignation .
so the three problems that europe will face in the second half of this year are closely connected .
the eu will need the strongest leadership team that it can find to steer through treacherous waters and implement crucial financial reforms .
just now , the signs are far from promising .
there are few new faces or ideas on the horizon .
we must hope to be surprised .
a more nuanced approach would focus on eliminating the underlying , interconnected barriers that women face in getting nominated for elected office and conducting successful campaigns .
such obstacles include the election system itself ( women fare better under proportional representation than they do in first-past-the-post systems based on single-member districts ) ; lack of access to financing ; weaker professional networks ; and outside responsibilities that make it harder to take on punishing and unpredictable working conditions .
overcoming such structural barriers requires a comprehensive strategy for supporting women candidates .
one of the most powerful tools is money .
in many countries , the cost of campaigning is becoming prohibitively high for most aspirants , regardless of gender .
this reflects both a public-investment deficiency and an information gap : investing in job training in a rapidly evolving industrial structure is like shooting at a moving target .
given imperfect information about future needs , labor markets are out of equilibrium .
powerful technological and global market forces are not confined to any single country .
the same issues are arising everywhere , with differences in outcomes reflecting variability in market flexibility and social-policy choices .
these adverse trends date back to about 1980 .
wikipedia ’s boosters trumpet it as heralding the arrival of “ web 2.0 . ”
whereas “ web 1.0 ” facilitated the storage and transmission of vast amounts of different kinds of information in cyberspace , “ web 2.0 ” supposedly renders the whole process interactive , removing the final frontier separating the transmitter and receiver of information .
but we have been here before – in fact , for most of human history .
the sharp divide between producers and consumers of knowledge began only about 300 years ago , when book printers secured royal protection for their trade in the face of piracy in a rapidly expanding literary market .
the legacy of their success , copyright law , continues to impede attempts to render cyberspace a free marketplace of ideas .
that is somewhat ironic : removing the uk from the ecj ’s jurisdiction is now one of may ’s principal aims .
so delegation after delegation of ministers , mayors , and assorted financial center lobbyists have been filling london ’s best hotels and providing a welcome boost to the high-end restaurant trade .
luxembourg , frankfurt , dublin , and others have been making glossy presentations about their cities ’ competitive advantages over london : lower property costs , lower corporate tax rates ( that sounds plausible when claimed with an irish accent ) , michelin-starred restaurants , and porsche dealerships – all the essential services that make up a vibrant financial center .
some of these presentations have raised a wry smile or two .
french president françois hollande was elected on a claim that the world of high finance was his enemy .
that reasoning has led iran ’s leaders to dial up its disruptive activities in a number of theaters , not least by seizing a british tanker in the strait of hormuz last month ( they , too , have noticed that the uk is europe ’s weak link ) .
iran ’s increasing aggressiveness has already raised hackles in israel , which is reportedly targeting iranian assets in iraq ( having already launched strikes against iranian forces in syria ) .
the danger now is that iran or its proxies in the middle east will misread the situation and cross a red line .
iran has been understandably frustrated by europe ’s slow progress in launching instex , a bartering mechanism designed to allow for some trade between europe and iran despite us sanctions .
but those in iran who claim they have gotten nothing from europe are simply wrong .
so managers are quick to embrace " aggressive " or " creative " accounting methods that flatters earnings projections , conceals risks , and portrays a smooth record of profit growth .
finally , managers , not distant shareholders , control access to well-paid appointments and lucrative consulting jobs .
so internal and external auditors are often co-opted .
to be sure , the us corporate and securities scandals exposed regulatory gaps-insufficient enforcement of disclosure requirements , for example , or excessive reliance on peer review for auditors and on so-called " chinese walls " to keep brokerage and investment-banking activities separate .
moreover , us accounting standards have been unable to cope with bookkeeping 's uncharted frontiers of off-balance sheet transactions , structured financing methods , and byzantine contract valuations .
countries in asia – indeed , countries throughout the developing world – are simply not exporting their abundant and economically important genetic resources .
the convention on biological diversity ( cbd ) , signed in 1992 , promised an international regime on access and benefit sharing ( abs ) of genetic resources .
this would allow researchers and companies access to the developing world ’s genetic treasure trove in return for a share of the profits from the products that are then developed .
but brokering the abs regime has proven elusive , and , in the absence of an international deal , there has been diminishing access and thus declining benefit-sharing over the past five or so years .
this implies potentially huge economic , environmental , and social losses to both the developed and developing world .
the benefits of economic growth will be less unequally distributed than in the past few years , though they will still accrue disproportionately to those who are already better off .
the second group , led by china , will stabilize at lower growth rates than recent historical averages , while continuing to mature structurally .
they will gradually reorient their growth models to make them more sustainable – an effort that occasional bouts of global financial-market instability will shake , but not derail .
and they will work to deepen their internal markets , improve regulatory frameworks , empower the private sector , and expand the scope of market-based economic management .
the third group , led by europe , will struggle , as continued economic stagnation fuels social and political disenchantment in some countries and complicates regional policy decisions .
once again , european companies have borne the costs of these measures .
and because european firms are so heavily integrated with the us economy , europe has struggled to maintain an autonomous foreign policy toward iran .
unless the euro can be made into an international currency to rival the dollar , the european economy will remain highly vulnerable to us extraterritoriality .
a third area of soft-power weaponization has been technology , particularly with respect to 5g .
unlike 3g and 4g broadband systems , 5g deployment has far-reaching security and geopolitical implications , because it promises not only to improve mobile telephony , but also to accelerate the development of the internet of things and the digitalization of entire economies .
so what accounts for the partisan performance gap ?
blinder and watson suggest that five factors – oil shocks , productivity growth , defense spending , foreign economic growth , and consumer confidence – may together explain 56 % of the growth gap .
but it is impossible to know the extent to which these factors were influenced by the us president ’s policies .
we know even less about the factors responsible for the other 44 % of the performance gap .
in assessing clinton ’s statements on this topic , the fact-checkers make much of the finding by blinder and watson that , contrary to widespread assumptions , fiscal and monetary policies are not more “ pro-growth ” or expansionary under democrats than under republican presidents , and therefore can not explain the performance differential .
but , with myanmar included , this may be too difficult politically , and an asean sub-grouping may be more realistic .
another option is for the us to press for a trans-pacific partnership .
this was proposed late in the bush administration in order to forge links with some asean members – singapore , vietnam , and brunei – as well as others across the pacific .
this could be built up to include other open southeast asian economies – malaysia and thailand – with the eventual aim being an apec-wide agreement , which would be an impressive achievement if realized by the end of 2011 , when it will be obama ’s turn to play host to all the leaders .
in this time of crisis and unemployment , the american public may question freer trade .
the trouble is that few outsiders seem to be listening , much less preparing to confront the eventual limits of central-bank effectiveness .
as a result , they risk aggravating the potential challenges .
this is particularly true of those policymaking entities that possess much better tools for addressing advanced economies ’ growth and employment problems .
rather than use the opportunity provided by central banks ’ unconventional monetary policies to respond effectively , too many of them have slipped into an essentially dormant mode of inaction and denial .
in the united states , for the fifth year in a row , congress has yet to pass a full-fledged budget , let alone dealt with the economy ’s growth and employment headwinds .
meanwhile , only 15 % of private-sector employees – people who presumably rely on government-funded education and infrastructure – receive the type of fixed-benefit retirement plan that will cushion ryan ’s retirement , according to the pension rights center .
to restore fairness , the government should follow the private sector ’s lead and link politicians ’ pensions to their performance .
like high-level managers at publicly traded private companies , policymakers who made bad decisions should face clawbacks , in the form of reduced pensions .
a pension is a long-term commitment from the state – and , ultimately , the taxpayer – to an individual politician .
if politicians are receiving pensions starting at age 50 , as ryan will , retirement benefits could realistically be paid out for 40-plus years .
abbas ’ presidential term has expired , and elections are constantly being postponed .
the pa prime minister , salam fayyad , like his hamas counterparts in gaza , rules by decree , keeps parliament inactive , and silences the opposition .
with no institutionalized democratic legitimacy , the pa is bound to rely on its security forces and on those of the occupier , israel , to enforce its will .
of course , throughout history , national liberation movements have had to marginalize their own radicals and fanatics in order to reach the promised land .
this was true of zionism , of the italian risorgimento , and most recently of the catholics in northern ireland .
the commander of the guantánamo task force , rear admiral harry b. harris , jr. , recently defended harsh treatment of his prisoners , claiming , “ they ’re all terrorists ; they ’re all enemy combatants . ”
but the cia has made mistakes before .
for example , murat kurnaz , a german-born turkish man , was held in guantánamo for four years before being released last august .
the case of khaled el-masri , a german citizen of lebanese descent , appears to be another of these errors .
seized by the cia in macedonia , he was taken to afghanistan and interrogated for five months before being released without charge .
the treaty calls for a new eu foreign minister – although he is formally denied that title , this is what everyone will call him – with a strong administrative infrastructure in the european commission and the council .
the rotating presidency will be replaced by an elected president of the council .
a new balance will be struck between the eu and member states , and a stronger role will be given to the european parliament and the national parliaments .
eu citizens will be endowed with legally binding fundamental rights , and majority decisions will become the general norm .
a high price had to be paid for this agreement .
we must hope that the government can answer that question .
the most interesting parts of “ future of finance ” concern how means of payment are changing .
cash is in decline in many countries , though the rate differs markedly from place to place .
cash usage has fallen by over 80 % in sweden in the last decade and is now dropping by 10 % per year in the uk , while it is barely changing in germany .
van steenis warns that the “ swedish experience shows that without a coordinated plan , the pace of change risks excluding some groups in society . ”
the second reason to avoid imf intervention in europe is that lending to a potentially insolvent country has serious implications for the fund .
for starters , taking the imf ’s preferred-creditor status at face value , an imf loan would entail substituting its “ non-defaultable ” debt for “ defaultable ” debt with private bondholders , because the fund ’s money is used primarily to service outstanding bonds .
as a result , a group of lucky bondholders would be bailed out at the expense of those that became junior to imf debt and remained highly exposed to a likely restructuring .
since a “ haircut ” can be imposed only on whatever is left of the defaultable private debt , the larger the imf share , the deeper the haircut needed to restore sustainability .
for the same reason , imf loans can be a burdensome legacy from a market perspective .
beijing – consider this : despite china ’s swelling foreign-exchange reserves – the result of persistent current-account surpluses – market and interbank short-term interest rates are soaring .
how did this happen , and what should policymakers do about it ?
the problem is , at root , structural .
china ’s monetary stock is relatively abundant .
as the world ’s largest currency issuer , china ’s broad money supply ( m2 ) is 1.5 times larger than that of the united states , with an m2/gdp ratio of about 200 % , compared to about 80 % in the us .
while institutions such as weill cornell in qatar and the gulf university of science and technology in kuwait have launched innovative research and training programs that focus on these types of health challenges , much more is needed .
another problem is that the region ’s education and training programs do not encourage enough systemic thinking .
worldwide , public-health policy is moving toward more multidisciplinary integration of engineering , medicine , social and management science , and the humanities .
by not yet embracing an integrated approach , gcc institutions risk falling behind the global standard .
technology and new approaches to public health are important ; but they will be ineffective if they are not tailored to meet the real needs of local people .
more telling , of course , will be the party primary in november .
given hollande ’s rock-bottom approval ratings , it is widely believed that the winning republican will be france ’s next president .
and though juppé remains far ahead in the opinion polls so far , the french could reject his happy version of french identity , in favor of sarkozy ’s much darker one .
i still believe that juppé is most likely to emerge as france ’s next president .
in terms of age and profile , he resembles a french version of hillary clinton , more practiced in the exercise than the conquest of power .
under the banner of “ simplification , ” the “ how ” is gravitating towards outsourcing most of the implementation to agencies that are to be endowed , one hopes , with greater flexibility to fulfill their specific missions .
this requires a smoothly working and much more efficient interface between the agencies and the european commission , which retains overall control over them , as well as a thorough revision of the financial regulation for the entire operation and its oft-criticized bureaucratic red tape .
some tough political choices lie ahead : which parts of the framework program are to be continued , and which terminated ?
how can innovation , which is never only technological , but social as well , be achieved and fully used ?
and , perhaps most importantly , what are the optimal trade-offs to get eu member states and european institutions to cooperate more efficiently for a common european future ?
despair and alienation have taken hold of the younger generation of arabs , who represent over 50 % of the region 's population .
political repression and the silence of arab public opinion should worry america and its arab allies , not reassure them , because it means that there is no way for the public to channel its interests , demands , and frustrations peacefully .
a us invasion of iraq , with large numbers of civilian casualties , would deepen the sense of victimization and defeat felt by arab youths and make them inclined to join al qaeda-style holy war cells .
far from undermining militancy and combatting terror , a war will likely play into the hands of al qaeda , giving it a new lease on life .
indeed , militant islamists , hoping to recover from the devastating blows they have absorbed since the war on terror began , are already positioning themselves to capitalize on the coming war with iraq .
but nord stream 2 would make those troubles inevitable .
a poorer ukraine would be an even easier victim of russian aggression than it is today .
and the kremlin ’s hold on belarus would be even tighter should yamal close down .
moreover , germans and other europeans would not be spared the consequences .
by committing to buy more russian gas than necessary , and for a longer time , the eu would be helping to finance russia ’s military build-up , which represents a direct threat to peace in europe .
san francisco – it seems puzzling at first : prescription drug prices in the united states continue to rise at an alarming rate , despite the threat ( or promise ) of competition from cheaper generic substitutes .
but there really is no mystery .
pharmaceutical companies pay players throughout the health-care system to favor their more expensive drugs over lower-priced alternatives .
and those who should be acting as watchdogs for patients are happy to go along .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
but while there are many reasons to blame foreign powers for the region ’s parlous state of affairs , blaming others – or even one another – will solve nothing .
after all , the arab world has many homegrown problems , too , including inefficient and ineffective governance , unholy alliances , and undeveloped national capacities .
disaster awaits any region that is helpless to shape its own future , in which a majority of citizens feel disenfranchised .
though the arab world is traditionally conservative , almost 70 % of its citizens are below the age of 35 , and young people suffer from the highest rates of unemployment in most countries .
this constitutes not only a tremendous waste of resources , but also a serious long-term sociopolitical problem .
to ensure that female vaccinators stay engaged in this fight , it is essential to address the obstacles – whether physical security , social constraints , or low pay – that they confront .
let us not forget that the risks these women take to protect everyone from a disease that has taken an enormous toll on global health .
as a polio survivor , i simply can not fathom the possibility that , with complete eradication in our sights , we might allow polio to return .
since unicef began emphasizing the hiring of women for its polio program in 2014 , the number of female vaccinators has increased dramatically .
nearly 62 % of vaccinators in nigeria are women .
a large minority of citizens in the developed world inhabits filter bubbles created by these platforms – digital false realities in which existing beliefs become more rigid and extreme .
in the us , approximately one-third of the adult population has become impervious to new ideas , including demonstrable facts .
such people are easy to manipulate , a concept that former google design ethicist tristan harris calls “ brain hacking . ”
western democracies are unprepared to deal with this threat .
the us has no effective regulatory framework for internet platforms , and lacks the political will to create one .
when american troops were captured in iraq , president bush said that he expects them to be treated humanely .
" if not , " the president warned , " the people who mistreat the prisoners will be treated as war criminals . "
president bush 's remarks drove home the importance of strict adherence to the geneva conventions and the question of how war crimes trials may be convened in post-war iraq and who will conduct them .
the us plan for war crimes trials covers violations committed before the current conflict began .
american officials recently released a list of iraqis who would face trial for past crimes .
second , today ’s algorithms are becoming very good at pattern recognition when they are provided with large data sets – finding objects in youtube videos or detecting credit card fraud – but they are much less effective with unusual circumstances that do not fit the usual pattern , or simply when the data are scarce or a bit “ noisy . ”
to handle such cases , you need a skilled person , with his or her experience , intuition , and social awareness .
third , the latest systems can not explain what they have done or why they are recommending a particular course of action .
in these “ black boxes , ” you can not simply read the code to analyze what is happening or to check if there is a hidden bias .
when interpretability is important – for example , in many medical applications – you need a trained human in the decision-making loop .
the country also advanced down the road of fiscal federalism : channeling all of vat into the federal budget , and the income tax to the regions , makes for a sensible system of distributing budgetary resources among the tiers of authority .
the second important area of progress has been reform of russia ’s federation : establishment of federal districts and reform of the federation council .
these changes are controversial , but a federation whose laws are not observed by some of its constituent members can not function normally ; a federation in which the observance of laws depends on the whim of local administrators simply can not exist .
president putin ’s moves to strengthen an integrated power system are therefore logical and correct .
as a result , russia is today a realistic , even if imperfect , federation .
for israel , this is more than a little concerning .
some of netanyahu ’s top cabinet ministers , including avigdor liberman , the hawkish defense minister , and yuval steinitz , a member of the security cabinet , quickly expressed concern about the arms deal .
within israel ’s right wing , many worry that trump is merely trying to appease israel with rhetoric , and views saudi arabia as the mainstay of us interests in the region .
it is possible that trump hopes that saudi arabia ’s support can help drive forward negotiations between israelis and palestinians .
but , given trump ’s failure to take a real stand on any of the core areas of disagreement – including borders , refugees , and the status of jerusalem – the idea that he is playing some well-thought-out long game on the israel-palestine conflict seems farfetched .
and weaknesses in the london housing market do not appear to have spread elsewhere .
in fact , in the northwest , residential real-estate prices are showing signs of accelerating upward .
if this trend does endure , it would have far-reaching implications for the uk economy .
strengthening housing markets in the north could do wonders to reverse the disturbing regional inequalities that have emerged in recent decades .
one thing we can be absolutely certain about is that the government should continue pursuing policies to engage with the northern powerhouse , and perhaps with the “ midlands engine , ” too .
new delhi – for some time now , multinational companies ( mncs ) have been gaming the rules of the global economy to minimize their tax liability – or even eliminate it altogether .
and for some time now , the independent commission for the reform of international corporate taxation ( icrict ) has argued for the unitary taxation of mncs .
fortunately , there have been some encouraging recent signs that the idea of a unitary tax is gaining traction .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
this includes : funds to stop the transmission of aids from mothers to infants ; funds to help fight infections such as tuberculosis that accompany aids ; and with good program design , even funds for anti-retroviral therapies .
with specially designed , low-cost combinations of drugs , and with the drugs provided to the poorest countries at the lowest possible production costs , it may be possible to extend arv therapies to even very poor countries at an acceptable price .
the third step must be an expanded program of research and development into new and more effective approaches to controlling the disease .
the most promising answer for the long term is a vaccine to protect against the disease .
recent breakthroughs in basic science give hope that a vaccine can be developed within a decade , if the billions of dollars of research and development funds are mobilized by both public and private sectors .
in fact , the united nations estimates that up to seven in ten women worldwide experience physical or sexual violence – or both – during their lifetime .
but violence against women can be difficult to detect .
even those who are aware of it may choose to ignore it , believing that it is none of their business or too widespread for them to make a difference , or because they are too busy to get involved .
clearly , a global shift is needed in gender-related attitudes and standards .
to this end , national governments have a responsibility to develop policies and practices that are sensitive to gender – policies that effectively discourage gender-based discrimination , while preventing violence , including by punishing its perpetrators .
this month , the new mayors took office without the electoral commission ( cse ) having made public 100 % of the votes , an open violation of nicaraguan electoral law .
although the electoral fraud in managua was the most widely documented , the same modus operandi occurred across the country , affecting more than 40 municipalities .
despite complaints from the episcopal conference of the catholic church , chambers of commerce and political parties , the cse has refused to allow a recount of the ballots or scrutiny by impartial observers .
and , when citizens protested peacefully , the government resorted to violence to curb them .
thus , the fsln government proclaimed itself winner in 109 of the 153 municipalities .
even if putin has found a way to retain power without amending the constitution – a possibility that was endlessly speculated about by russia ’s dwindling band of democrats – the undemocratic nature of his strategy is glaringly obvious .
moving from one high office in the kremlin to another in the white house ( the seat of the russian parliament ) is merely a technicality .
putin will be czar no matter what office is formally his own .
what will make this work is that , like any good kgb man , putin is a master of facades .
it has been said that presidential democracy only strengthens russian political culture ’s tendency to favor rulers with a “ strong hand , ” whereas a parliamentary system would allow for a more “ horizontal ” distribution of power .
morsi ’s timing was remarkable : the day after winning international acclaim for his successful efforts to broker a truce in gaza , he staged a frontal assault on egypt ’s nascent democracy .
the question now is whether the brothers will prevail , both in the streets and by means of egypt ’s new constitution ( which they largely wrote ) .
if they do , will the west withdraw its support for egyptian democracy in the name of “ stability ” ?
it would be a bad mistake .
the question of what to do about iran ’s nuclear program will also return with a vengeance in january , after us president barack obama ’s second inauguration and israel ’s general election , and will demand an answer within a few months .
the implication was clear : democracy on its own was not enough .
liberalism – the protection of minorities and individual civil liberties – had to be strengthened .
the word “ liberalism , ” however , does not mean the same thing to all people .
in many circles , it came to be used to describe unfettered capitalism and full freedom of choice in personal lifestyles .
and it was the alternative meanings that initially allowed politicians like orbán and the turkish leader recep tayyip erdoğan to make the case for a different form of majoritarian democracy .
despite talk of the “ green economy ” and calls for a europe-wide investment program , macron ’s agenda is broadly neoliberal .
essentially , macron is hoping that his agenda , if implemented at the eu level , will lift not just the french economy , but all european boats .
in fact , the likelihood is that such reforms will sink all boats , giving the populists their chance .
in that case , which variety of populist will seize the opportunity ?
the economist dani rodrik puts the appeal of populism into focus .
the first shock was intensified globalization , which brought a lot of new low-wage competition .
although globalization is a gradual process , it gained momentum when china decided to play the game .
china is ten times the size of japan , and japan was not easy to deal with , either .
german precision instruments and optical equipment , for example , lost their competitive edge when japan entered the game .
the second shock was eu integration , including the northern and southern enlargements .
america 's deteriorating fiscal position is leading to a strong dollar , just as the deteriorating fiscal position of the us after reagan 's irresponsible tax cut of two decades ago did .
while countries may pride themselves on a strong currency , a strong dollar is bad for exports and good for imports .
in a dynamic economy , if jobs are lost in one sector , new jobs are being created in another .
government 's role is to facilitate the movement of labor from one to the other .
it is a primary responsibility of government to maintain full employment .
to be sure , consensus , compromise , and a pooling of sovereignty are the only ways to resolve many of the great issues – climate change , nuclear proliferation – that bedevil our world .
but on the great issues of war , peace , and the balance of power , europe seems trapped between an insufficiently cohesive foreign policy and uncertainty among individual countries about how to define and secure their national interests .
by contrast , the world ’s rising powers – brazil , china , india , and russia – insist not only on the primacy of their national interests , but , as the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen last december demonstrated , on sovereign freedom of action as well .
to them , geopolitics is not anathema ; it is the basis of all their external actions .
defending the national interest still rallies their publics ; the exercise of power remains at the heart of their diplomatic calculations .
the pro-milosevic candidate , tomislav nikolic , lost , but he received 46 % of the vote .
despite his campaign promises , serbia ’s president boris tadic has so far failed to cooperate with the icty by assisting in turning over mladic ( karadzic is probably not in serbia ) , who would surely testify against milosevic .
one understands his trepidation : the first post-milosevic prime minister , zoran djindjic , cooperated with the tribunal , and paid for it with his life .
such foot-dragging exposes the icty ’s fundamental weakness : unlike the nuremberg tribunal , the international community convened it during , not after , a war .
without full control of either the evidence or the accused , the icty lacked from the outset the legitimacy and authority of “ victors ’ justice . ”
for starters , the global financial meltdown and subsequent recession laid bare the consequences of free-market fundamentalism , thereby undercutting popular and ideological support for the neoliberal view that markets are best at shaping societal outcomes .
furthermore , china – the embodiment of the go-for-growth movement – has signaled a policy shift toward the pursuit of better social and environmental outcomes , alongside more moderate gdp gains .
to be sure , this is largely a case of virtue arising from necessity ; as export-driven growth has slowed , the risk of social unrest over issues like air pollution , food toxicity , and corruption has risen .
but the new approach is also based on the recognition that china ’s continued development depends on a healthy balance between ecology and economy .
this shift is linked to a third , broader development : the world ’s growing understanding of where the planet is headed environmentally , especially in terms of climate change .
johannesburg – my country liberalized abortion more than two decades ago , but on january 23 , 2017 , us president donald trump essentially took away my right even to write the word .
as a doctor in south africa , i have provided abortion services for more than a decade .
as part of my work , i often edit educational materials for an ngo working on hiv prevention .
for young south african women , these texts offer life-saving information about issues related to sexual and reproductive health – including birth control , sexual violence , and our country ’s progressive abortion law .
but two days after the american presidential election in november 2016 – and more than two months before trump ’s inauguration – the ngo i was working for halted distribution of a reproductive-health guide because it contained information on south africa ’s constitutionally guaranteed right to an abortion .
the election campaign will heat up at a time when the us is facing a daunting set of problems .
how should it approach china ’s creation of not only facts on the ground , but the ground itself , in the south china sea ?
will russia ’s annexation of crimea stand forever ?
indeed , how can america respond firmly to russian aggression without forsaking the long-term project of bringing it closer to the west ?
is there an alternative to sending ground troops back to the middle east ?
the world can not and will not wilt in the face of such extremism , wherever it exists , whether in the sahel , nigeria , iraq , or syria .
today , the international coalition fighting isis has grown to more than 60 active members .
since september , we have retaken 700 square kilometers of territory .
we have deprived the group of the use – and resulting revenues – of 200 oil and gas facilities .
we have disrupted its command structure , undermined its propaganda , taken out half of its senior leadership , squeezed its financing , damaged its supply networks , and dispersed its personnel .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , hammers and bulldozers , not artillery , brought it down .
unfortunately , bush has not learned this lesson .
academic and scientific exchanges during the cold war played a significant role in enhancing american soft power .
while some american skeptics feared that soviet scientists and kgb agents would steal american technology , they failed to notice that the visitors vacuumed up political ideas alongside scientific secrets .
many of these scientists became leading proponents of human rights and liberalization inside the ussr .
forty years ago , japan represented the “ asian west . ”
today , the emergence of chinese-style and indian-style modernity is mentally destabilizing japan .
after all , if china is america ’s main economic partner in asia , and if india is america ’s main diplomatic partner , what is left for japan ?
its aging population watches resignedly as the new , younger asia , becomes as important for the us as europe was during the cold war .
george w bush ’s approach was to view india as the “ anti-china , ” and thereby to balance the “ biggest democracy in the world ” against the “ oldest civilization in the world . ”
new york – the global recession now underway is the result not only of a financial panic , but also of more basic uncertainty about the future direction of the world economy .
consumers are pulling back from home and automobile purchases not only because they have suffered a blow to their wealth with declining stock prices and housing values , but also because they do n’t know where to turn .
should they risk buying a new car when gasoline prices might soar again ?
will they be able to put food on the table after this year ’s terrifying rise in food prices ?
decisions about business investment are even starker .
no trace of polish authority remained .
the total destruction of the polish state and its institutions made poland an ideal location for the german extermination camps , in which six million polish citizens – three million jews and three million ethnic poles – were murdered .
everywhere else in german-controlled europe , the nazis had to deal , sometimes in an extremely complicated way , with local governments , if only for tactical reasons .
this is why poland is right to insist that the camps not be called “ polish extermination camps ” ( as even us president barack obama once mistakenly referred to them ) .
they were german camps in occupied poland .
the main suppliers to the world ’s telecoms companies are found in china , where huawei is now head to head with sweden ’s ericsson .
in 2008 , huawei registered more patents than any other company in the world , and finished second to japan ’s panasonic in 2009 .
in the telecommunications sector , there are now a half-dozen emerging-market multinationals in the global top ten .
brazil ’s embraer revolutionized airplane manufacturing with a business model that others have imitated .
india ’s tata sells cars for 75 % less than its european competitors .
even the us government , with debt duration of about four years , would be unlikely to benefit much from an inflation surprise , unless it were huge .
meanwhile , the bulk of its obligations are social security and health care , which can not be inflated away .
even for distressed households that have borrowed long term , the effects of higher inflation are uncertain .
what would help is if their nominal disposable income rose relative to their ( fixed ) debt service .
yet , with high levels of unemployment likely to keep nominal wage growth relatively subdued , typical troubled households could be worse off – with higher food and fuel prices cutting into disposable income .
though china ’s leadership will , it is hoped , lack the drama of 2009 , president xi jinping will undoubtedly make an impression of his own .
if he did not miss the opportunity to advance the goal of an asia-pacific trade agreement while hosting last year ’s asia-pacific economic cooperation summit , he certainly will not pass up the chance to ensure that the g-20 agenda serves china ’s interests .
of course , with turkey ’s term at the g-20 ’s helm having barely begun , xi probably has not yet settled on specific priorities .
but some potential areas of concern are already apparent .
elements of the current g-20 agenda align well with china ’s domestic economic concerns , especially with regard to infrastructure .
new york – after the french revolution of 1789 , deputies in the national assembly who supported the revolutionary gains sat on the left , while those who opposed them and hankered after the old order of monarchy and church congregated on the right .
hence the political terms “ left ” and “ right . ”
many commentators on the french presidential election have pointed out that these categories no longer fit contemporary politics in france – or , indeed , anywhere else .
emmanuel macron prides himself on being neither right nor left .
marine le pen , whose national front is associated with the far right , disagrees : to her , macron , who was a minister in a socialist government , is a leftist .
as a result , it will likely be a long time before we can assess the success of whatever law the us congress ultimately enacts .
but the criteria for judgment are clear : the new law must curb the practices that jeopardized the entire global economy , and reorient the financial system towards its proper tasks – managing risk , allocating capital , providing credit ( especially to small - and medium-sized enterprises ) , and operating an efficient payments system .
we should toast the likely successes : some form of financial-product safety commission will be established ; more derivative trading will move to exchanges and clearing houses from the shadows of the murky “ bespoke ” market ; and some of the worst mortgage practices will be restricted .
moreover , it looks likely that the outrageous fees charged for every debit transaction – a kind of tax that goes not for any public purpose but to fill the banks ’ coffers – will be curtailed .
but the likely failures are equally noteworthy : the problem of too-big-to-fail banks is now worse than it was before the crisis .
to be sure , most french and german citizens identify as european , as opposed to uk citizens , who identify as british – or even as english , irish , scottish , or welsh .
this is why german and french critiques of the eu generally focus on the bloc ’s performance , whereas the british often strike at the european project itself .
but when it comes to security and defense , these affinities are reversed : france and britain are very likeminded , while germany , owing to its history , has long shied away from martial pursuits of any kind .
of course , there are many differences between britain and france with respect to how they engage with the united states and nato .
the uk is naturally closer to nato than france is .
although the new tax law is generally described as a fiscal stimulus , it is more accurate to say that it avoids a large immediate fiscal contraction .
the long-term implications of the agreement stand in sharp contrast both to obama ’s february 2010 budget proposal and to the republicans ’ counter-proposal .
obama wanted to continue the 2010 tax rates permanently for all taxpayers except those with annual incomes over $ 250,000 .
the republicans proposed continuing the 2010 tax rates permanently for all taxpayers .
by agreeing to limit the current tax rates for just two years , the tax package reduces the projected national debt at the end of the decade ( relative to what it would have been with the obama budget ) by some $ 2 trillion or nearly 10 % of gdp in 2020 .
spending on automobiles ground to a halt , until government stimulus programs in many countries revived it .
but schemes such as public subsidies for scrapping old and fuel-inefficient cars simply led many people to re-schedule their purchases .
the automobile market was rescued in 2009 at the expense of sales in 2010 and subsequent years .
the crisis also revealed the extent of the massive over-capacity in the us retail market , with estimates that at least one-fifth of american shopping malls would be forced to close .
the response to the crisis will be a hastening of the movement toward on-line purchases , in which physical location is no longer a preeminent part of shopping decisions .
indeed , confucianism became the official ideology of the chinese state two centuries before the birth of christ .
confucianism was essentially a philosophical justification of government by benevolent bureaucracy under a virtuous ruler .
virtue ensured harmony between man and nature , as well as obedience within a stratified society .
as one confucian classic put it : possessing virtue will give the ruler the people .
possessing the people will give him the territory .
a damascene conversion is not only possible , but is also vital for regional peace .
the most realistic scenario is now a three-front war pitting israel against syria , hamas , and hezbollah .
but a syrian-israeli peace would drive a wedge between syria and iran , thereby cutting off hezbollah ’s lines of arms supply while allowing the vital task of stabilizing lebanon to succeed .
the only way to extricate syria from the fatal iranian embrace is to draw it into a regional scheme for peace .
alas , precisely because of their isolation and the ba’athist regime ’s paranoiac nature , the syrians are unlikely to meet the us condition for peace talks : abandoning their current rogue alliances and their marriage with terror .
for much of thailand ’s long economic boom of the past two decades , wealth resided mostly in the bangkok metropolitan area , a boon to the burgeoning urban middle class , but deeply resented by the rural majority .
while the rural population had more than enough to eat , their economic opportunities and upward mobility were limited by a shoddy education system and docile state-run media that fed them soap operas and official messages .
for a nobody to become a somebody , all roads led to bangkok and its prestigious prep schools and universities .
thailand ’s farms became increasingly alienated from the urban elite .
thaksin recognized this urban-rural divide and shrewdly exploited it , upending the elite consensus that had long prevailed .
some of the roughly 150 pro-rebellion alawites who attended the conference traveled from their homes in syria ; others were expatriates , including activists and religious leaders who had been forced to flee syria for supporting the revolution .
the delegates – joined by several sunni opposition members – denounced assad and declared their unwavering support for a united , democratic country that would offer full citizenship to all syrians , regardless of sect or ethnic background .
“ depriving the regime of the sectarian card is crucial for its ouster , ” the conference ’s organizing committee noted .
if alawites and sunnis living abroad can stand united against the assad regime , so can their counterparts inside syria .
by setting an example of coexistence , they can mitigate the fears of alawites in syria that deserting assad would facilitate the rise of an anti-alawite sunni regime .
china announced its plans for the aiib shortly after signing the ndb articles of agreement in 2014 .
in the case of the ndb , each of the brics owns an equal share , and each contributed $ 10 billion to the initial subscribed capital .
although equitable shareholding was not china ’s preferred route , it did not force the matter .
by contrast , china is the aiib ’s largest shareholder by a wide margin , holding a 26.6 % stake , compared to india ’s 7.7 % and russia ’s 6 % .
brazil and south africa , meanwhile , have made no capital contributions to date , despite being designated as “ founding members . ”
well , in both cases , the us should have said no : while the aid is transparent , the symbolism of a rich country taking money from a poor neighbor with millions of suffering people is hardly attractive .
and it is particularly bizarre that even as us policy toward mexico has greatly increased the chances of an anti-american chávez-type character becoming president there , officials are providing positive publicity to a government that is a caricature of disastrous governance .
trump ’s predecessor , barack obama , took a principled stand in us dealings with venezuela , imposing sanctions to rein in rogue behavior , a policy that drew broad bipartisan support .
the trump administration needs to stay the course , especially as lower oil prices have weakened the venezuelan government ’s hand .
instead of bashing latin america , the us needs to show it can be a steady and principled friend that will not be swayed by corrupt bribes of any type .
a similar solution should be found for the european constitution .
europe can not preach cultural pluralism and practice constitutional imperialism .
indeed , the political imperative is as great as the constitutional one .
europe , after all , is committed to democracy worldwide .
but in the european way of thinking , democracy must be spread pacifically , by persuasion , not by force of arms .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
as physicians with special training in forensic evaluations , we had traveled to tijuana to meet with juan , at the request of his lawyer .
trump appreciates what india has already done , but is urging it to do even more , using its vast earnings from exports to the us to help rebuild afghanistan ’s economy .
he also suggested that the us will work with india to create an indo-pacific security zone .
in any case , it seems that the potential for us-india security cooperation in the region , while only hinted at in trump ’s speech , has already been discussed by the two governments .
the implications of trump ’s speech extend beyond america ’s policy in afghanistan .
the address also sharpened the contours – already limned during his may visit to saudi arabia and his july visit to poland – of what might be called the “ trump doctrine . ”
it organized the postwar international order : the united nations , the bretton woods institutions , the marshall plan , the reconstruction of japan , and more .
under that order , the rest of the world has closed much of the vast technological , educational , and infrastructural gap with the us .
as economists say , global growth has been “ convergent , ” meaning that poorer countries have been catching up .
the share of the world economy represented by the us has declined by roughly half ( to around 16 % currently ) .
china now has a larger economy in absolute terms than the us , though still only around one-fourth the size in per capita terms .
a focus on corporate social responsibility could help to ensure that the benefits of industrialization are shared , while energy - and resource-efficiency requirements could help to safeguard sustainability .
and , as the sdgs recognize , resilient infrastructure and incentives for innovation are also crucial .
of course , achieving this goal , not to mention the other sdgs , will be expensive , costing an estimated $ 3.3-4.5 trillion per year .
given budgetary pressure in many donor countries , official development assistance is on the decline and can not be relied upon to fill this need .
indeed , as a report by the international committee of experts on sustainable development financing points out , the spectrum of funding for future international development frameworks must be broader than ever .
for example , if high oil prices were the result of taxes that were then redistributed to oil users , they would be unambiguously good .
to be sure , most taxes entail heavy " excess burdens " : the cost is significantly greater than the value of the revenue raised because of potential taxpayers ' myriad attempts at evasion and avoidance .
a tax on oil , however , does not entail excess burdens .
on the contrary , it implies excess benefits .
shifts to more energy-efficient means of transportation ease congestion .
so-called “ functional ” foods – or “ techno-foods ” – are those to which manufacturers add omega-3 oils , artificial sweeteners , indigestible starches , cholesterol reducers , soy or milk ( whey ) proteins , phytochemicals , and other ingredients to enable them to take advantage of “ qualified ” health claims permitted by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
sales of lesser-evil and functional foods have done well in recent years , bringing in about $ 85 billion in us sales in 2004 .
if you routinely buy such foods , you are among lohas ( lifestyles of health and sustainability ) consumers – the health food industry ’s cherished demographic base .
you buy low-carbohydrate products , energy and nutrition bars , vitamin - and mineral-fortified foods and beverages , soy foods , and practically anything with a health claim .
like many people , i thought that small , innovative companies dominated functional foods .
unity is supposed to be a foundation of prosperity .
the common market was defended at the outset in terms of the gains that would follow from increased trade .
the case for capital-market integration , and then for a single currency , was similar .
all of this recalls some powerful arguments that were made in the nineteenth century about national integration and unification .
in particular , the two countries whose problems drove much of the need for twentieth-century european integration – germany and italy – were culturally and politically highly diverse .
in a sib , the government contracts with an outside provider to achieve a measurable social goal ( like reducing recidivism among juvenile offenders ) , private impact investors finance the program ’s upfront costs , and the government promises a return to them if the program ’s targets are achieved .
recently , the obama administration proposed a $ 300 million fund to catalyze federal pay-for-performance contracts .
several existing federal programs like the community reinvestment act and the small business investment companies program are supporting the growth of impact investing funds .
according to a recent study , impact investing in the us would not exist without the support of and partnership with the federal government through grants , loans , and guarantees .
metrics are an essential feature of pay-for-performance contracts , and must be an essential feature of all government programs .
their presence indicates that behind the parade ’s martial rhetoric and symbolism , a broader and more complex story of china ’s wartime experience is emerging .
china is keen to stress its role as one of the key allies in the fight against fascism and imperialism in wwii , and increasingly regards western ignorance of its wartime role as unacceptable .
but ignorance in the west of china ’s wartime sacrifices – 14 million dead – and of its major contribution in holding down more than a half-million japanese troops also reflects the partisan history of the war that was taught in china itself .
under mao ’s rule , the only acceptable narrative was that the ccp led the resistance against japan .
foreign assistance – including the major us role in wartime china – had no place in this story .
but are these newfound wealth effects really all that they are made out to be ?
yes , the stock market is now at an all-time high – but only in current dollars .
in real terms , the s & p 500 is still 20 % below its january 2000 peak .
similarly , while the case-shiller index of us home prices is now up 10.2 % over the year ending march 2013 , it remains 28 % below its 2006 peak .
wealth creation matters , but not until it recoups the wealth destruction that preceded it .
the left is deeply divided on virtually all issues – europe , secularism , education , business , and more – making it extremely difficult to identify what exactly constitutes “ leftist ” policies nowadays .
in fact , the socialists have started distinguishing themselves not by what they are , but by what they are not , touting the line , “ neither macron nor mélenchon ” ( a reference to the far-left jean-luc mélenchon ) .
yet that distinction may not be as powerful as the socialists may believe .
after all , it was their center-left voters who got macron elected .
and they knew what they were voting for : every policy he has implemented thus far was included in his campaign platform .
there is even less risk in saudi arabia itself , where king abdullah recently promised more than $ 130 billion in stimulus spending .
the few saudi demonstrations appear populated almost entirely by minority shia , who find little sympathy among majority sunnis , and by foreign construction workers petitioning for higher wages and better working conditions .
syria ’s president bashar al-assad has more domestic support than recent media accounts of unrest in the country ’s south suggest .
nor does iran ’s government appear to face real danger .
the brutal crackdown on post-election protests in 2009 demonstrated the regime ’s determination to maintain order by any means necessary .
mexico city – four central american countries – guatemala , el salvador , honduras , and nicaragua – are struggling , still burdened by the legacy of the last century ’s wars .
they are resilient yet incomplete democracies , challenged by poverty , violence , and corruption – and all but forgotten by the international community .
but now there is reason to hope that these countries ’ prospects could improve .
nicaragua , it should be noted , is not quite in the same category as central america ’s other three .
like them , it suffered through a brutal and protracted civil war ; unlike them , however , successive governments have built institutions capable of supporting a reasonable level of territorial control and domestic security .
ten governments in the region already have debt-to-gdp ratios over 75 % .
as growth has slowed , public expenditures have declined , fueling economic insecurity .
even where fiscal adjustment has barely started , the old model of rent distribution has become unaffordable , and the population has turned against regimes that seem unable or unwilling to make a convincing reformist effort .
moreover , the new popular movements in algeria , sudan , lebanon , and iraq have absorbed important lessons from the 2011 uprisings .
no longer content with merely displacing aging autocrats , protesters are also targeting key elements of the deep state and the security forces .
us president donald trump ’s administration , however , is throwing this carefully calibrated system into disarray .
far from displaying a capacity to persuade , as the title of his book the art of the deal might imply , trump is attempting to use raw power alone to force his “ america first ” agenda on the rest of the world .
there are ample examples of trump ’s predilection for power .
it is reflected in his pressure on european countries not only to spend more on defense to fulfill their nato obligations – a valid demand – but also that they must continue to channel that spending toward us-made weapons systems .
it is also evident in his bellicose threats against america ’s purported enemies .
a comprehensive assessment of a country ’s macro investment risk requires looking systematically at the stocks and flows of the national account to capture all dangers , including risk in the financial system and the real economy , as well as wider risk issues .
as we have seen in recent crises , private risk taking and debt are socialized when a crisis occurs .
so , even when public deficits and debt are low before a crisis , they can rise sharply after one erupts .
governments that looked fiscally sound suddenly appear insolvent .
using 200 quantitative variables and factors to score 174 countries on a quarterly basis , we have identified a number of countries where investors are missing risks – and opportunities .
abedi ’s barbaric act , by contrast , killed at least 22 people , many of them children .
in recent years , i have been heavily involved in the policy aspects of this great city ’s economic revival .
i chaired an economic advisory group to the greater manchester council , and then served as chair of the cities growth commission , which advocated for the “ northern powerhouse , ” a program to link the cities of the british north into a cohesive economic unit .
subsequently , i briefly joined david cameron ’s government , to help implement the early stages of the northern powerhouse .
i have never attended a concert at the manchester arena , but it appears to be a great venue for the city .
nile delta – about 60 miles north of cairo ’s tahrir square – the epicenter of the egyptian uprising in 2011 – there is a secondary school students call “ the prison . ”
a deformed box of concrete packed with dilapidated classrooms , the school is pockmarked with age and neglect .
one teacher in the sleepy nile delta village morbidly quips that it doubles as a morgue .
“ we never saw a revolution here , ” he said a few months ago , withholding his name for fear of losing his job .
“ a lot of the hope we had is now dead … it was killed . ”
yet the ten-year fiscal plan approved by the board for the 2017-2026 period – which inevitably will form the basis of debt-restructuring discussions – seems to ignore this circularity .
the plan itself recognizes that its adoption implies another “ lost decade ” of economic activity and will weaken the island ’s debt sustainability , thus perpetuating a crisis that all parties would like to end .
unfortunately , the board ’s already-deep projected fall in real gnp is highly optimistic , because it relies on a number of implausible and/or controversial assumptions .
five flaws in the board ’s fiscal plan stand out .
first , the projected fiscal multipliers – the amount by which gnp will fall as a result of each dollar of fiscal contraction – used for the gnp forecast assume that a contraction of one dollar in the primary fiscal deficit will be associated with a $ 1.34 contraction of gnp .
such control is detrimental to the evolution of open societies .
removing this constraint might endanger the bank 's triple a rating , but will make it more effective .
i propose that the world 's open societies form an alliance with a dual purpose : fostering both development of open societies in individual countries and the evolution of a global open society .
the first involves development assistance ; the second , strengthening international institutions , such as an international central bank and a world development agency .
such an alliance requires the co-operation not only of governments , but also of civil society .
accra – planned parenthood , a vital source of sexual and reproductive health services in the united states , has just been forced to withdraw from the federal title x family-planning program , which supports low-income women .
the decision – a response to a new rule by us president donald trump ’s administration forbidding title x clinics from referring patients for abortions – will cost planned parenthood about $ 60 million annually .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
yet post-conflict employment policies almost always neglect so-called “ horizontal inequalities . ”
for example , employment policies did little to reduce the strong regional imbalances and discrimination within regions that persisted in bosnia and herzegovina after the war there in the 1990s .
given these failings , it is not surprising that employment policies ’ net effects are often very small relative to the size of the problem .
in both kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina , job creation was thought to be central to post-conflict peacekeeping efforts .
yet , in kosovo , unemployment stood at 45 % six years after its war ended .
we will strengthen assistance for developing countries , and lead the world toward further prosperity .
prosperity is the very foundation of peace .
japan will make even greater efforts to fight against poverty , which also serves as a hotbed of violence , and to provide opportunities for medical services , education , and self-reliance to all the people in the world .
we will engrave in our hearts the past , when japan ended up becoming a challenger to the international order .
upon this reflection , japan will firmly uphold basic values such as freedom , democracy , and human rights as unyielding values , and , by working hand in hand with countries that share such values , hoist the flag of “ proactive contribution to peace , ” and contribute to the peace and prosperity of the world more than ever before .
in saudi arabia , the shia are at the forefront of those welcoming democratic change and participation .
although they constitute only 20 % of the total saudi population , they form a majority -75 % - of the population in the oil-rich region .
saudi arabia ’s shia have suffered discrimination in the professions : in the military , in high government positions , the diplomatic corps , and most significantly , in the oil industry , where they have been excluded since the 1980 ’s .
this systematic neutering of the shia in saudi arabia is legitimised by the wahhabi religious establishment and supported by numerous fatwas denouncing them as heretics .
in bahrain , the shia who form 75 % of the population have been keen on the reforms initiated by king hamad al-khalifah .
by pooling resources , the fund created economies of scale for life-saving products such as anti-malarial bed nets and antiretroviral drugs .
then , by working with almost 100 countries , the fund built a massive supply chain to deliver the goods .
in the process , deaths from aids have fallen by 50 % from their peak , and malaria deaths have decreased by about 50 % since the turn of the millennium .
now , the fund has $ 14 billion in new funding to continue this work .
the replenishment is vitally important news , first and foremost because of the sheer number of lives it will help to save .
the higher the education , it seems , the lower the voter participation : among those who never vote , the percent of people with higher education is twice as high as that of people without higher education .
alienated for so long , the country 's brightest people have washed their hands of politics .
this is a sort of political depression .
depression can be cured , but only by giving the patient a positive vision of the future .
the right-centrist parties – the union of the right forces and yabloko – do have such a vision and people know it .
but broad international support will not be forthcoming if military operations are perceived as some form of western neo-imperialism .
this last point has been at the heart of the problems in iraq .
augmenting us and british troops with other " western " forces would not , particularly at this late stage , change the fundamental perception of that intervention , both in the arab world and beyond it .
only the explicit , up-front approval of a reformed un security council can provide the legitimacy and international support that military action - with the exception of clear self-defense - requires .
this is true for actions contemplated by individual nations , temporary alliances , or more permanent alliances such as nato .
second , we measured the effects of natural selection by noting that women who were shorter and first gave birth when younger had more children .
but genes are only one of many factors that influence height and age at first birth .
personal decisions , nutrition , income level , education , and religious affiliation all enter the mix .
when we estimated how much of the variation among individuals could be attributed to biology , the answer was less than 5 % .
that left 95 % of the variation to be explained by the effects of culture and individual decisions .
sofia – at a time when the ongoing european debt crisis is fracturing public faith in the continent ’s political and economic institutions , one would expect europe ’s leaders to strengthen as many unifying symbols as they can .
instead , they have allowed one of the jewels of post-world war ii european integration – the european court of human rights ( echr ) – to come under threat as well .
unlike the brussels-based european union , long beleaguered by its democratic deficit , the strasbourg-based echr is , if anything , too well loved .
in 2011 , more than 60,000 people sought its help – far more than can expect a reasoned decision .
( by contrast , the united states supreme court receives roughly 10,000 petitions a year . )
in a world of competing demands , corrupt governments may seem to serve vital purposes .
one deploys soldiers to the fight against terrorism ; another provides critical energy supplies or access to raw materials .
leaders must inevitably contend with difficult tradeoffs .
to determine the best approach in each specific case , governments must analyze the problem more effectively , which means improving the collection of intelligence and data .
as security expert sarah chayes argues in against corruption , the volume of essays that the british government will publish to accompany the summit , corruption today is structured practice .
willingly or not , some may seek recourse to inflation or administrative measures aimed at trapping domestic savings into financing the state and keeping bond rates low ( what economists call financial repression ) – or , eventually , to outright debt restructuring .
all three unorthodox remedies have been used in past debt crises .
they can be regarded as alternative forms of taxation , albeit implicit rather than explicit .
in the end , they are different methods of forcing current and future generations to shoulder the burden of accumulated debt .
is it preferable to adjust in full ?
but one must be cautious about visions .
sometimes leaders think that vision can solve most of their problems , but the wrong vision – or an overly ambitious vision – can do damage .
george h.w. bush was faulted ( and faulted himself ) for not having what he called “ the vision thing . ”
when pressed by his staff to speak more boldly and expansively , he replied , “ it ’s just not me . ”
after the shock of the september 2001 terrorist attacks , his son , george w. bush , developed a far more ambitious vision .
and the private sector has come around to viewing renewable energies as a potentially profitable business .
in the us , the cost of wind energy has fallen by two-thirds since 2009 , and the cost of utility-scale solar energy has decreased by 85 % .
in addition , according to a recent us department of energy report , the number of jobs in the wind and solar industries increased by 32 % and 25 % , respectively , in 2016 alone .
trump ’s policy priorities will inevitably clash with those of states such as california , which has been taking the initiative to encourage climate-minded technological innovation .
and , fortunately for the planet , other global powers are not joining trump in backing away from their climate commitments .
moreover , if conditions in the eurozone continue to deteriorate , asia could be more severely affected .
already , spillover effects from trade and financial transmission channels are beginning to take their toll : china ’s gdp growth rate in the second quarter of 2012 averaged 7.6 % , reflecting a significant slowdown , and india ’s growth rate is expected to decline to roughly 6 % this year .
china ’s potentially strong domestic-demand base and ample room for policy maneuvers can help it to avoid a hard landing .
it has already aggressively loosened monetary policy , and it can employ further fiscal stimulus .
but policy mismanagement and structural weaknesses in the financial sector and local governments could undermine efforts to safeguard growth .
using historical data compiled by the economic historian angus maddison , they show how other east asian countries experienced a deceleration of economic growth after their per capita gdp reached about $ 11,000 in purchasing-power-parity terms relative to constant 1990 us dollar prices , or $ 17,000 in constant 2005 us dollar prices .
for example , in the five years after japan reached that level , its economy grew at an average annual rate of 3.6 % .
in south korea , growth fell to 4.8 % .
in hong kong , it slowed to 5.8 % .
given that china is projected to cross the same threshold sometime this year , many believe its average annual growth over the next five years will fall well below 7 % .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
pompeo ’s primary line of attack against obama ’s famous cairo speech , “ a new beginning , ” is that it included a public admission of the united states ’ past missteps in the region .
unlike the trump administration , obama and his advisers believed that there is much to be gained by acknowledging difficult political truths , even when doing so points to a radical change in course .
some of the best people serving the ecb – or who have served in the past – are from small countries .
preventing small countries – as well as other big ones – from competing for specific vacant seats reduces the executive board ’s potential competency .
giving big countries permanent seats on the executive board also makes it easier for their politicians to control the ecb through the appointments process .
it is much more difficult to appoint a political puppet to the board in a system of open competition than under the current scheme .
the last thing the ecb needs is a political crony of german chancellor gerhard schroeder assuming mr. issing ’s key post .
but labor costs increased much faster in the south , resulting in differential cost increases that can not be addressed by devaluation as long as the monetary union endures .
as long as this internal divergence persists , the euro crisis can not be fully resolved , because current-account deficits and/or slow growth will continue to stalk the southern european countries , perpetuating worries about sovereign debt and commercial banks .
in this context , productivity growth whether through technical progress , better allocation of resources , or productive investment – is as important a variable for the southern economies as wage restraint is .
indeed , excessive wage deflation is likely to have negative effects on productivity .
skilled labor is likely to emigrate faster , and extreme austerity , falling prices , and high unemployment – and the resulting likelihood of social tension – are not exactly conducive to investment , innovation , or labor mobility .
of course , that does not mean that no identity is claimed .
former prime minister john major called the uk “ the country of long shadows on cricket grounds , warm beer , invincible green suburbs , dog lovers , and pools fillers and , as george orwell said , ‘ old maids bicycling to holy communion through the morning mist ’ … ” but what he was really describing was england .
indeed , the key elements of modern british identity all seem to belong to england , rather than to the composite entity .
likewise , the established or state church is the church of england , created almost 500 years ago when king henry viii decided that the catholic pope should not adjudicate his marriage .
an institution called english heritage curates the past , from the prehistoric monuments of stonehenge to the old country houses that are celebrated in television costume dramas .
both abe and obama are focused on creating a durable structure of peace for all of asia , and abe has been eager for japan to play a more active role in this regard , and in supporting its allies .
that stance is making the alliance much more a partnership of equals than it has been for the last six decades .
in america ’s view , the reinterpretation of article 9 of japan ’s “ peace constitution ” that abe undertook – thereby allowing japan ’s self-defense forces to aid allies under attack and to assist the us and other allies in meeting their commitments to securing asia ’s peace – was long overdue .
that bold policy initiative – in the face of the japanese public ’s deeply ingrained skepticism toward any increased exposure to military risks – has no doubt endeared abe to us diplomats and military strategists , as well as secured both open and sometimes tacit approval from japan ’s asian neighbors .
increased military cooperation with the us is particularly important now , given american worries about many of its other strategic partners ’ readiness .
iran is at a pivotal moment in its history – and , as the long lines of citizens eager to cast their votes clearly showed , iranians know it .
indeed , despite the iranian regime ’s lack of transparency , khamenei ’s health problems are public knowledge .
khamenei himself recently admitted that the probability that his successor should be named in the near future was “ not low . ”
the matter of who occupies the presidency during that transition is certainly not inconsequential .
with khamenei having served as president before rising to iran ’s highest political and religious leadership position , it is easy to see that the conservative candidate raisi , had he been elected , could have become khamenei ’s successor .
furthermore , north korea ’s development of nuclear weapons , its economic fragility , and uncertainty about its very future as a state , are causes of deep anxiety among its neighbors .
yet , despite all of these obstacles , there are signs that momentum is building for greater regional cooperation in overcoming them .
the recent trilateral summit of china , south korea , and japan is the fourth such meeting to be held , in addition to meetings that take place at international gatherings such as the asean summits .
unfortunately , however , the leaders of china , south korea , and japan have not yet made any major breakthrough on the most sensitive security issues that divide them .
but this lack of quick success does not mean that these efforts are futile .
and , of course , hard-pressed middle-class american consumers benefit hugely from low-cost chinese imports – the walmart effect – that enable them to stretch their budgets in an era of unrelenting pressure on jobs and real incomes .
for more than 20 years , this mutually beneficial codependency has served both countries well in compensating for their inherent saving imbalances while satisfying their respective growth agendas .
but here the past should not be viewed as prologue .
a seismic shift is at hand , and america ’s recent fiscal follies may well be the tipping point .
china has made a conscious strategic decision to alter its growth strategy .
ten-year treasury bonds now yield just 2.5 % .
with the current inflation rate of more than 2 % and markets anticipating a similar inflation rate over the longer term ( as measured by five-year five-year-forward inflation expectations ) , the yield on ten-year treasury bonds should be above 4 % .
a rise of the ten-year yield to 4 % would reduce the value of those bonds substantially .
other long-term bonds – both government bonds and corporate bonds – would suffer similar declines .
reaching for yield has also narrowed credit spreads between high-grade bonds and riskier domestic and emerging-market bonds .
without this confidence , credit will not flow and economic activity will be constrained .
moreover , because financial institutions ’ assets were bought mainly with borrowed money , the shortage of credit is exacerbated by their need to deleverage .
since raising capital is difficult and costly , they deleverage by lending less .
but the macroeconomic weakness in the us now goes beyond the decreased supply of credit . falling house prices reduce household wealth and therefore consumer spending .
falling employment lowers wage and salary incomes .
enabling america to sell its risky financial products and engage in speculation all over the world may have served its firms well , even if they imposed large costs on others .
today , the risk is that the new keynesian doctrines will be used and abused to serve some of the same interests .
have those who pushed deregulation ten years ago learned their lesson ?
or will they simply push for cosmetic reforms – the minimum required to justify the mega-trillion dollar bailouts ?
has there been a change of heart , or only a change in strategy ?
this growth has been driven by a variety of factors .
wage restraint and productivity gains have improved competitiveness , thereby boosting exports .
and now that lower oil prices and a five-percentage-point drop in unemployment are bolstering consumption , the recovery is expanding to other sectors .
in short , the credibility that ireland gained through resolute fiscal policy and reforms helped to restore confidence , facilitating a return to growth and thus fiscal consolidation .
of course , the precise policy approach taken in one country can not be imitated elsewhere .
the third component is the exercise of suasion on bondholders to achieve maximum participation , obtain binding pre-commitments , and eliminate free riders .
since this scheme would imply losses for bondholders , substantial official muscle and peer pressure is needed .
but gaining time for a more orderly resolution , mitigating contagion , and reducing the size of an eventual write-down do indeed add up to a superior outcome .
therefore , under this model – and despite the initial pressure – the behavior of bondholders could be considered truly voluntary .
and , while rating agencies might still regard a vienna-type outcome as a default , the talmudic sages show us why a more thoughtful classification is required .
in some sense , a market economy is a gift-exchange system ; money merely tracks the value of the gifts we give one another .
as a result , a market economy encourages specialization : we become very good in a narrow set of skills or products , and exchange them for millions of other things we have no clue how to do or make .
as a consequence , we end up doing remarkably few things and buying everything else from others .
this observation is as true about an individual as it is about a place , whether the place is a neighborhood , a town , a state or province , or a country .
every town has grocery stores , beauty parlors , gas stations , and movie theaters that serve the local community .
another consortium began to build multi-billion dollar oil and gas pipelines from azerbaijan through georgia to turkey and the west .
but these investments brought no economic trickle down .
people here survive on a few dollars a day .
the oil and gas pipelines are transport conduits , not real employers .
moreover , georgia 's reward for providing a strategic export route to the west for azeri oil was not dollars , but a diplomatic insurance policy - i.e. , western , especially us , concern for the safety of the pipelines .
japanese shares are worth half their 1990 prices .
even in hong kong , where shares recently hit new highs , they are only 10 % above the peak of early 1994 .
in the same three year period , prices in wall street and europe skyrocketed by 60 % or more .
this picture bears no relation to what we hear in political speeches or read in business newspapers .
politicians warn of the challenge posed by asia 's " tiger economies " .
national banking systems should be unified , in order to separate private losses from sovereign debt , with centralized supervision and resolution authorities , as well as a deposit-insurance scheme , forming the core of a european banking union .
strong central institutions , responsible to a directly elected parliament , are needed to coordinate fiscal and economic policies .
in the shorter term , the single market should be extended to services , and free-trade arrangements should be promoted either multilaterally or bilaterally with major trading partners such as the united states .
austerity should be eased , particularly in the fiscally stronger core economies , and substantial resources should be devoted to boosting youth employment and investment in small and medium-size firms in the over-indebted countries .
germany ’s reluctance to lead on these issues partly reflects historical inhibitions , which are always difficult to overcome .
china , which has just been celebrating with a martial pomp the sixtieth anniversary of mao ’s founding of the “ people ’s republic ” constitutes one of the most interesting cases of a nation evincing “ short sightedness ” towards its past .
china has a lot to show for in its recent history .
just consider the massive access to education of its huge rural population in contrast with its “ democratic rival ” india . so china ’s pride nowadays is legitimate .
in sixty years a weak and divided country , one torn apart by wars internal and external , is about to become the second most powerful economy in the world .
china ’s insolent prosperity , even if it is far from being distributed equally , china ’s relative political stability , even if the regime ’s opening remains strictly limited , are undeniable and deserving of respect .
the interest-rate premium that the market would inevitably demand from a young sovereign like scotland could be minimized by issuing debt in sterling , thereby protecting investors from additional devaluation risk .
but , without its own currency-issuing central bank , scotland would forego seigniorage ( profits from central-bank operations that typically benefit the national treasury ) .
perhaps more important , it would have no lender of last resort capable of stabilizing the banking and financial system in a crisis .
all things considered , an independent scotland would be best served by issuing its own national currency from the outset , empowering the national bank of scotland to set interest rates according to domestic economic conditions .
by allowing for exchange-rate flexibility , this approach would also enable the central bank to avoid the twin hazards that arise in a currency union : undervaluation , which produces inflationary pressure , and overvaluation , which demands wrenching internal devaluations ( driving down real wages ) .
value-subtracting heavy industries shrunk , services expanded to over 50 % of gdp , and the private sector produces almost 60 % of russian output .
although transition was bound to be painful , russia 's epidemic of corruption caused more political damage than the economic side effects of reform .
government tolerance of bribery and racketeering enabled opponents to say the " mafia " was grabbing the gains of economic change .
the government , and thus economic reform , will pay for this neglect at the polls .
corruption blights reform throughout the ex-communist world .
he is neither corrupt nor a war criminal , neither aggressive in his utterance and behavior nor likely to bend the law for the sake of personal power .
many people voted by for him by default , both now and when he defeated miloševic in 2000 .
though he does not sacrifice major moral principles for power , koštunica is not the unassuming lawyer he once was .
he crams his party with mediocrities , selects mostly bad advisers , and does not listen to the rare good ones .
it is possible that his image as a right-of-center democrat conceals a reactionary who would like for serbia to restore its pre-wwii monarchy and for the orthodox church to play a major role in political and social life .
or the yellow vests may turn out to lack that boldness and settle for the paltry pleasure of being seen on television .
they will allow themselves to become intoxicated by the sight of luminaries and experts of la france d’en haut ( elite france ) seeming to eat from their hands and hanging on their every word .
but if the yellow vests allow passionate hate to win out over genuine fraternity and choose wrecking over reforming , they will bring only chaos , not improvement , to the lives of humble and vulnerable people .
they will careen off into the darkest side of the political night , and end up in the dustbin of history , where they can rub elbows with those other yellows , the early-twentieth-century “ yellow socialists ” of the proto-fascist syndicalist pierre biétry .
the yellow vests must choose : democratic re-invention , or an updated version of the national socialist leagues ; a will to repair , or the urge to destroy .
according to the vice-president of the iranian-turkish business council , “ it is extremely complicated to do business in iran . ”
a former turkish diplomat in iran described the business climate in stark terms : “ it is as if iranians prefer a lose/lose outcome to a win/win one in their dealings with foreign partners . ”
what lessons can be drawn from the failure of turkish businesses in iran ? some blame appalling infrastructure and high road taxes .
others suggest that iran ’s almost non-existent banking system is the culprit .
still others blame the “ invisible hand of america , ” which is supposed to fear that iran and turkey could become too powerful .
moreover , we must invest in research and development of low-cost diabetes treatments and diagnostic tools that are suited for low-resource environments .
smart collaborative projects that bring innovative thinkers from nonprofits , academia , and the private sector together to create effective , affordable , and appropriate solutions are desperately needed .
diabetes is not unique among ncds .
essential medicines and technologies for diagnosing and treating heart disease , cancer , and respiratory ailments are also significantly less available and proportionally more expensive for people in low - and middle-income countries than they are for those in the rich world .
this disparity prompted the medical journal the lancet to call the ncd crisis the “ social justice issue of our time . ”
south orange , new jersey – if an international organization made recommendations for improving a country ’s economy , and the country adopted fewer than half of them , the organization might seem like a failure .
but an international organization should be judged according to the quality of the information and advice that it provides , not by whether governments listen .
indeed , measuring its success solely on the basis of compliance ignores the purpose : to encourage – and facilitate – reform by informing officials about its costs and benefits .
every 18 months , the organization for economic cooperation and development releases an economic survey of each of its 34 member countries , including a list of previous recommendations and their implementation status .
in its 2010 survey of the united states , the oecd made 29 recommendations , from rebuilding the national electricity grid to expanding health-care coverage to implementing a cap-and-trade scheme .
he also must not do anything to weaken the us ’s alliances with south korea and japan , which will require him to maintain close contact with both moon and japanese prime minister shinzo abe throughout the process , lest either leader feels ignored or undermined .
moreover , he will need to keep all alternatives on the table , even though military options are becoming less tenable in the context of inter-korean dialogue .
most important , he will need to get the north korean regime at least to acknowledge that genuine denuclearization is the goal , and to agree to a process for continued dialogue , perhaps culminating in another summit .
whatever the outcome , trump would do well to ask himself if it is any better than the joint comprehensive plan of action with iran , which he has described has “ the worst deal ever . ”
then again , persuading trump to engage in self-reflection could prove to be the toughest challenge yet .
another way of looking at the german election outcome , then , is as an opportunity for a new beginning .
an end to the cdu-spd “ grand coalition ” could mean an end to political stagnation not just in germany , but at the european level , too .
germany ’s post-election coalition negotiations are now underway , and , with the sdp determined not to join the government , the most likely result is a “ jamaica ” alliance ( named for the colors of that country ’s flag ) , comprising the cdu , the free democrats ( fdp ) , and the greens .
germany ’s next government , one hopes , will include pro-european politicians with fresh ideas and a willingness to push for european-level reforms , possibly along the lines of what macron has proposed .
in that case , a new crop of leaders could be a driving force shaping germany ’s role in europe for years to come .
the timing could not have been worse .
elimination of fuel subsidies caused riots and widespread strikes against the transition government , which gave an excuse for nigeria 's generals to re-assert military control .
it would take six long years under rapacious military rule before nigeria received another chance at democracy .
last year , nigeria celebrated a remarkable escape from dictatorship .
after the brutal and hyper-corrupt military ruler general sani abacha – who suddenly dropped dead – the military sullenly agreed to another national election .
these barriers are particularly high for lgbtqi individuals , women with disabilities , indigenous women , rural women , and adolescents .
instead of sidestepping the issue of sexual and reproductive health – and gender equality more broadly – governments must acknowledge their responsibility to address women ’s needs .
they must consider the central role that sexual and reproductive health plays in women ’s lives , the integrated nature of women ’s health , and its impact on communities .
and they must design uhc programs accordingly .
for example , to reduce maternal mortality , it is not enough to provide antenatal attention , safe delivery , and postnatal care ; women also need access to safe , legal , and affordable abortion services and post-abortion care .
likewise , little progress toward nuclear disarmament has been made , in disregard of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
brazil ’s abundance of energy , food , water , and biodiversity increases its stake in a security environment characterized by rising competition for access to , or control of , natural resources .
in order to meet the challenges of this complex reality , brazil ’s peaceful foreign policy must be supported by a robust defense policy .
brazil ’s national defense strategy , updated in 2012 , states that the modernization of the armed forces is intrinsically linked to national development .
thus , it emphasizes the need to strengthen the domestic defense industry .
yao ming , the chinese star of the national basketball association ’s houston rockets , could become another michael jordan , and china is set to host the 2008 summer olympics .
large expatriate communities in the us – 2.4 million chinese and 1.7 million indians – have increased interest in their home countries among other americans .
moreover , transnational connections in the information industry are close , as western high-tech companies increasingly employ affiliates in bangalore and shanghai to provide real-time services .
but the real promise for china and india lies in the future .
a country ’s soft power rests upon the attractiveness of its culture , the appeal of its domestic political and social values , and the style and substance of its foreign policies .
the european commission ’s agreement in september to postpone full implementation of ukraine ’s association agreement with the european union – the agreement that ukrainians fought and died for in kyiv last winter – signaled to putin that cunning , force , and intimidation can win western acquiescence in his subjugation of ukraine and theft of crimea .
the delay , intended to show the eu ’s determination to make the association agreement work , has instead only whetted putin ’s appetite .
his hope is that some eu members ’ interest in securing russian gas supplies during the winter will cause them to forget their allies ’ security interests – a classic divide-and-rule strategy , served chilled .
europe can not afford to be taken in by it .
ukraine may now only be passing through the eye of the storm .
to this end , it is critical to reframe the constitution to incorporate regional interests and recognize that the uk is a multinational state .
such radical change – and , to match the scale of the crisis , it must be radical – will require a nationwide discussion , which could be conducted via a people ’s constitutional convention .
that convention should start by examining brexit ’s impact on regions .
we should ask , for example , whether it makes sense to repatriate powers and financial transfers from brussels to westminster , or if some powers and financing should instead be devolved to the regions and nations .
where possible , regional funds and policymaking powers – including environmental regulation and oversight of agriculture , fisheries , and local social programs – should be delegated to the appropriate regional authorities , such as the scottish parliament , the welsh and northern irish assemblies , city mayors , and local authorities .
as a result , the us is no longer in a position to set the world ’s agenda .
the eu can not possibly take the place of the us as the world ’s leader .
but it can set an example , both within its own borders and beyond .
the prospect of membership has been the most powerful tool in turning candidate countries into open societies .
although most of its citizens do not realize it , the eu serves as an inspiring example .
to be sure , putin considers the olympics – and , specifically , medals – to be very important .
like his old soviet masters , he conflates athletic glory with military glory .
that is why he personally lobbied for russia to host the 2014 winter games in sochi ; the unprecedented $ 50 billion price tag was well worth it , considering that russia won the most medals .
( it was russia ’s actions during the sochi olympics that form the core of the doping scandal . )
this is not to say that athletic glory substitutes for military glory .
but that is simply an attempt to make a virtue out of necessity : for a country with one of the world ’s largest and most storied bureaucracies , china has a surprisingly difficult time telling its business community not to do business with someone , especially a historic friend and ally .
chinese leaders ’ longstanding reluctance to participate in international sanctions is often attributed to their belief in judging actions by whether or not they work .
perhaps the real pragmatism on display in the case of north korea is a reluctance to rein in the business community at a time of slower growth and internal fixation .
china ’s rise is one of the most studied developments of our time .
it is , after all , a country that can be described as a civilization , and its trajectory has been far more impressive than that of any north korean rocket .
washington , dc – the sharp drop in the price of crude oil since late june has been grabbing headlines worldwide – and producing a lot of contradictory explanations .
some attribute the fall largely to declining global growth expectations .
others focus on the expansion of america ’s oil and gas production .
still others suspect a tacit agreement between saudi arabia and the united states aimed at , among other things , weakening political rivals like russia and iran .
regardless of the reason for the price drop – probably to be found in some combination of these factors – the consequences are the same .
the global oil situation is particularly interesting at the moment .
at around $ 30 a barrel , oil prices are remaining high even though a soft global economy means that world demand is low .
the previously fashionable view that the american seizure of iraqi oil resources would break opec and send the price of oil plummeting has turned out to be nonsense .
even with improved security , it will take five years to get iraq oil fully on stream .
with the american economy now recovering strongly , the price of oil should stay high , or even rise further , in the foreseeable future .
after all , if markets truly believed that the ecb would refuse to backstop errant governments , investors would run away from participating countries at the first sign that conditionality was not being met .
as with its predecessor , the securities markets program , the omt program is legally and democratically questionable : it violates the spirit , but not the letter , of the european union treaty ’s no-bailout clause ; its promise of equal treatment with private creditors still has no precedent ; and it involves back-door fiscal transfers , leaving the ecb heavily exposed to political backlash – witness the visceral reaction of the german press to ecb president mario draghi ’s announcement .
but omts also fit well with a large body of historical evidence that , in times of crisis , policymakers must focus on extinguishing the fire , rather than negotiating over who owns the water and what its cost should be .
the omt program will cause credit conditions to ease , but without necessarily reversing the financial balkanization of the eurozone that has occurred over the last three years .
reversal of that process will likely not occur until the three key elements of banking union – common supervision , common deposit insurance , and a common resolution fund – are within tangible reach .
for starters , bipartisan proposals for premium support , with seniors receiving subsidies to purchase private health insurance , should be implemented .
to enable individuals to prepare to cover the associated deductibles and copayments , health savings accounts – funds which are not subject to income tax at the time of deposit , and can be used tax-free at any time to cover qualified medical expenses – should be expanded and strengthened .
premium support can significantly reduce medicare spending , as it establishes a framework for more efficient spending on benefits , driven by competition and innovation in care and coverage .
so far , the only us presidential candidate who has recognized the need for such a future-oriented approach is former florida governor jeb bush , who has proposed modernizing reforms of social security and medicare that avoid imposing high costs on middle-income americans and a heavier debt burden on future generations .
two other republican candidates , ohio governor john kasich and florida senator marco rubio , have also raised constructive reform ideas .
silvio berlusconi , who becomes president of the european union on july 1 st , is a man of vision who once loved risk -- and whose business bets paid off big .
in the 1960 's , he was the first to see that milan , then a traditional italian city where people walked to work , would become a modern metropolis , surrounded by american-style suburbs .
so his fortune began in real estate development .
fifteen years later , signor berlusoni understood that the italian state 's monopoly of television would not survive and jump-started what became italy 's main privately owned media group .
but you do n't win in tv and the real estate business without the right political connections .
beijing – financial repression – government policies that create an environment of low or negative real interest rates , with the goal of generating cheap financing for public spending – has long been a key feature of chinese economic policy .
but , with funding costs for businesses trending up , this is finally starting to change .
early this year , the state council , china ’s cabinet , made lowering funding costs for businesses , especially small and medium-size enterprises ( smes ) , a top priority .
for its part , the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) has engaged in cautious monetary loosening , which includes freeing up more funds for lending by banks that allocate a certain proportion of their total loan portfolio to smes .
the pboc , through its “ pledged supplementary lending ” program , has also started lending directly to banks that have promised to use the funds for social housing construction .
countries with the greatest cause for concern about russia -- ukraine , estonia , latvia and lithuania -- are not to be offered nato membership .
moreover , russia is today far too weak to threaten them , as the russian army 's disastrous misadventure in chechnya demonstrates .
one day russia will be stronger , and if expanding nato to central europe now would discourage revival of an imperial foreign policy then , this would be a strong argument in favor of doing so .
but nato expansion is not likely to make russian foreign policy more peaceful ever .
russia 's democrats , who have an enormous stake in a peaceful future , are adamant that extending alliance membership to central europe will isolate their country from europe , strengthen russian political forces that favor authoritarian rule at home and neoimperial policies abroad , and , by appearing to threaten russia , provide a rallying point for reconstructing russian military power .
but that would presuppose a small gesture towards the palestinians , whom israelis regard as being so deeply divided among themselves that no progress toward a peace settlement seems possible .
israel ’s leaders seem intent on gaining time both tactically , by resisting the soft pressure of us president barack obama ’s administration , and strategically , by preparing the country for a new world in which emerging powers such as china play an increasingly important role .
that world , however , will be one in which israel can no longer count on feelings of holocaust guilt to influence major powers .
it is a world in which monotheistic rivalries will be diluted in an ocean of polytheist faiths , and in which israel will be able to depend only on its comparative merits in the eyes of cynical , realistic actors who will judge it solely on the basis of their own national interests .
israel may be “ of europe , ” and its main ally may well remain the united states for many years to come , but israeli leaders must start thinking of how their country can thrive in a post-western world .
the final trick , “ starve the beast , ” typically comes later , if and when the president has enacted his tax cuts and discovers that smoke and mirrors do not trump reality .
he can not find enough spending to cut ( the magic asterisk has disappeared up the conjurer ’s sleeve ) ; the acceleration in gdp is nowhere to be seen ( the rosy scenario having vanished ) ; and tax revenues have not grown ( no rabbit in the laffer hat ) .
the audience is now told that losing tax revenue and widening the budget deficit was the plan all along .
the performer explains that the deficit is all the fault of congress for not cutting spending and that the only way to tame the beast is to raise the budget deficit because “ congress ca n’t spend money it does n’t have . ”
this trick never works either , of course .
but there is also an urgent need to mobilize european public opinion around a symbol of our unity and our future projects : and that symbol is the european flag .
for this reason , in january one of us launched the idea that , starting on march 21 , we display the flag on houses , factories , and offices .
march 21 is the first day of spring , and we would like to believe that the coming european elections will herald a new spring for the european project .
march 21 also is the anniversary of the death of benedict , patron saint of europe .
in one of the darkest hours of the demise of the roman empire , benedict issued a stirring call for tolerance and piety to rebuild a sense of community in the face of nihilism and barbarism .
this fits into a broader trend , in which attacks by perpetrators with muslim backgrounds are immediately classified as “ acts of terror ” and addressed in a well-resourced and systemic way , while violent attacks perpetrated in the name of other ideologies are treated as an “ isolated incident . ”
but there is nothing isolated about such incidents .
according to the global terrorism index 2018 , the death toll from terrorist attacks associated with far-right groups or individuals has been steadily rising since 2014 .
in the united states , right-wing extremists have carried out far more attacks than islamists .
the attack in christchurch was directly inspired by the 2011 far-right terrorist attack in norway , of which i am one of the few lucky survivors .
the fruit of the franco-german partnership included the european single currency , the euro .
after its birth in 1999 , the german government , by now relocated from bonn to berlin , contented itself once again with a lower european profile .
that modest and unassuming role belongs firmly in the past , although german power has still to be matched by imagination .
the intellectual leadership provided by frenchmen like jean monnet and robert schuman as founding fathers of the european project is a fading memory , because germany has yet to generate a comparably robust strategy for reviving the eu ’s prospects and popularity .
indisputably the strongest and most dependable of the 28 member countries , it lacks a vision of where beleaguered europe should be heading .
china has been engaged in what might be called “ vendor finance , ” providing the money that helps finance the huge us fiscal and trade deficits , allowing americans to buy more goods than they sell .
but this is a peculiar arrangement : a relatively poor country is helping to finance america ’s war on iraq , as well as a massive tax cut for the richest people in the world ’s richest country , while huge needs at home imply ample room for expansion of both consumption and investment .
in fact , to meet the challenge of restructuring china ’s economy away from exports and resource-intensive goods , china must stimulate consumption .
while the rest of the world struggles to raise savings , china , with a savings rate in excess of 40 % , struggles to get its people to consume more .
providing better social services ( public health care , education , and nation-wide retirement programs ) would reduce the need for “ precautionary ” savings .
selling five-rupee sachets of shampoo to poor consumers is considered clever marketing , but lending 5,000 rupees to a starving peasant at high interest rates is viewed as exploitative .
both activities , after all , are financed by investors looking for returns on their capital and motivated more by profit than compassion .
but one is clearly less socially acceptable than the other .
a high salary earned by a cosmetics or soft-drink manufacturer attracts no attention ; one paid to the ceo of a company that thrives on lending to the poor appears unseemly , if not immoral .
yet pmfis had succeeded by meeting a genuine need .
berkeley – advances in artificial intelligence and robotics are powering a new wave of automation , with machines matching or outperforming humans in a fast-growing range of tasks , including some that require complex cognitive capabilities and advanced degrees .
this process has outpaced the expectations of experts ; not surprisingly , its possible adverse effects on both the quantity and quality of employment have raised serious concerns .
to listen to president donald trump ’s administration , one might think that trade remains the primary reason for the loss of manufacturing jobs in the united states .
trump ’s treasury secretary , steven mnuchin , has declared that the possible technological displacement of workers is “ not even on [ the administration ’s ] radar screen . ”
among economists , however , the consensus is that about 80 % of the loss in us manufacturing jobs over the last three decades was a result of labor-saving and productivity-enhancing technological change , with trade coming a distant second .
berkeley – back in the late 1980 ’s , japan seemingly could do no wrong in economists ’ eyes .
they saw a clear edge in japan ’s competitiveness relative to the north atlantic across a broad range of high-tech precision and mass-production industries manufacturing tradable goods .
they also saw an economy that , since reconstruction began after world war ii , had significantly outperformed the expected growth of european economies .
and they saw an economy growing considerably faster than north atlantic economies had when they possessed the same absolute and relative economy-wide productivity levels .
the safe bet in the late 1980 ’s seemed to be that mechanization , computerization , and robotization would proceed .
amos oz , one of israel 's best known writers , claims that the current palestinian-israeli war is actually two wars : an " unjust " war against israel and the jews to establish a fundamentalist islamic state in an " arab palestine , " and the palestinian people 's " just " war for an independent state worthy of the name .
conversely , israel is also fighting two wars : a just war to defend its right to exist , accepted in its integrity and security in the middle east , and an unjust and futile war to perpetuate its occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and the jewish settlements located there .
there are about 220,000 israeli settlers in the west bank and gaza , excluding the approximately 190,000 people living in the neighborhoods of jerusalem that extend beyond the pre-1967 border of the old , divided jerusalem .
despite the intifada , the number of settlers has decreased in only a few of the 144 settlements , and there are over 7,000 settlers in the gaza strip alone , in 16 communities occupying 20 % of an impoverished land already suffering one of the highest population densities in the world .
israeli state support for expanding settlements is substantial .
the market ’s reaction was to send spanish government bond rates even higher .
contrary to some perceptions , europeans have not remained inactive over the last year .
but they have lost their touch .
like aging magicians , they still try tricks that used to impress , but that fail to deliver results – or , worse , prove counterproductive .
meanwhile financial fragmentation within the eurozone continues ; spain , and to a lesser extent italy , suffers a seemingly irresistible rise in borrowing costs ; and political strains grow more visible .
with asia riven by territorial disputes and historical tensions , maintaining a stable security balance will not be easy .
but there are levers in place that can help .
in the 1990s , when us president bill clinton ’s administration was considering how to respond to china ’s increasing economic might , some urged a policy of containment .
clinton rejected that advice : it would have been impossible to forge an anti-china alliance , given the enduring desire of china ’s neighbors to maintain good relations with it ; more important , such a policy would have guaranteed future enmity with china .
instead , clinton chose a policy that could be called “ integrate and insure . ”
interests and identities are dynamically formed as politicians make offers of representation and citizens respond .
trump , for example , undoubtedly succeeded in persuading some americans to see themselves as part of something like a white identity movement .
but that identity – and the way its adherents frame their interests – could change again .
the image of an irresistible populist “ wave ” was always misleading .
farage did not bring about brexit all by himself .
they will facilitate interactions across their network to stimulate the development of innovation ecosystems .
the resulting opportunities to expand beyond traditional products and markets will enable pharmaceutical companies to evolve into companies that offer a range of health-care solutions .
these will include not only prescription medicines , but also diagnostics , branded generics , and technologies that support personalized medicine , as well as so-called “ neutraceuticals ” and other “ wellness options . ”
although the size of many r & d organizations is bound to be reduced by such reforms , the complexities of managing and maximizing the impact of this external web of relationships will demand new skills and capabilities over and above those of excellent science .
developing and rewarding employees who possess such skills will be an additional , but welcome , challenge .
economics is not the kind of science in which there could ever be one true model that works best in all contexts .
the point is not “ to reach a consensus about which model is right , ” as romer puts it , but to figure out which model applies best in a given setting .
and doing that will always remain a craft , not a science , especially when the choice has to be made in real time .
the social world differs from the physical world because it is man-made and hence almost infinitely malleable .
so , unlike the natural sciences , economics advances scientifically not by replacing old models with better ones , but by expanding its library of models , with each shedding light on a different social contingency .
today , the agricultural sector accounts for only one-third of total employment in china , compared to one-half in india .
india ’s structural transformation and sustainable growth will hinge on its efforts to build a flexible labor market , centered on the easing of outdated and complicated employment laws .
the legal protections of workers in india ’s formal sector exceed those of most developed countries , as well as china , with mandated requirements rising as the number of employees increases .
as jagdish bhagwati and arvind panagariya have pointed out , excessive labor-market regulations deter indian entrepreneurs from employing unskilled workers and developing labor-intensive manufacturing , implying that the indian government should redouble its reform efforts in this area .
equally important , indian workers – especially young people – need opportunities to upgrade their skills continuously .
the new policy explicitly encourages chinese enterprises to work with local businesses in sectors like logistics , electricity , and information systems , and it promotes interaction among business , community , and government leaders .
equally important , the policy also expands the availability of chinese funding , credits , and insurance to investors .
taken together , this holistic approach is something new for china .
despite considerable political uncertainty in a number of countries in latin america , governments the region appear keen to meet china ’s reform efforts with changes of their own .
for example , brazil ’s government has promoted an “ investment partnerships program ” to coordinate investments in the finance and transportation infrastructure sectors .
eventually , of course , gdp composition will provide the acid test of whether china has succeeded .
but the key word here is “ eventually . ”
it is far too early to expect significant shifts in the major sources of aggregate demand .
for now , it is much more important to examine trends in the potential determinants of chinese consumption .
from this perspective , there is good reason for optimism , especially given accelerated growth in china ’s services sector – one of the key building blocks of a consumer-led rebalancing .
to be sure , the presidency grants trump considerable power to shape trade policy , so one can not ignore the possibility that he will pursue protectionist measures to appease his supporters .
but , ultimately , there is no broad-based support in the us for a return to closed borders .
europe , meanwhile , has been moving in the opposite direction .
european multinationals also have large stakes in the chinese economy , and eu manufacturing exports to china and other emerging markets are now almost double those of the us .
many europeans see trade as an opportunity , rather than as a threat to jobs ; and even europe ’s staunchest anti-globalizers show little appetite for more protectionism .
at the time he took the job , manafort was indebted to the russian oligarch oleg deripaska , an aluminum tycoon close to president vladimir putin , to the tune of $ 19 million .
deripaska , who is subject to us sanctions , had previously maintained a $ 10 million annual contract with manafort .
like other russian oligarchs , deripaska is not known to deal gently with people who displease him .
after he took the job , manafort emailed a ukraine-based employee , “ how do we use [ this ] to get whole ? ”
manafort also offered to brief deripaska about what was going on in the trump campaign .
kyiv – from snowy kyiv , i have watched the successful revolutions in cairo and tunis with joy and admiration .
egyptians and tunisians are right to be proud of their desire to peacefully overthrow despotic governments .
but , as someone who led a peaceful revolution , i hope that pride is tempered by pragmatism , because a change of regime is only the first step in establishing a democracy backed by the rule of law .
indeed , as my country , ukraine , is now demonstrating , after revolutionary euphoria fades and normality returns , democratic revolutions can be betrayed and reversed .
the first of ukraine ’s lessons for egyptian and tunisian democrats is that elections do not a democracy make .
increasingly , we use our fingerprints or our face to unlock our smartphones , pay for purchases , and board airplanes .
the protection against theft is obvious : what use is a phone , car , or ticket that will only work for its legitimate owner ?
above all , biometrics can protect against theft of our identities themselves .
that is the argument behind the world ’s largest biometrics project , a multimodal solution ( iris , fingerprints , and face ) affecting more than one billion indians .
nandan nilekani , the chairman of infosys who left his job to create the system , known as aadhaar , credits it with saving the indian government roughly $ 9 billion by eliminating duplicate and false identities in government beneficiary lists .
pittsburgh – almost six months ago , at a moment of great alarm about the global financial and economic crisis , g-20 leaders met for a historic summit in london .
their collective commitments to stimulate , regulate and restructure global economic activity helped to calm nerves around the world .
many of the problems that spurred the london summit remain real .
anxiety levels may have come down , in board rooms and stock markets , but the daily drama for survival continues . indeed , for many people it has deepened , in the villages and streets of the world ’s least-developed countries – particularly in africa .
the united nations and the world bank predict that the direct and indirect effects of the economic meltdown will be felt in the developing world for a long time to come .
were we observing the look of someone who has intimate knowledge of the catastrophes that are yet to come ?
or was she just the most beautiful girl at the party – the one an avid adolescent had asked to dance , and then held on tightly ?
the world is now collectively writing a new novel .
roth skillfully distilled the tragic and the comic elements of this process , and we spoke of the forces that might be able to stand up to the dark tide of vulgarity and violence under trump .
the first is the sovereign people , who poured into the streets of every large city in the country with the knowledge that , in terms of total votes , it is they , not trump , who won the election .
perhaps simpson has had a change of heart .
perhaps he has traveled his own road to damascus , come face-to-face with what he had done and who he was , repented , and wanted to repair some of the damage to america and its long-run economic growth prospects that he had caused .
even in that case , however , naming those who misbehave to important positions of high trust and acclaiming them as bipartisan statesmen gives the next generation really lousy incentives .
and it ’s not as though congressional republicans think they owe enough to simpson for him to swing a single vote in either chamber of the legislature .
obama officials assured me that simpson had , indeed , had a change of heart ; that he was a smart man with a sophisticated understanding of the issues ; that he could sway reporters and get them to describe the commission ’s advice as “ bipartisan ” ( even though he could not sway actual legislators ) ; and that he would be a genuine asset to the substantive work of the commission .
what demographers call the total fertility rate is the average number of live births per woman over her lifetime .
in the long run , a population is said to be stable if the tfr is at the replacement rate , which is a little above 2.3 for the world as a whole , and somewhat lower , at 2.1 , for developed countries , reflecting their lower infant-mortality rates .
the tfr for most developed countries now stands well below replacement levels .
the oecd average is at around 1.74 , but some countries , including germany and japan , produce less than 1.4 children per woman .
however , the biggest tfr declines in recent years have been in developing countries .
by 2004 , there were more than a billion subscribers to gsm services worldwide .
the global reach of the regulation implied huge economies of scale in the manufacture of handsets and network hardware , so prices fell rapidly , and interoperability between networks and across countries was much easier to achieve .
many regulations play this standard-setting role .
contrary to the simplistic view that regulation is inevitably bad for business , there are in fact three important channels through which regulation can benefit an economy .
one is the market-creating and market-growing role illustrated by the gsm standard .
laguna beach – when i consider the prospects for the global economy and markets , i am taken aback by the extent to which the world has collectively placed a huge bet on three fundamental outcomes : a shift toward materially higher and more inclusive global growth , the avoidance of policy mistakes , and the prevention of market accidents .
though all three outcomes are undoubtedly desirable , the unfortunate reality is that they are far from certain – and bets on them without some hedging could prove exceedingly risky for current and future generations .
the first component of the bet – more inclusive global growth – anticipates continued economic recovery in the united states , with a 3 % growth rate this year bolstered by robust wage growth .
it also assumes china ’s annual growth rate will stabilize at 6.5-7 % , thereby enabling the risks posed by pockets of excessive leverage in the shadow-banking system to be gradually defused , even as the economy ’s growth engines continue to shift from exports and public capital spending toward domestic consumption and private investment .
another , more uncertain assumption underpinning the bet on more inclusive growth is that the eurozone and japan will be able to escape the mire of low growth and avoid deflation , which , by impelling households and businesses to postpone purchasing decisions , would undermine already weak economic performance .
clinton ’s popularity rose after the impeachment proceedings ended .
most americans believed that impeachment was a mistake .
many people worried that the clinton impeachment would damage the presidency , but its main impact on presidential power was the opposite .
republicans eventually agreed with democrats that responsibility for the debacle lay with kenneth starr , the independent counsel whose investigations of clinton ’s real-estate dealings years earlier eventually led him to lewinsky .
the two parties allowed the independent counsel statute to lapse , freeing the presidency from a powerful form of oversight , much to trump ’s benefit a generation later .
most recently , in may 2015 , large numbers of traditional labour voters deserted their party in order to vote for the uk independence party ( ukip ) , which was at the forefront of the brexit campaign .
to be sure , establishment leaders have long been trying to save their own skins by ramping up criticism of the eu , blaming it for demanding that national governments pursue unpopular or failed policies .
but that merely put ideas for alternate policies out of reach , while causing the voters to direct their opposition against the eu itself .
though the establishment parties criticized the eu , for the most part they did not lose sight of the benefits of membership .
indeed , in the uk referendum , both major parties backed the “ remain ” campaign , though they were split internally .
and other emerging economies are not likely to pick up the slack .
brazil , touted in 2010 as an “ emerging aid player , ” is now in economic and political crisis , as is south africa .
these challenges are being compounded for developing countries by new financial regulations in the advanced countries that are hampering flows of investment and finance to the developing world .
weakening developing-economy incomes further is a global demand slowdown and commodities crash , which , as nobel laureate angus deaton has demonstrated , has been disastrous for most of the developing world .
to cap it all off , the expansionary monetary policies adopted by major economies are fueling instability .
pakistan has a large nuclear weapons program and faces an expansive jihadi insurgency , which previously attacked military bases suspected of housing nuclear assets .
though pakistan has not experienced a nuclear breach , and the government insists that safeguards remain robust , the country ’s increasingly frequent and severe bouts of instability raise serious questions about the future .
while north korea ’s nuclear arsenal is much smaller , persistent doubts about the regime ’s sustainability make it a matter of grave concern .
in the event of the regime ’s collapse – a distinct possibility – it would be difficult to prevent the diversion of its assets , or even the use of its weapons .
for its part , iran seems relatively stable , at least compared to its neighbors .
but this was not a us-iran deal ; it was negotiated by six leading powers and endorsed by the united nations .
those powers should make it clear that they will not re-impose sanctions , and that any us attempt to impose its will through extraterritorial measures – say , using access to dollar clearing systems as a foreign-policy tool – would be countered by coordinated action .
for the uk in particular , this may require a willingness to disagree head-on with us foreign policy in a way that some devotees of our “ special relationship ” will find uncomfortable .
as for climate change , the election of a man who purports to believe global warming is a chinese hoax created to damage american business is clearly bad news .
but global momentum to tackle climate change can and must be maintained .
paradoxically , in the pessimistic scenario , iran ’s new government , controlled by conservatives and hardliners , actually fits into the region better than the current one .
after all , saudi arabia , egypt , and many other arab states are also ruled by authoritarian hardliners with little interest in de-escalating regional conflicts .
this would make the resurgence of reform-oriented leadership in iran extremely difficult .
of course , the most likely scenario is a combination of both dynamics .
but , given that it is in everyone ’s interest to ensure that developments hew more closely to the reform-oriented path , it should be clear to all that the diplomatic work with regard to iran is far from complete .
in the aftermath of the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 , italy ’s then-finance minister giulio tremonti famously endorsed the health of the country ’s banking system .
as a result , a major recapitalization of italian banks and the creation of a “ bad bank ” to absorb npls were deemed unnecessary .
ten years later , italy is no longer that imagined land of prosperous banks and happy savers .
the prolonged recession and economic malaise have dented the individual savings rate , while banks no longer have the resources to provide peace of mind to many retail investors , whose trust has been severely eroded .
the implicit pact between banks and savers was broken in late 2015 , when four troubled local banks were bailed in and the shareholders took the hit .
many poles are wary of the church 's equivocal attitude towards democracy , and are allergic to its aggressive presence in politics .
it is a sad paradox , indeed , that for many the ex-communists , in opposing the church , pose as defenders of the liberal democratic values that they once persecuted with unremitting zeal .
kwasniewski ’s strategy of seduction appealed to large numbers of the young and the middle class but most of all to peasants , the unemployed , those left behind by poland 's growing economy .
so the man who spoke a lot about the future rode into power saddled on the votes of the past .
this link will dog kwasniewski 's presidency .
a consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders , but obstacles remain .
perhaps the main risk is that the “ aid bureaucracies ” now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $ 20 billion , so that much of it gets taken up by meetings , expert consultations , overhead , reports , and further meetings .
“ partnerships ” of donors can become an expensive end in themselves , merely delaying real action .
if donor governments really want results , they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places , the most logical being the world bank in washington and the international fund for agricultural development ( ifad ) in rome .
one or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars .
after all , the brics economies are likely to be the most important source of future global growth .
they represent more than a quarter of the earth ’s landmass , over 41 % of its population , almost 25 % of world gdp , and nearly half of all foreign-exchange and gold reserves .
the brics , in fact , might also be dubbed the r-5 , after its members ’ currencies – the real , ruble , rupee , renminbi , and rand .
at the new delhi summit , the brics leaders will discuss the creation of joint institutions , particularly a common development bank that can help to mobilize savings between the countries .
currently , the brics countries constitute a loose , informal bloc .
on the contrary , he must change the conversation to reassure voters that their economic future is bright .
as it stands , the british , like their counterparts elsewhere in europe , feel overtaxed for spotty public services that are constantly being cut , and are angry that their incomes have been falling for the last five years .
as a result , many resent welfare recipients and fear competition for jobs – a sentiment that is fueling the rise of populist , anti-eu , and anti-immigrant parties across europe .
the key difference in the uk is that ukip is gaining ground with voters despite rapid economic growth ( more than 3 % annually , the highest rate in the eu ) .
between now and may , cameron must persuade voters that the british economy will continue to perform strongly , fueling an increase in real incomes .
it is subject to what milton friedman called “ long and variable lags . ”
thus , policies aimed at boosting employment by the end of , say , this calendar year needed to be put in place about a year ago to have time to have reached their full effect .
some countries – china , for example – did , indeed , implement such job-creation policies a year ago and are already seeing the benefits .
others , like the united states , did not , and so unemployment remains at around 10 % .
this is not to say that the obama administration did not try to boost employment .
sectors with a higher human capital content – electronic consumer goods , for example – have much higher r & d costs than the shoe sector , so manufacturing these goods on an assembly line in a low-cost country is probably not very costly in comparison to r & d and other intangible costs .
for more advanced goods , the eu value added ( if the intangible part of the production process is in europe ) is quite high .
imposing trade defense against such goods , even if legally warranted , is likely to create problems for globalized european companies .
many say that these problems are the price to be paid for ensuring that companies do not engage in anti-competitive behavior , or receive trade-distorting subsidies .
but , even if the measures worked as supposed , the majority of trade defense measures are probably not directed against anti-competitive business practices .
motivating corporations to do the right thing is even more difficult .
after all , corporations do n't have a conscience ; it is only the conscience of those who run the corporation , and as america 's recent corporate scandals have made all too clear , conscience often takes a backseat to profits .
america 's legal system makes sure that firms that produce a defective , and particularly an unsafe product , are held liable for the consequences .
firms are in a far better position than consumers to assess the safety of their product ; we all benefit knowing that our legal system has provided corporations with incentives to pay attention to the safety of what they produce .
similarly , environmental laws make firms liable for their toxic wastes , and many countries , including the us , have enshrined the principle that " polluters pay , " that is , companies must pay for the damage they cause .
we do not have to look far for such a mission .
the case for acting on a massive scale to combat climate change has been made in europe , and even in china .
why has there been such little debate in the us ?
is it because those who oppose such discussions reject the science of climate change ?
or do they deny the science because accepting it would legitimize an economically activist state ?
once again , irish voters are poised to vote yes or no to the treaty of nice .
forgotten what that treaty is all about ?
well , it is one of those all-too-frequent late-night compromises reached by eu heads of state and government that seek to slither around and through some practical problems while postponing others .
the compromise reached at nice four years ago is important because it contains , among other provisions , all the technicalities of voting balances and power sharing among eu institutions that must be firmly in place before the union can admit new members .
enlargement is the most important item on the european agenda , and the treaty of nice is its cornerstone .
with the proverbial benefit ( and embarrassment ! ) of hindsight , it is clear that the patterns of growth that occurred over the last half-century were little understood and rarely ( if ever ) forecast by economists .
at the very moment in the 1960s when asia 's tiger economies were beginning to take off , for example , the nobel laureate gunnar myrdal , wrote his the asian drama to diagnose the causes of asian poverty and to explain why its poverty appeared to be ineradicable .
simultaneous to this , a strong consensus developed among economists and policymakers that favored the import substitution policies then being pursued by countries including india , argentina , brazil , egypt and turkey .
after beggaring their adherents , these policies are now utterly discredited .
the key point here is not only that economists got so much wrong , but that almost no one got things right .
but wade postponed legislative elections , originally scheduled for june 2006 , first to february 2007 , and later , by presidential decree , to june 2007 .
two weeks ago there were almost daily discussions about the possibility of the presidential elections being postponed indefinitely .
it now appears that there will be a presidential election , but will it be fair ?
a month before the election , only 64 % of citizens who had registered had received their voting cards .
on january 28 , a peaceful but “ unauthorized ” demonstration by opposition parties was brutally repressed by the police and three presidential candidates were arrested for the day .
princeton , nj - the intersection of genetics and intelligence is an intellectual minefield .
harvard ’s former president larry summers touched off one explosion in 2005 when he tentatively suggested a genetic explanation for the difficulty his university had in recruiting female professors in math and physics .
( he did not suggest that men are on average more gifted in these fields than women , but that there is some reason for believing that men are more likely than women to be found at both the upper and lower ends of the spectrum of abilities in these fields – and harvard , of course , only appoints people at the extreme upper end . )
now one of the most eminent scientists of our time has blundered much more clumsily into the same minefield , with predictable results .
in october , james watson , who shared the 1962 nobel prize for his description of the structure of dna , was in london to promote his memoir , avoid boring people and other lessons from a life in science .
china ’s current president , xi jinping , visited zimbabwe in 2015 .
state visits in the other direction have been more uneven .
mugabe ’s first visit to china was in 1980 , just six months after independence ; he made 13 more during his tenure , and high-level visits by other zimbabwean officials were even more frequent , occurring roughly once every two years during mugabe ’s reign .
kenyan presidents , by contrast , traveled to china just six times during the same period , most recently in may 2017 .
zimbabwe ’s leaders made the most of their visits to press for trade and military cooperation , and likely engaged directly with private chinese companies .
geneva – the world ’s refugee crisis is most often measured in numbers .
but for young refugees missing out on an education , the crisis can also be tracked by an irreversible metric : the passage of time .
of the 17.2 million people that the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( the un refugee agency ) is responsible for protecting , roughly half are under the age of 18 , meaning that an entire generation of young people , already robbed of their childhood , could lose out on a future as well .
school-age children form a large share of the world ’s displaced population .
at the end of 2016 , there were an estimated 11.6 million refugees experiencing “ protracted displacement ” : they have been away from their homes for more than five years and have no “ immediate prospects ” of return .
but how serious are these policy-political crimes to which greenspan now pleads guilty ?
in my view , they are misdemeanors .
against them you have to set what former treasury secretary larry summers calls greenspan ’s “ golden glove ” performance at avoiding and minimizing recessions during his years at the fed .
the “ felonies ” of which greenspan stands accused are the other two charges : that he should have done more to stop the stock market bubble of the late 1990 ’s , and that he should have done more to stop the housing bubble of the early 2000 ’s .
here , greenspan holds his ground , and pleads not guilty .
and it is better to know that history , if we wish to avoid repeating its ugliest scenes .
the truth is that the bds movement is nothing more than a sinister caricature of the anti-totalitarian and anti-apartheid struggles .
it is a campaign whose instigators have no aim other than to discriminate against , delegitimize , and vilify an israel that in their mind never stopped wearing its yellow star .
to activists of good faith who may have been taken in by duplicitous representations of the movement , i would say only that there are too many noble causes in need of assistance to allow oneself to be enlisted in a dubious one .
those worthy causes include fighting the jihadist decapitators , saving the women and girls enslaved by boko haram , defending the middle east ’s imperiled christians and arab democrats , and , of course , striving for a just peace between israelis and palestinians .
it is too soon to discount genetics , however , because the science of “ epigenetics ” – the study of mechanisms for turning genes on and off , thus changing the way a cell develops without altering the genetic code – is gaining traction .
indeed , the 2012 nobel prize in medicine was awarded to john gurdon and shinya yamanaka for revolutionizing scientists ’ understanding of how cells develop by reprogramming dna and cells without altering their genetic structure .
in 1962 , gurdon ’s finding that almost any cell in the body contains the complete dna code enabled him to create a tadpole by cloning an adult frog .
more than four decades later , in 2006 , yamanaka discovered a way to trick complex adult cells in mice into regressing to their immature state , forming stem cells .
before this , stem cells – which can potentially be reprogrammed to develop into replacements for lost or damaged tissue – could be taken only from early-stage embryos , a practice that fueled ethical controversy .
the claims could be prioritized and processed in a regular manner , and the refugees could arrive in europe healthy and ready to work or study .
the crisis in the mediterranean can not be managed in a piecemeal manner .
the financial costs of patrolling its waters and rescuing those adrift are exorbitant .
the loss of lives is inexcusable .
but we do not have to wait until the root causes of displacement – state failure and civil war – are addressed .
according to the most up-to-date estimate by the late economic historian angus maddison , china ’s per capita gdp in 2008 was $ 6,725 in 1990 dollars , which was 21 % of per capita gdp in the united states .
that is roughly the same gap that existed between the us and japan in 1951 , singapore in 1967 , taiwan in 1975 , and south korea in 1977 – four economies that are also among the 13 successful economies studied by the growth commission .
harnessing their latecomer ’s advantage , japan ’s average annual growth rate soared to 9.2 % over the subsequent 20 years , compared to 8.6 % in singapore , 8.3 % in taiwan , and 7.6 % in south korea .
if the latecomer ’s advantage implied by the income gap between the four nies and the us enabled the nies to realize average annual gdp growth rates of 7.6 % -9.2 % for 20 years , china ’s annual growth potential should be a similar 8 % for the 2008-2028 period .
to realize its potential growth as a latecomer , china needs , above all , to deepen its market-oriented reforms , address various structural problems , and develop its economy according to its comparative advantages .
the signatories agreed to conserve biological diversity , by saving species and their habitats , and to use biological resources ( e.g. , forests ) in a sustainable manner .
in 2002 , the treaty ’s signatories went further , committing to “ a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss ” by 2010 .
unfortunately , like so many other international agreements , the convention on biological diversity remains essentially unknown , un-championed , and unfulfilled .
that neglect is a human tragedy .
for a very low cash outlay – and perhaps none at all on balance – we could conserve nature and thus protect the basis of our own lives and livelihoods .
it is because netanyahu is driven by an almost messianic determination to prevent iran from acquiring the means to destroy israel , that he might be amenable to a fundamental change in his position on palestine , provided obama makes visible headway in his drive to stop iran ’s nuclear program .
in netanyahu ’s view , solving the palestinian problem would not remove the iranian challenge ; rather , it is the neutralization of that existential threat that would pave the way to the creation of a palestinian state .
netanyahu also knows that the arab side ’s failures have nurtured radical zionism .
as john kerry , the chairman of the us senate ’s foreign affairs committee , put it , “ this peace process is not a one way street ” in which the onus is put exclusively on israel .
it remains to be seen if the abysmally dysfunctional arab world and the powerful non-state agents in its midst , such as hamas and hezbollah , will respond the way obama expects .
just as the imemo economists predicted , most ( 66 % ) of those who answered this question in moscow thought it was unfair .
but there was a surprise : new york yielded virtually identical results ( 68 % thought it was unfair ) .
so we decided last year to find out whether the same similarity between moscow and new york persists today , or whether , given the revival of authoritarianism in russia today , attitudes toward markets there had become more negative .
we administered the identical questionnaire in the two cities in 2015 .
we presented the results at the american economic association ’s annual meeting this january .
like a dysfunctional family , the northern “ advanced ” countries ponder whether or not to bail out the southern “ emerging ” economies .
the prognoses for each case are starkly different .
in the former version , interest rates converge and the default risk is nil , because , with the ecb backstopping its members ’ liabilities , as the federal reserve does in the us , the euro becomes “ local currency . ”
and how often do we hear about sovereign restructurings of local-currency debt ?
in the latter version of the eurozone , there is differential credit risk and , ultimately , bank runs , de-euroization , and default : the common currency is at odds with the needs of the member states .
republicans therefore have a good chance of creating a conservative majority on the nine-member supreme court that may last for decades , especially if they win the presidency again in 2020 .
that majority may erode democratic checks , such as the campaign-finance limits that were dealt a devastating blow by the 2010 citizens united decision .
in a 5-4 majority , the court ruled that corporations are “ associations of individuals , ” and thus that any limits on the amount of money corporations could spend on political campaigns violated their first amendment right to freedom of expression .
republican obstructionism in the senate has also put other levels of the federal judiciary at risk .
during president barack obama ’s second term in office , the rate at which vacancies in the us district and circuit courts were filled fell to its lowest point in 50 years .
calderon ’s task will not be easy .
lopez obrador and his supporters can be expected to work relentlessly to thwart his plans .
but they are unlikely to derail his government .
the underlying stability highlighted by mexico ’s post-election crisis is also evident elsewhere in latin america .
whatever the potential for a leftward shift this year in some latin american countries , others , including mexico , chile , and brazil , are clearly less vulnerable to the type of populist rule we ’ve seen in venezuela and bolivia .
there is still time to react – by demonstrating strong leadership and prioritizing growth over short-sighted policies – but that time is limited and the clock is ticking .
next year will be crucial , for it will mark the end of the current political cycle and the beginning of a new one .
there will be a new german government , european parliament elections , and , at the end of the year , a new european commission .
it is here that political leaders should devote their efforts .
no one wants the eu to fail because of its citizens ’ disaffection .
colombo – as china ’s economy slows and growth in the developed world remains anemic , governments across asia are working to keep their economies on an upward trajectory .
in sri lanka , where i am prime minister , the challenge is to find a way to accelerate our already steady economic growth .
one thing is clear : we can not expect the rest of the world to welcome our economic ambitions the way it once opened its arms to china ’s rapid rise as an economic power or – in earlier decades – cheered on the growth of japan and the so-called asian tigers , including south korea .
today , we asians are witnessing , on an almost daily basis , fierce political assaults on the tools and policies that have helped lift hundreds of millions of our citizens out of poverty .
indeed , this year , free trade appears to be the scapegoat of choice among the world ’s assorted populists and demagogues .
here is where sunni-shiite cooperation comes in .
widely unnoticed , iraqi sunni and shia centralists have managed in the last couple of months to form a united parliamentary platform that leaves sectarian tensions behind .
more than a hundred followers of ayad allawi , al sadr , and others have joined their ranks .
this supra-sectarian platform calls for a central government administration of iraq ’s natural resources and the postponement of the looming referendum to settle the status of the city of kirkuk .
change within the government is also noteworthy .
political fervor , it seems , has not vanished in the land of rousseau and danton .
so the truth must lie elsewhere : the french are not hopeless about politics ; they are simply waiting for a genuine leader .
as a matter of fact , a case can be made that the french will never come to believe that the state lacks power , globalization or no globalization .
the french still expect greater things from their government than from an integrated europe or the boundless world .
yes , the french are incorrigible lovers of the welfare state ( they are not the only ones ) .
london – next week , governments will gather in warsaw , poland , for a crucial round of climate negotiations , with both expectation and ambition running at an all-time low .
but it does not have to be like this : the warsaw meeting provides an opportunity to galvanize action on one of the most potent forces driving climate change – the billions of dollars spent by governments on fossil-fuel subsidies .
the warsaw talks are a staging post on the route to the 2015 united nations climate summit in paris , at which governments will seek to forge an agreement that prevents dangerous climate change , defined as global warming of more than two degrees celsius .
failure would expose future generations to catastrophic climate risks , while trapping millions of people in poverty as a result of more frequent , intense , and protracted droughts , floods , and storms .
basic carbon arithmetic illustrates the scale of the problem .
in a march 2015 letter to the g-20 , a group of scientists , environmentalists , and opinion leaders warned that ramping up investment in megaprojects risks irreversible and catastrophic damage to the environment .
“ each year , we are already consuming about one-and-a-half planets ’ worth of resources , ” the authors explained .
“ infrastructure choices need to be made to alleviate rather than exacerbate this situation . ”
similarly , the intergovernmental panel on climate change cautions that “ infrastructure developments and long-lived products that lock societies into greenhouse-gas-intensive emissions pathways may be difficult or very costly to change . ”
and , indeed , the g-20 has put in place few social , environmental , or climate-related criteria for the “ wish list ” of mega-projects that each member country will submit to its summit in turkey in november .
for example , the fed has pledged to keep interest rates low at least until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 % – a move that has arguably lowered long-term borrowing costs .
likewise , mark carney , in his first policy action as governor of the bank of england , announced forward guidance for short-term interest rates .
although the effect of such interest-rate guidance on the economy can not be determined without additional data , there are many arguments in its favor .
perhaps the most telling recent example of a central bank using forward guidance effectively was european central bank president mario draghi ’s july 2012 announcement that the ecb would do “ whatever it takes ” to ensure the euro ’s survival .
that pledge alone stabilized borrowing costs and dramatically reduced interest-rate spreads for struggling eurozone countries .
indeed , just the opposite response is likely – efforts to tighten sanctions still further .
yet , just as the us adopted a “ bomb and talk ” approach with the serbs during the dénouement of the bosnian war , america must be willing to “ sanction and talk ” when it comes to iran , thereby creating greater space for an eventual diplomatic strategy .
first , the us should consider establishing diplomatic relations with iran and putting diplomats on the ground .
this would not be an easy process , and could well meet considerable iranian resistance .
but the iranians have diplomatic relations with other members of its main interlocutor in talks on its nuclear program , the sanctions-minded p-5 +1 group ( china , france , germany , russia , the united kingdom , and the us ) , and restoring iran-us diplomatic ties would shorten lines of communications and close the 444-day chapter of 1979-1981 .
anyone watching the ipl , however , might be tempted to conclude that twenty20 cricket , the “ instant ” form of the game , is actually an american game deliberately rediscovered by the indians .
other countries have followed suit , with tournaments modeled on the ipl springing up throughout the cricketing world .
to keen observers , the ipl represented more than a sports league ; it signaled nothing less than the emergence of a new india .
in the ipl ’s glitz , glamour , and excess lay an antidote to the hidebound statist mentality that had produced economic stagnation in india in the past .
here was a venture that opened new vistas for businesses and fired the imaginations of young people to emulate the entrepreneurial energies shown by owners , promoters , players , and fans .
this superficiality results from the fact that , though communism was a thoroughly " modern " notion , modernity in romania goes only skin deep .
at the 20th century ’s close , romania ( like bulgaria , russia , ukraine , and other heavily sovietized societies ) appears more like a ' neo-feudal ' state than a modern society .
for here is a state where groups , classes , even individuals struggle for privileges that are granted , not according to talent and work , but rather according to the status of the group in which one belongs .
state banks , state approved public societies ( trade unions , for example ) , large state enterprises , act little differently in romania today than feudal guilds behaved in medieval europe .
at the whim of the state , for example , they can be exonerated from paying taxes , or have their posts and work made unchallengeable by law .
on the other hand , diplomatic means may bring about the release of the israeli soldier and put a stop to the firing of qassam rockets from gaza into israel – a daily occurrence that has challenged the credibility of the new israeli government under prime minister ehud olmert .
but the fundamental problem is that , until now , at every historical juncture , the palestinians refused to accept a compromise and consequently failed in nation-building .
in 1947 , they refused the un partition plan , which called for the establishments of two states in british palestine .
in 1993 , after the oslo agreements , the palestinian authority established under yasir arafat became another militarized authoritarian regime , very much like syria and egypt , and did nothing to alleviate the suffering of the palestinian refugees .
it was this failure that brought hamas to power .
in asia , indonesia may look “ european ” in its obama craze , but it essentially constitutes an anomaly , easily explainable by obama ’s brief indonesian upbringing .
otherwise , and for very different reasons , a majority of asian elites are awaiting the growing possibility of an obama victory with some bewilderment and even apprehension .
for example , japanese elites tend to favor continuity over change .
in their mind , the hard power of the united states is more important than its soft power , and their vision of an america “ bound to lead ” is largely unchanged .
for them , the us is above all the strategic counterweight needed to balance china .
canberra – last year , north korea ’s kim jong-un and us president donald trump were hurling kindergarten insults at each other – “ rocket man is on a suicide mission , ” said trump of kim ; “ mentally deranged us dotard , ” kim retorted – while threatening to reduce east asia to a post-atomic wasteland .
now , in a stunning and dramatic development , the two are to meet by may .
kim reportedly is willing to denuclearize and eager to talk directly to trump , who has agreed .
but optimism about this turn of events must be tempered with cautious realism .
north korea is the nuclear problem from hell .
nepad , the new partnership for africa ’s development , an organization designed to promote decent and appropriate standards of economic and political development throughout the continent , has been at the core of this policy .
despite its domestic problems and the loss of global visibility that accompanied mandela ’s retirement , south africa is still perceived as an emerging power comparable in status and aspiration to , say , brazil , india , and nigeria .
such powers seek an effective and constructive regional role , and possibly , in some instances , a global one .
they tend to have proactive and assertive foreign policies and aspire to more than the middle-power status and limited niche-style influence enjoyed by canada , sweden , or saudi arabia .
south africa seeks a wider and more influential role reinforced by its obvious standing as a regional hegemon .
it aspires to join the european union , and would bring the eu to our three borders , even as we , too , aspire to join one day .
indeed , turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker .
immediately after the collapse of the soviet union , turkey proposed the black sea economic cooperation .
this year , as the american-led effort to mediate a middle east peace settlement began to falter , turkey took up the job of mediator in both the israeli-palestinian conflict and the conflict between syria and israel .
now , in the immediate wake of the russia-georgia crisis , turkey ’s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the caucasus .
indeed , across the region , apprehension is growing that when foreign troops leave , afghanistan will again descend into civil war , ultimately bringing the taliban back to power .
that is why “ bringing the troops home early ” has become the prime objective of western politicians who are engaged in the region .
the west needs to get out before the bloodletting starts again in earnest .
my fear is that we have not seen the last of al qaeda or the taliban .
as a neighboring country , india would face disturbing consequences if they returned to power in afghanistan , as would iran , which would not sit idly by if sectarian strife intensified and the shia became targets of a resurgent taliban .
and governments must respond to the banks ’ threats by declaring their willingness to let insolvent banks be judged accordingly .
a market economy must rest on the economic principle of profit and loss .
an economy with neither bankruptcies nor a rule of law that applies equally to all is no market economy .
the law that is valid for all other companies should apply to banks as well .
moreover , governments should guarantee insolvent banks ’ loans to non-financial companies , as well as private customers ’ current , fixed-term , and savings deposits , by reforming insolvency laws .
but the gross flow of capital is from emerging market to emerging market , through big banks now implicitly backed by the state in both the us and europe .
from the perspective of international investors , banks that are “ too big to fail ” are the perfect places to park their reserves – as long as the sovereign in question remains solvent .
but what will these banks do with the funds ?
when a similar issued emerged in the 1970 ’s – the so-called “ recycling of oil surpluses ” – banks in western financial centers extended loans to latin america , communist poland , and communist romania .
that was not a good idea , as it led to a massive ( for the time ) debt crisis in 1982 .
when they give way , disease , despair and death rush in .
but the plagues of transition are more than a health crisis ; they signify a deeper malaise .
so put aside the fact that these diseases are infectious and can easily spread , or the idea that the fortunate bear some moral responsibility for the welfare of the poor and sick , and merely consider the economic consequences of the plagues of transition .
the world bank calls aids “ the foremost threat to african development . ”
companies in south africa stagger from losing so many workers to aids .
but while it would be a strategic error for erdoğan to enter putin ’s orbit , plenty of leaders have made strategic errors before .
that is why the next few months , when turkey and the eu hash out contentious issues , are so critical .
erdoğan ’s post-coup crackdown is far from the only source of tension between turkey and the west , particularly the eu .
turkey insists that visa-free travel for turkish citizens visiting the eu , promised by eu governments in january , should be delivered this year .
but , with turkey having so far failed to meet the agreed conditions , including overhauling its anti-terrorism legislation , that may not happen – an outcome made even more likely by the coup attempt .
as long as the palestinians are oppressed and denied a nation-state of their own , there will be conflict .
nonetheless , over the past 13 years , netanyahu has enthusiastically supported the expansion of jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem .
as he well knows , the settlements are a physical roadblock standing in the way of a contiguous , independent palestinian state .
moreover , during the recent election campaign , netanyahu pledged that , if re-elected , he would prevent the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank by “ controlling the entire area . ”
we should take him at his word .
it had failed to prevent the money supply from contracting in the early stages of the great depression .
heedless of its responsibilities as an emergency lender , it had allowed the banking system to collapse .
when financial stability hung in the balance in 1933 , the reserve banks ' failure to cooperate prevented effective action .
given such incompetence , it is not surprising that subsequent reforms were far-reaching .
but these reforms went in precisely the opposite direction from today 's proposed changes : fewer limits on policy makers ' discretion , more power to the board , and a larger role for the new york fed , all to enable the federal reserve system to react more quickly and robustly in a crisis .
pittsburgh – the wall street journal recently ran a front-page article reporting that the monetary-policy “ doves , ” who had forecast low inflation in the united states , have gotten the better of the “ hawks , ” who argued that the fed ’s monthly purchases of long-term securities , or so-called quantitative easing ( qe ) , would unleash faster price growth .
the report was correct but misleading , for it failed to mention why there is so little inflation in the us today .
were the doves right , or just lucky ?
the us federal reserve board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves , but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth .
neither the hawks nor the doves ( nor anyone else ) expected that .
by reducing the rate of unwanted pregnancies , family planning also decreases the number of deaths from unsafe abortions .
this is not only good for mothers .
reducing high-risk pregnancies , curbing unwanted pregnancies , and spacing out births have been shown to decrease newborn and child death rates .
the guttmacher institute estimates that fully meeting women ’s need for contraception would prevent 600,000 newborn deaths and 500,000 child deaths annually .
moreover , cutting birth rates , which are very high in many lmics , would help to reduce the strain on these countries ’ health-care systems by diminishing the costs of maternal and newborn care and immunization .
the saudis are also recoiling under a barrage of criticism of their wahhabi brand of islam , which is widely blamed for incubating extremism and inspiring terrorism .
meanwhile , saudi arabia ’s human rights record – including the denial of elementary rights for women – is under constant scrutiny .
against this background , the kingdom is taking the fight to its enemies .
king salman bin abdulaziz al saud is the country ’s above-the-fray ruler , but his son , prince mohammad bin salman al saud , currently wields much of the power .
as minister of defense , mohammad has continued the saudi policy of backing anti-assad rebels in syria , in concert with turkey , while unleashing a war on pro-iranian tribesmen in yemen ( at an enormous humanitarian cost ) .
the answer to the first question is both yes and no .
the us has failed to eliminate the taliban from afghanistan and entirely rule out the possibility of the country again becoming a haven for terrorists .
the ongoing peace talks with the taliban and the impending reduction of the us military presence in the country are a clear recognition of this .
the american public is war-weary and president donald trump is keen to declare an end to the longest international conflict in us history before the 2020 presidential election .
at the same time , the us achieved many of its initial core objectives .
emerging-market officials will earn accreditation by demonstrating the ability to apply their knowledge practically .
the ebrd aims to support the training of a critical mass of experts from ten countries in our region , and we believe that the certificate could become as respected as the qualification held by a chartered financial analyst or a member of the project management institute .
just five months ago in london , we hosted a “ ppp days ” conference with the support of other multilateral institutions , the g-20 , and the united nations .
we had plenty of experts – some 300 from the public and private sectors of 30 countries – attempting to provide an answer to a simple question : “ what would it take to double private infrastructure investment in emerging markets ? ”
one useful tool in the effort is “ infrascope , ” a benchmarking index created by the economist intelligence unit that assesses the capacity of emerging-market countries across the asia-pacific region , latin america , africa , eastern europe , and the former soviet republics in the commonwealth of independent states to deliver sustainable ppps .
the us efforts , led by special envoy george mitchell , have shown clearly that the current ruling coalition in israel is incapable of doing the minimum required for peace .
the obama administration staked its reputation on getting israelis and palestinians to agree at least on security and borders .
the results are mixed , at best .
palestinians complied with all israeli and international requirements for security , while binyamin netanyahu ’s israeli government , which gives lip-service to the two-state solution , has yet to elucidate where israel ’s borders will be .
meanwhile , the israeli government wants to continue building settlements in occupied areas , in total violation of international law and the minimum requirements for peace detailed in the “ roadmap ” sponsored by the quartet ( the us , un , european union , and russia ) .
then , contagion sets in , as increasingly risk-averse investors , particularly short-term investors from developed-country markets , begin to withdraw funds from other countries to cover losses they incurred in the economies where the crises originated .
with that , the crises spill across borders , affecting whole regions or even the entire class of emerging economies .
that is what happened in latin america in the 1980s , when mexico ’s moratorium on external debt servicing in august 1982 sparked a region-wide debt crisis .
the same thing occurred in east asia in the 1990s : the crisis began in thailand in july 1997 with the collapse of the baht , and quickly spread to other east asian countries .
it became a broad-based emerging-economy crisis in august 1998 , after russia imposed a moratorium on payments by commercial banks to foreign creditors .
as a result , prominent economists , including senior staff at the international monetary fund , have become increasingly critical of oda in recent years , claiming failure to contribute to economic growth .
but un research clearly shows that if blatantly politically driven aid is excluded from consideration , the evidence points to a robust positive relationship .
unfortunately , despite recent efforts to enhance aid effectiveness , progress has been modest at best , not least because average financing for projects has fallen by more than two-thirds .
debt is another side of the development dilemma .
over the last decade , the joint imf-world bank heavily indebted poor countries initiative and its extension , the supplementary multilateral debt relief initiative , have made significant progress on debt sustainability .
denver – for many foreign audiences , the united states ’ primary elections for the 2012 presidential vote – which will , alas , continue to rage into the summer – must be a frightening display of what americans and their leaders do not know about foreign policy .
debate after debate reveals the fact that none of the candidates seeking to challenge president barack obama is particularly interested in the details of any of america ’s relationships around the globe , not to mention the crises that dot the international landscape , especially those that do not involve us troops .
indeed , ignorance seems to be a source of strength for the candidates still in the race .
when jon huntsman , an early contender , displayed some real intellectual heft by making a few useful points about dealing with china , punctuated by a brief display of his own mastery of mandarin , some other candidates responded with derision .
to have even known the chinese perspective seems to have been disqualifying for huntsman , who soon ended his candidacy .
i helped launch the first safe schools initiative , following boko haram ’s abduction of 276 schoolgirls in chibok , nigeria , last april .
a fund has so far mobilized $ 30 million from businesses , the nigerian government , and international donors , and a multi-donor trust fund has been established at the un .
nigeria ’s initiative focuses on school and community interventions , with special measures for the most at-risk and vulnerable children .
the agenda includes building better school fortifications , linking schools to police stations by mobile telecommunications , and creating community security groups – consisting of teachers , parents , police , community leaders , and young people themselves – to promote safe zones for education .
the first set of schools has now received funding , and the first cohort of the most at-risk girls has been relocated to government schools in safer regions of the country .
luxembourg – as world leaders gather in madrid for the united nations climate change conference ( cop25 ) , they must address more than future targets for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions .
they must also address the harm to people and livelihoods that climate change is already causing .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
this favorable performance led private forecasters and government officials to predict continued strong growth in 2011 , with higher production , employment , and incomes leading to further increases in consumer spending and a self-sustaining recovery .
a one-year cut of the payroll tax rate by two percentage points was enacted in order to lock in this favorable outlook .
unfortunately , the projected recovery in consumer spending did n’t occur .
the rise in food and energy prices outpaced the gain in nominal wages , causing real average weekly earnings to decline in january , while the continued fall in home prices reduced wealth for the majority of households .
as a result , real personal consumer expenditures rose at an annual rate of just about 1 % in january , down from the previous quarter ’s 4 % increase .
instead , we are left with the usual microeconomic measures to prepare people for algorithmic employment – that is , the use of big data to match people with the jobs they will need to remain consumers .
again , we are told that future labor-market participants should be equipped with job-targeted education and portable social-security pots to help them jump from one automated workplace to another .
in the case of education , the report calls on employers and colleges to work together to develop talent “ pipelines . ”
for example , it highlights miami dade college ’s “ programs in animation and game development , working with companies such as pixar animation studios and google . ”
likewise , toyota “ has built its own advanced manufacturing technician program to provide a pathway for students seeking careers at the company . ”
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
last year ’s united nations report on progress toward achieving the sdgs showed that the number of people facing hunger is actually growing , as is the number of malaria cases .
moreover , according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change , the consequences of climate change are emerging much faster than anticipated .
québec will invest more than $ 3.3 billion toward this goal by 2020 , contributing to the growth of its economy .
the basque country established a program called local agenda 21 , designed to support the creation of local sustainability plans across the region .
as a result of the program , almost all basque municipalities have adopted such plans , consisting of more than 25,000 projects in areas such as mobility , waste management , and economic development .
these local plans are now driving sustainable development in the region , with knowledge sharing among municipalities laying the foundation for further progress .
south australia , meanwhile , has developed the most supportive regulatory framework for renewable energy investment in australia , enabling an increase in renewables ’ share in power generation from virtually zero in 2003 to almost 40 % today .
in the 1930 ’s , the countries that raised their tariffs and tightened their quotas the most were those with the least ability to manage their exchange rates – namely , countries that remained on the gold standard .
in 1931 , after britain and some two dozen other countries suspended gold convertibility and allowed their currencies to depreciate , countries that stuck to the gold standard found themselves in a deflationary vice .
in a desperate effort to do something – anything – to defend their economies , they turned to protectionism , imposing “ exchange-rate dumping ” duties , and import quotas to offset the loss of competitiveness caused by their own increasingly overvalued currencies .
but trade restrictions were a poor substitute for domestic reflationary measures , as they did little to arrest the downward spiral of output and prices .
they did nothing to stabilize rickety banking systems .
madrid – since its inception in oslo almost two decades ago , the israeli-palestinian peace process has been stymied by the dysfunctional political systems of both sides .
hostage of an impossible coalition and of a settlement movement of free-lance fanatics , israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu ’s leadership is seriously compromised .
his palestinian counterparts are hardly in a better position .
today , the clique that surrounds palestinian president mahmoud abbas embodies the bitter deception which the peace process that began with the oslo agreement has meant for the palestinians .
moreover , the palestinian authority has come neither to represent the majority of palestinians nor to rule by democratic means .
this has contributed to a growing sense of hopelessness – particularly among men – which has manifested in rising non-participation in the workforce , aggravated health problems , drug abuse , elevated suicide rates , and anti-government sentiment .
countries that experience high and rising economic inequality often face political instability and policy dysfunction .
as policymaking becomes erratic , loses credibility , and becomes choked by gridlock , growth suffers , and the chances of achieving a prosperous form of inclusiveness decline .
the result is a vicious circle , in which government finds it increasingly difficult to do what is needed .
but government intervention is crucial to tackle the problems facing developed-country workers today , which markets ca n’t address alone .
the tribe can be a club , a clan , or a nation .
before world war ii , football clubs often had an ethnic or religious component : tottenham hotspur in london was “ jewish , ” while arsenal was “ irish . ”
vestiges of these markings remain : ajax of amsterdam is still taunted by provincial opponents as the “ jew club . ”
and the glasgow clubs , celtic and rangers , are still divided by religious affiliation , celtic being catholic and rangers protestant .
but a common race or religion is not essential .
it is also about spending more equitably .
in a new report to be launched at the imf-world bank spring meetings , save the children documents a glaring gap between health risks , which are heavily skewed toward the poorest children , and the benefits of public spending , are often skewed in favor of better-off households .
this flies in the face of a central pledge governments made when they signed on to the sdgs : that those countries furthest from the targets would benefit from the fastest progress .
in the language of the agenda , “ no one should be left behind . ”
the world bank could help improve accountability for fulfilling that commitment by working with the un and national agencies to monitor and report on the pace at which disparities in key indicators , from mortality to education , are being narrowed .
two examples suffice to illustrate the impact : the price of rice has tripled while consumption of electricity is down by two-thirds from two decades ago .
my personal memories of north korea , now almost ten years old , are of a poor and depressed country .
pyongyang , the capital , was dark and deserted , illuminated by the cavalcade taking us from the official housing to the opera house , only to return to darkness behind us .
kim jong-il was greeted with the same fervor when he entered the opera house that today marks public mourning of his death .
my trip took place in april 2002 , a somewhat optimistic time .
but there are other gender targets to consider .
the best way to reduce violence against women , lift them out of poverty , and empower them to be full and equal members of society is to break the cycle of early marriage and childbirth .
such a large change is not easy to achieve , but if girls can stay in school longer and have decent job opportunities available to them after they graduate , they are likely to marry and bear children later .
for example , in rural india , recruiters for well-paid back-office jobs visited randomly selected villages over a period of three years .
female employment rose and women aged 15-21 were 5-6 % less likely to get married or give birth over this period .
vice foreign minister kim kye-gwan delivered the north ’s furious response : “ we do not hide our feeling of repugnance toward him . ”
the north was not interested in a dialogue aimed at a coerced “ unilateral nuclear abandonment . ”
the “ world knows too well that our country is neither libya nor iraq , which have met miserable fates . ”
although trump distanced himself from bolton ’s remarks , vice president mike pence warned three weeks later that if north korea did not make a deal , it would indeed meet with libya ’s fate .
choe son hui , vice minister of foreign affairs , replied by threatening a “ nuclear-to-nuclear showdown ” if washington stuck to “ unlawful and outrageous ” belligerence .
after almost 15 years of unprecedented growth - interrupted only by a brief slowdown in 2000-2001 - the united states has accumulated a huge stock of foreign liabilities , equivalent to 25 % of its gdp .
with the current account deficit now exceeding 5 % of gdp , us foreign debt is rising fast .
but no country can accumulate debt forever - and what can not last sooner or later must end .
in early 1985 , when the us current account deficit reached $ 120 billion , about a third of today 's level at current prices , the rest of the world stopped financing it .
the outcome was a sudden fall in the value of the dollar , which depreciated by 50 % against the deutschemark .
princeton – the united states has moved from the high of a presidential election to the low of a political sex scandal in one short week .
for many americans , the election demonstrated what is best about the country , only to be followed by the sadly familiar process of knocking heroes off their pedestals .
for many non-americans , the election brought the welcome and reassuring victory of barack obama , whereas the resignation of david petraeus as director of the cia was an unnecessary , self-inflicted wound .
in fact , both the election and petraeus ’s resignation are pieces of a larger whole : an america that lives up to its promises .
the election reminded many americans that the us is a country committed to and capable of progress – of moving forward toward an ideal vision .
the first casualty would be whatever small scope remains for international policy coordination .
the second would be the world international monetary system .
in fact , one key reason for the creation of the international monetary fund was to monitor exchange-rate developments with the explicit aim of preventing beggar-thy-neighbor policies .
this is why the swiss move comes as a surprise .
it is true that the franc has appreciated in real terms by 8 % since the crisis started in august 2007 .
the call by björn höcke , the afd ’s state leader in thuringia , for an “ 180-degree turn ” from the post-world war ii tradition of atoning for the crimes of the nazi era , and afd deputy leader alexander gauland ’s reference to “ disposing of ” germany ’s integration minister of turkish origin “ in anatolia , ” repelled voters .
likewise , die linke ’s call to abolish nato , together with its cozying up to russia , has left the party politically toxic in most of western germany .
the second commonly cited cause of germany ’s resilience to populism is its economic strength .
the country ’s unemployment rate is currently at a record low , and gdp has grown by nearly 10 % since 2013 .
add to that a functioning welfare system , and it is clear why the inequality-focused outrage that has fueled voter revolts elsewhere is gaining little traction in germany .
enormous fines were imposed on independent publications , broadcasters , and bloggers .
china and turkey – both olympic-level jailers of journalists – have ramped up their repression in recent years .
just last month , russian president vladimir putin signed new laws authorizing punishment of individuals and online media for spreading so-called fake news and information that “ disrespects ” the state .
us president donald trump is trying to go in the same direction .
his constant branding of journalists as “ liars ” and “ enemies of the people ” echoes the nazis ’ preferred label for the media : the lügenpresse ( lying press ) .
without the benefits of trade , much of rural africa struggles at subsistence levels .
bush might think that america is doing a lot to help overcome these problems , but the truth is that us aid is minimal .
blair ’s africa commission , as well as the un millennium project , found that africa needs about $ 50 billion per year in aid by 2010 .
america ’s fair share of the total is about $ 15 billion per year .
yet official us aid to africa is only $ 3 billion per year , and much of that covers salaries for american consultants rather than investments in africa ’s needs .
north korea is now the ninth state with nuclear weapons , joining the five permanent members of the un security council , israel , india , and pakistan .
the danger is that we may fast be approaching a tipping point .
how the world responds to north korea is likely to affect the calculations of other would-be nuclear powers , including iran .
maintaining peace in a world in which literally dozens of fingers are on nuclear triggers will be far more difficult — and the consequences of failure far more destructive .
initial reactions to north korea ’s nuclear test were uniformly critical , culminating ( thus far ) in un security council resolution 1718 , which condemns the test , demands that north korea resume full cooperation with the international atomic energy agency , and imposes a range of military , political , and economic sanctions .
industrialist wilbur ross , the commerce secretary-designate , has been vocal in his desire to abrogate america ’s “ dumb ” trade deals .
peter navarro , an economics professor at the university of california at irvine , will be the director of the national trade council – a new white house policy shop to be set up on a par with the national security council and the national economic council .
navarro is one of america ’s most extreme china hawks .
the titles of his two most recent books – death by china ( 2011 ) and crouching tiger : what china ’s militarism means for the world ( 2015 ) – speak volumes about his tabloid-level biases .
ross and navarro were also co-authors of an economic-policy position paper published on the trump campaign website that stretched any semblance of credibility .
but , because policymakers constantly threatened to end qe , markets inferred that the ecb was not committed to a sustained stimulus .
the euro-dollar exchange rate thus barely moved ; in fact , the euro appreciated against a basket of major currencies .
eurozone inflation became “ de-anchored ” from monetary-policy decisions .
the ecb then declared victory and prematurely withdrew qe just as the eurozone economy was slowing down .
the clash of interests among eurozone member states is straightforward .
experience suggests that importing laws and legal standards rarely works well .
for centuries , western law arrived with colonial rulers .
even after europe ’s empires retreated , laws were still exported in order to foster development in post-colonial countries .
in many cases , however , these imported laws were ignored , selectively enforced , or were complied with only in form , not substance .
american antitrust law , when transplanted to japan after world war ii by general macarthur , for example , led to only six criminal prosecutions in thirty years .
but other firms have been accused of having more interest in developing a “ biobank ” of samples and data than in genetic testing .
as jesse reynolds of the center for genetics and society writes , “ just as the traditional business model of newspapers is to get revenue not from readers but from advertisers , personal genomics companies see the potential profit not from the consumers themselves but from the compiled databases – likely in the form of selling access to them . ”
drug companies and other firms may well be eager to buy biobanks on which they can test their products for differential responses according to patients ’ genetic make-up .
this new development , called “ pharmacogenetics , ” aims to deliver better-calibrated dosages and more effective treatments .
there is certainly nothing wrong with that , but it does seem odd that customers are effectively paying a firm for the privilege of donating their dna to its database .
european banks holding greek government debt could keep pretending that it is worth its full value .
and the european central bank would have fewer excuses to refuse greek bonds as collateral .
the question is whether the change in coupons – possibly coupled with an extension of maturities – would be enough to stabilize the greek economy and restore growth .
even with german-level interest rates , greece would have to run a primary surplus of at least 2 % of gdp – still quite large , and far from today ’s deficit .
and , with the face value of the debt unchanged , the psychological drag on expectations and investment might linger .
excessive fiscal and monetary expansion made these economies unstable .
current-account deficits grew , resulting in frequent foreign-exchange crises .
the combination of social polarization , inadequate institutions , and weak economic fundamentals has made it difficult for even reform-minded governments to escape the trap of short-termism and lay the groundwork for long-term development .
in this context , “ neoliberal ” reforms – such as the rapid economic opening and financial liberalization promoted by the international monetary fund – made economies even more vulnerable to external shocks .
venezuela is a case in point .
movies produced for the sexual gratification of consumers reveal cultural norms of restriction , transgression , and otherness .
in fact , porn is so specifically tuned to the tastes of consumers that shifts can indicate changes in a society almost immediately .
interestingly , many purveyors of pornography initially thought that better quality video would make their product more desirable .
however , it seems that high production values were actually less popular .
so a “ casual ” production style was adopted , similar to the design of worn and ripped jeans .
but he never aspired to lead a country .
former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and former thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra did – and still do .
neither the clown nor the tycoon is well suited to being a democratic leader .
the question is which is worse .
clowns have always played a role in politics .
eventually , the cities and urban areas that are driving the bulk of new wealth creation will provoke a counter-movement .
if they price out or otherwise exclude those who earn less , they will have sacrificed the openness that made them attractive in the first place .
so , if they want to survive and thrive in today ’s egalitarian political climate , they will need to come up with bold solutions .
during a previous period of urban-based dynamism , in the early sixteenth century , rich merchant families built low-rent housing that was then allocated to the poor .
one such project , the fuggerei complex in augsburg , germany , still provides low-rent social housing to this day .
georges clémenceau , jean jaurès , and raymond poincaré , at the outset of the twentieth century , did not pander to the nearly half of the electorate that , during the dreyfus affair , had exiled themselves from the republic .
nor did charles de gaulle have any qualms about telling the proponents of french algeria that , in the end , he did not understand them .
nor did pierre mendès france in the 1950s hesitate to tell the communists that he did n’t want their votes to support his government .
france must now recall these great moments in its republican tradition and hold them up as a model for today ’s leaders .
for what will be needed to hold the territory that the republic nearly lost to the fn is political courage of a sort that , for the moment , is in short supply .
and we know that those landings created a unique bond between our continents .
that bond remains vital for the preservation of our values and our security .
but , after the cold war , many assumed that its institutional embodiment – the north atlantic treaty organization – would fade away .
it did not , because our bond is based not just on common threats , but on shared ideals .
it could no more fade away than our desire for freedom could wane .
china does itself no favors by remaining time-warped in the maoist 1960 ’s when discussing this issue .
the chinese have been so smart in so many areas .
they devised the “ one country , two systems ” formula for hong kong .
is it really beyond the capacity of their political system to work out a formula for tibet that recognizes its cultural and religious autonomy within the chinese state ?
i hope that this issue does not derail the chinese effort to use the olympics as an opportunity to show the world that their country has emerged again as one of the world ’s leaders .
sarajevo – ever since the double disasters of 2016 – the united kingdom ’s brexit referendum and us president donald trump ’s election – there has been widespread anxiety about a “ global wave ” of populism , and hand-wringing over the follies of so-called direct democracy .
in the uk , the electorate was asked to answer an overly simplistic in-or-out question ; in the united states , the 2016 republican party primaries were handed over to irresponsible voters and radical activists .
since then , there have been calls to re-empower the “ gatekeepers , ” which is a polite way of saying that the unwashed masses should be kept as far away from political decision-making as possible .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
berkeley – to solve a problem , it is not enough to know what to do .
you actually have to implement the solution – and be willing to change course if it turns out that you did not know quite as much as you thought .
that is the message of two recent books that , together , tell you everything you need to know about the 2008 financial crisis : what caused it , what can be done to prevent it from recurring , and why those things have yet to be done .
the first book is the shifts and the shocks , by the conservative british journalist martin wolf , who begins by cataloguing the major shifts that set the stage for the economic disaster that continues to shape the world today .
his starting point is the huge rise in wealth among the world ’s richest 0.1 % and 0.01 % and the consequent pressure for people , governments , and companies to take on increasingly unsustainable levels of debt .
this has its benefits , but it also carries serious risks – beginning with the loss of journalistic standards of excellence , like those typically enforced within established media organizations .
without traditional institutional media gatekeepers , political discourse is no longer based on a common set of facts .
the second feature of the digital information age – a direct byproduct of democratization – is information socialization .
rather than receiving our information directly from institutional gatekeepers , who , despite often-flawed execution , were fundamentally committed to meeting editorial standards , today we acquire it via peer-to-peer sharing .
such peer networks may elevate content based on factors like clicks or engagement among friends , rather than accuracy or importance .
moreover , heavy tv viewing has contributed to social fragmentation .
time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen .
robert putnam , the leading scholar of america ’s declining sense of community , has found that tv viewing is the central explanation of the decline of “ social capital , ” the trust that binds communities together .
americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago .
of course , many other factors are at work , but television-driven social atomization should not be understated .
in fact , this dangerous and irresponsible action is yet another key sign that china ’s rise as a global power lacks any guarantee that it will be a peaceful nation once it grows strong .
it flatly contradicts the repeated assurances of china ’s leaders that china ’s rise will bring only “ harmony ” and peace to the international community .
lurking behind china ’s ambition in space is the spirit of the cold war , which continues to permeate the inner circles of the military high command , whose adversary is unmistakably the united states .
with the collapse of the soviet communist regime , the us continues to enjoy a dominant role in space exploration for peaceful and scientific development .
but since the 1980 ’s , the us has been ambivalent about the ultimate military and civilian utility of its space efforts .
illegality and wrongdoing were artfully cloaked as an incontrovertible , science-tested natural law , " the survival of the fittest . "
every time a new , powerful scientific formulation appears , it must go through a period of abusive application .
today , it is the turn of molecular genetics .
temperament , obesity , heart disease , intelligence , homosexuality or criminal behavior : everything is said to reside in the genes .
distinguished scientists proclaim that our very destiny is inscribed on the dna molecule , and science-popularizers join the exultant choir , asserting that human beings are nothing but " programmed " entities .
around its picturesque squares , every cobblestone and ornamental façade has borne silent witness to the bloodletting that accompanied empires ’ rise and fall .
yet lviv is also where one can find hope for the promise of europe .
lviv is a deeply anti-russian and pro-european city ; but , for five days each summer , it hosts the alpha jazz festival , sponsored by a russian bank .
at a time when russia and ukraine are still very much at war , policymakers , local citizens , members of the ukrainian diaspora , and even some russians pack the streets of lviv to celebrate world-class jazz .
beyond its vital cultural life and geographical location , ukraine is strategically important to the west .
palo alto – it is still too soon to gauge the full economic impact of president barack obama ’s implemented and proposed policies , but a preliminary read indicates limited short-term benefit at large long-term cost .
the administration is exploiting a crisis atmosphere to enact a vast agenda that would reengineer the american economy , from autos and financial services to health care , energy , and the distribution of income .
obama outsourced the details of the $ 787 billion fiscal stimulus to congress and , no surprise , the old barons of the house stuffed it with pork and social engineering .
several months later , only 4 % -6 % of the funds have been spent , and the federal government is brow-beating state governments – for example , demanding that california rescind a small pay cut for some unionized workers or lose $ 7 billion in stimulus funds .
( intervening in contractual relations ex post to enforce union demands is an emerging characteristic of the administration ) .
as europeans well know , there is no way to build a wall in the mediterranean .
moreover , it is worrying that the trump administration hardly ever talks about upholding the post-war liberal international order .
instead , it views the world as a zero-sum strategic competition in which the us should look out only for itself .
unfortunately , in a world without common institutions to restrain sovereign states from escalating conflicts with one another , the risks of all-out war will increase substantially .
to be sure , the us says that it is stepping up its commitment to european security .
the old model served both sides well for three decades .
china ’s growth was driven by labor-intensive exports made more competitive by transfers of technology and knowledge from the us and other western countries .
this , coupled with massive chinese public and private investment ( enabled by high – and recently excessive – savings ) , underpinned rising incomes for millions of chinese .
the us consumer , meanwhile , benefited greatly from declining relative prices of manufactured goods in the tradable side of the economy .
accordingly , us employment shifted to higher-value-added activities , in turn supporting higher incomes in america , too .
a profound change in us strategic priorities under president donald trump demands that europeans revisit long-held assumptions about their collective defense .
this is not the first time that nato has seemed to be on its last legs .
many had arrived at the same conclusion before 2014 , when the alliance had little to focus on beyond the mission in afghanistan .
when russia annexed crimea and brought war to eastern ukraine , it breathed new life into nato .
then came trump , whose administration has pulled the rug out from under europe ’s feet , abandoned american leadership within the rules-based international system , and pursued a nationalist , protectionist , and unilateralist foreign policy .
first , the fiscal-stimulus policies that are currently pushing the annual us growth rate above its 2 % potential are unsustainable .
by 2020 , the stimulus will run out , and a modest fiscal drag will pull growth from 3 % to slightly below 2 % .
second , because the stimulus was poorly timed , the us economy is now overheating , and inflation is rising above target .
the us federal reserve will thus continue to raise the federal funds rate from its current 2 % to at least 3.5 % by 2020 , and that will likely push up short - and long-term interest rates as well as the us dollar .
meanwhile , inflation is also increasing in other key economies , and rising oil prices are contributing additional inflationary pressures .
in fact , us and british troops may have only themselves to blame .
increased sand drift was one of the effects noted during and after the first gulf war .
this is because the desert in the region normally has a crust , what arabs call " the desert skin , " consisting of sand and clay particles that have been baked together , or sintered , by the heat and sun .
sometimes this crust is strong enough to carry a person and sometimes not , much like the hard ice crust that develops on snow in colder climates .
under the crust , the sand particles are loose .
other women , such as his self-proclaimed mistress judith campbell , reportedly had sexual relationships with mafia figures as well .
the sense of entitlement that sustained such male fecklessness has been steadily eroded ever since – a process that , like so much in american culture , has played out on television .
popular series like “ the good wife ” show the pain and suffering of the political spouses who are expected to keep a stiff upper lip and a ladylike demeanor in the face of behavioral double standards .
similarly , the series “ mad men , ” with its dashing advertising executives who consume women like lunchtime cocktails , plumbs the emptiness and destructiveness of early-1960 ’s male sexual prerogative .
this reassessment of male sexual privilege and irresponsibility in the 1960 ’s has occurred in other arenas as well – reinforcing the transformation of kennedy ’s image from charming playboy to dangerously compulsive predator .
one major truth about the past year is that financial market problems lie not just with hedge funds - which are the biggest and least regulated gamblers - but with good old commercial banks , which display an uncanny ability to create trouble by excessively risky gambling , whether in loans to emerging markets or to the likes of ltcm .
the banks that lent huge sums , mostly unsecured , to ltcm , are the same ones that put in around $ 175 billion of short-term loans to five east asian developing countries ( indonesia , korea , malaysia , the philippines , thailand ) , and then abruptly reversed gear , and yanked out tens of billions of loans in 1997 and 1998 .
amazingly , chase manhattan reports that it had exposure of some $ 32 billion in loans and derivatives at ltcm , roughly 2 % of the bank 's total loan and credit exposure to just the one hedge fund !
ltcm also illustrates some truths about financial market crises , and how to manage them .
when push came to shove , with ltcm on the brink of collapse , the federal reserve did n't simply let " market forces " take their course .
cambridge – public-private cooperation or coordination is receiving considerable attention nowadays .
a plethora of centers for the study of business and government relations have been created , and researchers have produced a large literature on the design , analysis , and evaluation of public-private partnerships .
even the world economic forum has been transformed into “ an international organization for public-private cooperation . ”
of course , private-private coordination has been the essence of economics for the past 250 years .
while adam smith started us on the optimistic belief that an invisible hand would take care of most coordination issues , in the intervening period economists discovered all sorts of market failures , informational imperfections , and incentive problems , which have given rise to rules , regulations , and other forms of government and societal intervention .
the president ’s daughter , ivanka trump , is spearheading the effort .
while it is easy to be cynical ( some say the new program is just an excuse to cut funds from existing retraining programs ) , the idea that digital platforms can massively improve re-education and training is a good one .
but while the trump administration has strengthened the us economy ’s long-term growth potential in some ways , the other side of the ledger is rather grim .
for starters , a wide range of studies – from the work of the late economist david landes to more recent research by mit ’s daron acemoglu and the university of chicago ’s james a. robinson – find that institutions and political culture are the single most important determinants of long-term growth .
recovery from the damage trump is inflicting on institutions and political culture in the us may take years ; if so , the economic costs could be considerable .
most economists now believe that russia can not maintain annual gdp growth at a rate above 2 % without another sustained rise in oil prices .
but 2 % growth ( a respectable rate for an advanced economy ) would represent a major blow to russia ’s standing and putin ’s personal prestige , and could endanger domestic stability if jobs are lost in critical manufacturing sectors .
putin is perplexed about how to counter the threat posed by slow growth .
his main proposal so far has been a “ eurasian union ” – an expanded version of the current customs union among russia , belarus , and kazakhstan .
this would provide a platform to re-establish trade , transport , and other links among former soviet countries and thus capture regional markets for russian products , guarantee russian jobs , and re-assert russian political influence in its old neighborhood .
the ecb , quite sensibly , wants all of the potential horrors to be visible before the takeover – so that it can not be blamed .
with national supervisors , who are often inclined to present a rosy picture of their countries ’ institutions , no longer in charge , we can hope that the assessment will be more robust than the earlier stress tests carried out under the auspices of the european banking authority ( eba ) .
those tests , unlike their equivalent in the united states , failed to rebuild confidence .
several banks that passed with flying colors were soon obliged to raise new capital .
but the creation of the european banking union has not been the only important change to europe ’s financial regulation since the crisis .
not all succeeded ; but the successes ( germany , for example ) far outweigh the failures ( see greece ) .
the key to ensuring the future of europe ’s social-security systems , and thus its social model , is faster growth .
and , again , it is difficult to see how more europe would improve the situation .
the obstacles to growth are well known , and have existed for a long time without being removed .
the reason is quite simple : if there were a politically easy way to generate growth , it would have been implemented already .
many state-owned firms were privatized for ten times the sums yielded in asset sales under the previous government of edvard shevardnadze .
but an utter lack of transparency allowed russian companies , and their subsidiaries registered in third countries , to snap up most of the new offerings .
typical was the russian holding company promyslennye investory ( industrial investors ) , which managed to get a major gold mine and then half of a plant producing gold alloys .
russia ’s main foreign policy instrument in georgia is gazprom , the state-controlled gas monopoly .
gazprom ’s aim is to control not only the gas industry in georgia , but also the only pipeline that feeds russian gas to both georgia and armenia .
as always , the main victims are civilians caught in the crossfire .
the renewed fighting , coming eight months after a promising peace initiative known as the “ goma agreement , ” means more civilian deaths and little chance of normality returning to the eastern part of congo .
yet , even at times when fighting is less intense congo suffers from the indirect effects of the war .
a mortality survey conducted by the international rescue committee ( irc ) and released earlier this year demonstrates that this conflict is the world ’s most deadly crisis since world war ii : an estimated 5.4 million people have died as a consequence of the war and its lingering effects in the last decade .
today , a quarter of a million people are on the run , almost half of them on territory under rebel control and with almost no access to aid .
henry kissinger once said , “ peace can be achieved only by hegemony or by balance of power . ”
the same could perhaps be said of trade , or even of globalization itself .
it is no accident that the two great eras of globalization – the decades leading up to world war i and the last 75 years – were characterized by balance of power and hegemony , respectively .
of course , trade requires more than the absence of conflict .
like all economic activity , it flourishes when property rights are respected , taxation is efficient and purposeful , letters of credit are honored , tariffs and other barriers are removed , and so forth .
for smes , externships provide much-needed creative manpower .
for larger companies , they are avenues for corporate citizenship and innovation .
when properly integrated into a student ’s education , externships can provide the competitive edge on college application essays and at campus or alumni interviews , which admissions committees increasingly use to distinguish twenty-first century leaders from the competing hordes of top-scoring test-takers .
externships offer transparency and accountability for educators and imbue a spirit of fearlessness in students .
our education system can no longer afford to wall itself off from the world of industry .
but several million americans – black , white , and hispanic – now live in households with per capita income of less than $ 2 a day , essentially the same standard that the world bank uses to define destitution-level poverty in india or africa .
finding shelter in the united states on that income is so difficult that $ 2-a-day poverty is almost certainly much worse in the us than $ 2-a-day poverty in india or africa .
beyond that , america ’s much-vaunted equality of opportunity is under threat .
towns and cities that have lost their factories to globalization have also lost their tax base and find it hard to maintain quality schools – the escape route for the next generation .
elite schools recruit the wealthy to pay their bills , and court minorities to redress centuries of discrimination ; but this no doubt fosters resentment among the white working class , whose kids find no place in this brave new world .
once a company identifies which users have the most influence – well-known bloggers , for example – it may offer them better treatment , in the hope that they will recommend the service .
website startups may even want to check their users ’ profiles on the angel list database of angel investors , viewing them as a potential source of financing .
others might use services such as intercom to gain insight into their users ’ interests – from their preferences in music to their favorite hobbies – in order to offer more personalized service .
indeed , many online services now offer to link users with their facebook friends or linkedin contacts , or recommend activities or restaurants based on past behavior or current location .
some people do not want this kind of attention , whether because they are already well-known personalities trying to fend off adoring fans or mooches , or simply because they are uncomfortable with unknown entities knowing so much about them .
french catholics now feel as though their historically privileged position is under attack – by the rise of islam and islamist-inspired terrorist attacks , and by legislation that has increasingly challenged their way of life .
for many conservative catholics , same-sex marriage was a tipping point , while left-wing catholics find themselves being crowded out by the right .
french politics has no analogue to america ’s alt-right milieu – with its conspiracy theories , talk shows , online trolling , and fake news – that fueled trump ’s campaign .
but fillon ’s supporters , too , reject multiculturalism and have responded to their status anxiety by dismissing expertise .
with france becoming less catholic and the us becoming more diverse , their “ zombie ” armies ’ political power will decay ; but , as trump ’s election and fillon ’s political ascendance have shown , they can not be written off just yet .
for better or worse , our central banks manage the quantity and flow of money by withdrawing or adding paper assets to the stock held by private banks .
when they want to stimulate economic activity , central banks buy from private banks commercial loans , mortgages , deposits , and other assets .
the banks then have more cash to lend .
and vice versa when the authorities want to cool down the economy .
but the more successful libra becomes , the more money people will transfer from their bank account to their libra wallet and the less able central banks will be to stabilize the economy .
with the american invasion of iraq in 2003 , french-american relations reached a low point .
the bush administration felt betrayed by french diplomatic tactics at the united nations , while french president jacques chirac felt confirmed in his mistrust of the sole superpower and his call for a multipolar world .
today , on the eve of the french presidential elections , opinion polls show that three-quarters of french voters believe that france should distance itself from the united states .
despite a long history of alliance dating back to the american revolution and including two world wars , france has always had a somewhat ambivalent attitude toward the us , and the iraq war was not the first time that a controversial security policy undercut america ’s attractiveness in france .
polls show similar reactions after the suez crisis of 1956 , the vietnam war in the late 1960 ’s and early 1970 ’s , and the deployment of intermediate range missiles in europe in the early 1980 ’s .
they can do so in a variety of ways , such as by investing in education , funding scientific and technological research , and building efficient infrastructure .
tax competition is not the way to go , not least because it reduces the revenues needed to make such investments , particularly in developing countries , which , according to a 2015 international monetary fund report , lose out on more than $ 200 billion per year because of tax avoidance by multinationals .
when countries create tax regimes that are effectively designed to steal tax revenues from others , the result is also less money for education , health care , poverty-reduction programs , and measures to address climate change .
this should not be allowed , and multinationals should stop adding to the problem by threatening to leave countries unless taxes are cut .
after all , a basic principle of corporate social responsibility is that firms should pay their fair share of taxes wherever they operate .
what ’s more , the rapid expansion of etfs coincided with bull markets .
index performance largely dictated security selection , and asset allocation meant little more than piling into stocks , bonds , and credit .
but those days are probably over .
further sustained market advances are unlikely , given stretched stock and bond valuations , slowing economic and earnings growth , and heightened political and policy uncertainty .
broad market returns are likely to be lower , with episodes of volatility probably more frequent .
cambridge – economics teaches that the measure of an individual ’s wellbeing is the quantity and variety of goods he or she can consume .
consumption possibilities are in turn maximized by providing firms with the freedom they need to take advantage of new technologies , the division of labor , economies of scale , and mobility .
consumption is the goal ; production is the means to it .
markets , rather than communities , are the unit and object of analysis .
no one can deny that this consumer - and market-centric vision of the economy has produced plenty of fruit .
fragmentation – meaning the end of the internet – is a real threat .
some estimates put the internet ’s economic contribution to global gdp as high as $ 4.2 trillion in 2016 .
a fragmented “ splinternet ” would be very costly to the world , but that is one of the possible futures outlined last month in the report of the global commission on internet governance , chaired by former swedish prime minister carl bildt .
the internet now connects nearly half the world ’s population , and another billion people – as well as some 20 billion devices – are forecast to be connected in the next five years .
but further expansion is not guaranteed .
that sounded like a pleasant experience – maybe a learning experience – for young men who would otherwise be idle and unemployed .
but it was not a great inspiration for the future , which may help to explain why roosevelt ’s new deal was unable to end america ’s economic malaise .
by contrast , the apparent relative strength of the us economy today may reflect some highly visible recent inspirations .
the fracking revolution , widely viewed as originating in the us , has helped to lower energy prices and has eliminated america ’s dependency on foreign oil .
likewise , much of the rapid advance in communications in recent years reflects innovations – smartphone and tablet hardware and software , for example – that has been indigenous to the us .
and roughly 445 million people will need improved access to safe water supplies – part of reducing the unpaid care work carried out by women in developing countries .
this ambitious agenda will not be delivered effectively without action from governments working in concert with the private sector and nongovernmental organizations .
it will require additional investment , the creation of job opportunities for women , and the introduction of measures to help women move into more productive work .
mgi identified several interventions around the world that could easily be deployed more broadly .
measures proven to improve access to education include building more secondary schools , ensuring that girls are provided with sanitation facilities in the places where they study , and creating financial incentives – including cash transfers – to raise enrollment and keep girls in school .
the unhcr , as currently conceived is not the independent , nonpartisan agency it claims to be .
heavily dependent on donors and host governments to launch relief operations , it is beholden to their interests and does not always have the political support it needs to get the job done .
the other major multilateral migration agency , the iom , assists in the return of migrants , asylum seekers , refugees , and the internally displaced to their place of origin , or to other countries or regions that have agreed to accept them .
but , like the unhcr , governance issues plague the iom .
in particular , the iom lacks a mechanism to evaluate whether national governments are using coercion – banned under international law – to repatriate or relocate refugees .
with political gridlock blocking an appropriate fiscal response – after 2008 , the united states congress did not pass an annual budget , a basic component of responsible economic governance , for five years – central banks have been forced to bolster economies artificially .
to do so , they have relied on near-zero interest rates and unconventional measures like quantitative easing to stimulate growth and job creation .
beyond being incomplete , this approach implicitly favors the wealthy , who hold a disproportionately large share of financial assets .
meanwhile , companies have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to reduce their tax bills , including through so-called inversions , by which they move their headquarters to lower-tax jurisdictions .
as a result , most countries face a trio of inequalities – of income , wealth , and opportunity – which , left unchecked , reinforce one another , with far-reaching consequences .
and even the administration ’s plan to favor skilled over unskilled workers will not necessarily reduce the number of legal migrants in the country .
all told , trump has governed like a plutocrat in populist clothes – that is , a pluto-populist .
but why has his base let him get away with pursuing policies that mostly hurt them ?
according to one view , he is betting that social conservatives and white blue-collar supporters in rural areas will vote on the basis of nationalist and religious sentiment and antipathy toward secular coastal elites , rather than for their own financial interests .
but how long can anyone be expected to support “ god and guns ” at the expense of “ bread and butter ” ?
the holiday received its current name in 2006 , and , according to a recent survey by the russian pollster fom , 59 % of russians consider it to be special or significant ( 32 % do not ) .
unfortunately , february 23 is not the only remaining relic of the red army .
another soviet military legacy is the system of obligatory conscription .
while all other large european countries abolished military conscription in recent decades , russia continues with a system in which all physically-fit male citizens aged 18 to 27 must serve for 12 months .
exemptions are based on medical conditions , and are given to university students and employees of certain organizations ( for example , the police ) .
paris – tunisia , one of the arab league ’s 22 members , is in the throes of a severe and profound crisis , albeit possibly one with a favorable resolution .
it is the smallest north african country , covering 163,000 square kilometers – more or less twice the size of belgium , netherlands , and luxembourg – and containing a population of 10.5 million .
it is also full of charm and moderation in terms of its climate , history , and culture .
it once was the pillar of the cultural dynamism and influence of the roman republic and empire .
the first african region to be christianized , it was the land of saint augustine and the main source for catholic evangelism in africa .
true , any arab – indeed , virtually everyone – knows exactly who is responsible for khashoggi ’s disappearance : crown prince mohammed bin salman of saudi arabia .
but the fact that a well-known cartoonist had to disguise the culprit ’s image speaks volumes about the fear felt by independent journalists in the arab world .
khashoggi ’s disappearance has only deepened their anxiety .
arab countries have a long history of rewarding journalists who toe the official line , while punishing those , like khashoggi , who dare to speak truth to power .
since the failed arab spring revolutions – of which tunisia is the only success story – citizens across the region have found themselves with a stark choice between radical islamist regimes and military rule .
it will be hard to reverse financial liberalization , but its negative side effects – including greater systemic risk – require a series of reforms .
first , more information and transparency about complex assets and who is holding them are needed .
second , complex instruments should be traded on exchanges rather than on over-the-counter markets , and they should be standardized so that liquid secondary markets for them can arise .
third , we need better supervision and regulation of the financial system , including regulation of opaque or highly leveraged financial institutions such as hedge funds and even sovereign wealth funds .
fourth , the role of rating agencies needs to be rethought , with more regulation and competition introduced .
and yet it is just one of the many domestic challenges facing the region .
arabs must take charge of their own agenda , and become the primary force defining their future and that of their countries .
they should , of course , continue to engage with the outside world and strengthen their strategic relationships and alliances .
but they also must become less dependent on others .
for starters , the region ’s governments need to develop their own national-security capacities , to defend against non-existential threats and hegemonic expansionism .
now , a new paper by servaas storm effectively demolishes another famous trope of neoliberal economics : the argument that labor market “ rigidities ” depress output and employment .
one of the empirical investigations most often cited for this argument is a paper by timothy besley and robin burgess using manufacturing data across indian states for the period 1958-92 .
besley and burgess claimed to show that pro-worker regulations in some states resulted in lower output , employment , investment , and productivity , and even increased urban poverty , relative to states that did not adopt such regulations .
this conclusion came to underpin the conventional wisdom that labor-market regulation is harmful for industrial expansion , and that the way to increase production and employment in manufacturing is to promote more labor-market “ flexibility ” by repealing laws that protect workers .
this wisdom prevailed not only in india ; it influenced policies accordingly across a wide range of developing countries .
britain ’s economic prospects increasingly depend on events beyond its shores , whether just across the english channel or in china or california .
environmental hazards blow in on the wind .
swelling migration pressures threaten to overwhelm any pretense at border controls .
security concerns increasingly implicate foreign and domestic policies simultaneously .
a recent political cartoon showed british bombers taking off on a mission , with one pilot saying to the others , “ it seems a long way to go to bomb a few young men from south london . ”
after that election , perhaps heady with the magnitude of his support , he proposed deepening his revolution with new laws on the organization of society and the economy .
these laws , already approved but not fully implemented , should be the catalyst for a new institutional arrangement within the country , one supposedly premised on a direct relationship between leader and people and a progressive hollowing out of democratic institutions .
meanwhile , all bodies of public power – all of them – now obey chávez .
given this history , it is noteworthy that , in his speech the day after his victory , chávez called for coexistence , dialogue , debate , and for everyone to work together for the good of venezuela .
he emphasized that the people had voted for chávez and socialism .
genes can be damaged by environmental factors , such as radiation or chemicals .
they can also be damaged by the products of normal metabolism .
our bodies have elaborate repair systems that maintain the integrity of our genes , even in the presence of damaging agents .
occasionally , however , damage is not repaired .
if the damage occurs in key genes that regulate cell growth , cancer can develop .
ithaca – the internet was once hailed as a powerful democratizing force – enabling innovative start-ups to compete with established businesses , disrupt entire industries , and create new ones .
but as some of those startups grew into behemoths , they turned this force on its head .
far from leveling the playing field , big tech now largely owns it , and rather than democratizing the economy , the internet has ended up exacerbating the world ’s inequality problem .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
“ but the developing world can make it much worse . ”
in announcing a new sino-us joint research effort , chu described clean energy as “ one of the great opportunities of our time ” for sino-us cooperation , saying that by “ working together , we can accomplish more than [ by ] acting alone . ”
still , one is left wonder if this new collaborative bonhomie and ethnic bonding will prove strong enough to cut through not only the long history of distrustful interactions between the us and china , but also the destabilizing effects of china ’s sudden economic rise ?
for , although the us has drawn strength from the ideal of a “ melting pot ” – and president barack obama ’s cabinet does represent a new high-water mark for diversity – americans have often shown a xenophobic distrust of immigrants who have drawn too close to power .
especially in the case of chinese , fears of divided national loyalties and “ fifth columns ” have been strong .
greece ’s economic weakness increases the current level of the deficit .
five years of declining gdp have depressed tax receipts and increased transfer payments .
the imf estimates that these cyclical effects on revenue and outlays have raised the overall deficit by nearly 5 % of greek gdp .
on a cyclically adjusted basis , greece ’s overall budget would show a surplus of 0.6 % of gdp this year .
this also implies that if greece could escape from its current recession , its national debt would decline , both absolutely and as a share of gdp .
as indian prime minister manmohan singh put it during wen ’s visit , “ india and china can together reshape the world order . ”
the two countries ’ recent rapprochement marks a huge change from the hostility that bedeviled their relations following their 1962 war over a disputed border in the himalayas .
when i first visited india as an american government official in the late 1970 ’s , i was struck by my indian hosts ’ fixation on gaining equal status with china .
in 1998 , when india tested its nuclear weapons , the defense minister referred to china , and then prime minister atal bihari vajpayee spoke of china as india ’s number one enemy .
by contrast , on more recent visits to india , i have found my hosts referring to the need to learn from china .
since hildebrand was independently wealthy , this approach would not have easily worked with him .
so did he receive the stick instead of the carrot ?
fortunately , we have a good independent test .
the head of the european banking authority , andrea enria , has issued new regulations that are not bank-friendly .
while one can debate the appropriateness of tightening accounting standards in the middle of a crisis , his order that banks increase their capital is entirely justified , especially at a time when the european central bank is subsidizing them with a wall of three-year liquidity at almost zero cost .
second , and partly as a consequence , virtually all eurozone countries ’ debt is trading at a discount relative to german bunds .
while it was necessary to price risk more accurately , it is difficult to believe that the netherlands , with a debt ratio nearly 20 percentage points lower than germany ’s , deserves to be assessed as a higher default risk .
but now even the mighty bund has started to suffer from heightened market anxiety .
third , financial-market participants and , increasingly , real businesses are pricing in a possible breakup of the eurozone , if not the end of the euro itself .
it is still difficult to think the unthinkable , let alone work out the details of it , but any rational player must now consider the possibility .
indeed , by coincidence , on the sunday the young football fan was murdered in moscow , vladislav surkov , the first deputy in president dmitri medvedev ’s administration , was meeting michael mcfaul of president barack obama ’s national security council .
that meeting was taking place as part of a gathering , led by surkov , of russian youth-movement activists .
one quote from surkov that day is particularly telling : “ make ready for the elections , train your brains and muscles .
you can always rely on our support . ”
those muscles were put to use outside the kremlin walls that very day .
hong kong – sesame street ’s kermit the frog once lamented that “ it ’s not easy bein ’ green . ”
today , this sentiment is surprisingly relevant to the global economy – only it is becoming green that is the problem .
last september , the intergovernmental panel for climate change warned that if the world sticks with “ business as usual , ” global temperatures may rise more than 4 ° c – far beyond the 2 ° c increase that has been deemed “ safe . ”
this prompted un secretary-general ban ki-moon to challenge political , economic , and financial leaders in january to intensify their efforts to achieve a new global agreement on climate change by 2015 .
but , as important as high-level deals are , they will amount to little unless they are backed by considerable investment in areas like smart grids , energy storage , and renewables .
the search for a new managing director of the imf provides a keen reminder of how unjust today 's international institutions are .
created in the postwar world of 1945 , they reflect realities that have long ceased to exist .
the organization and allocation of power in the un , the imf , the world bank , and the g7 meetings reflects a global equilibrium that disappeared long ago .
after wwii germany and japan were the defeated aggressors , the soviet union posed a major threat , and china was engulfed in a civil war that would bring mao 's communists to power .
much of the so-called third world was either recently independent , or remained colonies ; all of it was very poor .
just before the brexit referendum in 2016 , then-british prime minister david cameron made a last-minute appeal to german chancellor angela merkel , imploring her to agree to a cap on the movement of people into the uk .
merkel refused , and the brexit referendum passed by a narrow margin .
the irony is that merkel is now facing the same anti-immigration backlash that cameron did in 2016 .
immigration tends to be good for an economy over the long term , especially if the ratio of retirees to workers is rising .
but when the level of immigration exceeds a country ’s capacity to absorb new workers , there can be severe economic and social costs , at least in the short term .
the odious debt idea was revived in an influential 2006 article by seema jayachandran and michael kremer , and in a 2010 report by the center for global development ( cgd ) , which proposed that economic sanctions include a mechanism aimed at preventing the accumulation of odious obligations .
the mechanism would take the form of a declaration that debt issued by a particular government would be considered odious .
in effect , this is what the trump administration has just done .
such a declaration reduces the flow of funds to odious regimes , owing to the risk that successor governments will renounce their predecessor ’s debts without incurring legal and reputational costs ( because participating countries ’ courts will not enforce the debt contracts ) .
the cgd report proposes that a regime should be considered odious if it abuses the human rights of the population , employs military coercion , perpetrates electoral fraud , and mismanages or misappropriates public funds .
that cleared the way for the return of bhutto , who remained prime minister until 1996 , when she was dismissed yet again – this time , by her own pakistan peoples party .
in 1997 , it was sharif ’s turn again .
but his confrontation with the military had intensified over the years , resulting in another coup in 1999 , leading to eight years of military rule under general pervez musharraf .
in 2008 , musharraf resigned under popular pressure , and a new election brought asif zardari , the widower of benazir bhutto , who had been assassinated the previous december , to the presidency .
ignoring constitutional requirements , zardari did not transfer executive authority to his prime minister , and instead expected the two prime ministers who served under him to follow his orders .
rich countries ' transition from subsistence economies to sustained growth and prosperity was conditioned on a profound demographic shift -- occurring in the 19 th century in western europe and throughout the 20 th century in east asia -- in which fertility rates fell dramatically .
the last two decades have witnessed similarly sharp fertility declines in poor countries that are now showing solid signs of economic progress .
in egypt , for example , fertility rates declined from 4.8 to 2.9 children per woman in the last 15 years .
during the last decade , egypt 's average annual per capita income grew by 2.6 % .
during the same period , tunisia 's rate of population growth fell by more than 50 % , to a european level of slightly more than two children per woman , while per capita income grew at an impressive annual rate of 3 % .
in response to former us president barack obama ’s efforts to create a pacific-rim trade bloc to contain china , xi launched his belt and road initiative ( bri ) , which is now being met by an american-led indo-pacific initiative under trump .
the two countries are also on similar paths militarily .
though china still has a lot of catching up to do , its total defense spending is already second only to the us .
it has built and launched its first aircraft carrier , and has plans to launch more .
it is developing and deploying anti-access/area-denial ( a2/ad ) defense systems .
america ’s misadventure in iraq , its exhaustion as a world power , and its unwillingness to maintain its previous level of commitment to the region have rendered the sykes-picot structure untenable , because no other external force for order is available .
the resulting vacuum has been filled by various currents of political islam , terrorism , protest movements , uprisings , secession attempts by national or religious minorities , and aspiring regional hegemons ( iran and saudi arabia ) .
indeed , the partial withdrawal of the us implies that the end of the enforced stability of the old middle east will not spare the sykes-picot borders .
developments in syria and iraq already suggest as much , and the future of lebanon and jordan has become increasingly uncertain .
one of the few positive features of the region is that no global power rivalries are currently playing out there .
why are services so important for china ’s rebalancing ?
for starters , services are far more labor-intensive than the country ’s traditional growth sectors .
in 2011 , chinese services generated 30 % more jobs per unit of output than did manufacturing and construction .
this means that the chinese economy can achieve its all-important labor-absorption objectives – employment , urbanization , and poverty reduction – with much slower gdp growth than in the past .
in other words , a 7-8 % growth trajectory in an increasingly services-led economy can hit the same labor-absorption targets that required 10 % growth under china ’s previous model .
the united kingdom now seems certain to hold , by 2016 , a referendum on remaining in the eu , and a far-left party – determined , as in greece , to escape the rigors of economic reform – could win spain ’s general election next autumn .
certainly , events could turn out positively , with the uk remaining part of the eu , and spain opting for the status quo or a more moderate vision of change than greece ’s syriza-led government has embraced .
but the worst-case scenario for the eu ’s future looks increasingly likely : “ grexit ” ( greece leaving the eurozone ) , “ brexit ” ( the uk leaving the eu ) , and a spanish election result that resembles greece ’s .
should such a perfect storm occur , the eu ’s very existence would be in doubt , because other member countries would consider or begin planning their own post-eu futures .
indeed , all of the euroskeptic and nationalist forces in the eu ’s member states would strive , with increasing success , to make their respective countries ’ withdrawal from the eu the central issue in domestic political debate and election campaigns .
oil prices are at historic highs .
the leading economies are entering a recession .
climate change negotiations are going around in circles .
aid to the poorest countries is stagnant , despite years of promised increases .
and yet in this gathering storm it was hard to find a single real accomplishment by the world ’s leaders .
two years earlier , in 2015 , mauricio macri won the presidency on his promise that fiscal adjustment and opening argentina to the world would spur economic revival .
instead , they paved the way for his defeat .
in a few short years , the package of pro-market reforms and economic opening seemed out of step with the rest of the world .
deglobalization , nativism , and protectionism set a new tone for politics , with frustration and uncertainty about the future overshadowing hope .
frustration is even afflicting the region ’s paragon of open-market politics , chile .
ronald reagan asserted in 1980 that it was “ morning in america , ” but in america now , it is the morning after .
this drive toward an off-the-grid , eat-what-you-raise , bike-there-on-your-own , solar-powered collective fantasy is inevitable : americans were pumped full of hope that more consumption would make them happier , and instead were left with a pile of debt .
they were asked to admire the top of the income pyramid , only to find that they were looking at a pyramid scheme .
it is no wonder therefore , that a kind of survivalist chic has become the updated version of the radical , communal chic of the 1960 ’s .
americans have lost their faith in those who , in the boom times , purred , “ trust us . ”
to be sure , china is careful to avoid any dramatic action that could become a casus belli by itself .
indeed , it has repeatedly shown a knack for disaggregating its strategy into multiple parts and then pursuing each element separately in such a manner as to allow the different pieces to fall into place with minimal resistance .
this shrewdness not only keeps opponents off balance ; it also undercuts the relevance of us security assurances to allies and the value of building countervailing strategic partnerships in asia .
in fact , by camouflaging offense as defense , china casts the burden of starting a war on an opponent , while it seeks to lay the foundation – brick by brick – of a hegemonic middle kingdom .
chinese leaders ’ stated desire to resolve territorial disputes peacefully simply means achieving a position strong enough to get their way without having to fire a shot .
these cities are learning from one another , building on good ideas and jettisoning poorer ones .
los angeles took decades to implement pollution controls , but other cities , like beijing , converted rapidly when they saw the benefits .
in the coming decades , we may see a global system of interconnected sustainable cities emerging .
if successful , everyone will want to join the club .
fundamentally , this is the right approach for managing systemic risk and change in complex interconnected systems , and for successfully managing common resources – though it has yet to dent the inexorable rise in global greenhouse-gas emissions .
new york – a few years ago , as part of a western delegation to china , i met president xi jinping in beijing ’s great hall of the people .
when addressing us , xi argued that china ’s rise would be peaceful , and that other countries – namely , the united states – need not worry about the “ thucydides trap , ” so named for the greek historian who chronicled how sparta ’s fear of a rising athens made war between the two inevitable .
in his 2017 book destined for war : can america and china escape thucydides ’s trap ? , harvard university ’s graham allison examines 16 earlier rivalries between an emerging and an established power , and finds that 12 of them led to war .
no doubt , xi wanted us to focus on the remaining four .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
what is a reasonable view of china 's recent history ?
to put it crudely : does it matter that the chinese communist party killed millions upon millions people , desecrated the environment and deeply wounded china 's traditional culture ?
chinese intellectuals tend to avoid the issue , shrugging it off as irrelevant and anyway too unpleasant to contemplate .
we need to look ahead and not back , they say .
things are finally moving in the right direction and let 's not , please , do anything that may upset that hopeful movement .
london – what do the recently released panama papers , exxonmobil , and a canadian mining company operating in guatemala have in common ?
they are all cases in which powerful individuals and organizations tried to obfuscate , deceive , or hide behind a front .
and they are all cases in which that effort did n’t work .
the global uproar triggered by the panama papers – 11.5 million files taken , apparently by computer hackers , from the world ’s fourth-largest offshore law firm , panama ’s mossack fonseca – is likely to continue for some time .
the files ’ release has revealed the extreme , and sometimes costly , lengths that individuals go to hide their assets and avoid taxation .
the longer-term consequences will not be savory , but they will be problems for another day .
some will say that the fatal mistake was allowing greece to adopt the euro in the first place .
that the country was unprepared should have been clear .
its fiscal policies were already out of control when it joined the monetary union in 2001 , and its trade unions were agitating to push wages up to european levels , despite lagging productivity .
but this answer is too simple , given that such signs of dysfunction are not limited to greece .
that policy was destined to produce a financial crisis , because it was bound to leave governments and banks with depleted assets and larger debts .
despite austerity , the forecast of this year ’s uk structural deficit has increased from 6.5 % to 8 % – requiring an extra £ 22 billion ( $ 34.6 billion ) in cuts a year .
prime minister david cameron and chancellor george osborne blame the eurozone crisis ; in fact , their own economic illiteracy is to blame .
unfortunately for all of us , the explanation bears repeating nowadays .
depressions , recessions , contractions – call them what you will – occur because the private-sector spends less than it did previously .
paris – last month , the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere surpassed 400 parts per million for the first time in roughly three million years .
if the current trend , which fits the worst-case scenario laid out by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) , persists , co2 concentrations will rise above 800 ppm toward the end of this century – with devastating consequences .
indeed , the predicted global average temperature increase of 2.4-6.4 ° c caused by such high ambient co2 concentrations is expected to trigger the worst outcomes foreseen in the ipcc scenarios , including the loss of an estimated 40 % of species , more frequent extreme weather events , and widespread water scarcity .
in order to avoid imposing such risk and uncertainty on future generations , global carbon emissions , which stand at 8.5 gigatons annually , must be halved by 2050 .
even in the ipcc ’s best-case scenario , co2 concentrations will increase to 550 ppm by the end of the century – a level that many researchers argue would already be too high to avoid dire consequences .
the us has turned a corner in rebuilding its fisheries and ensuring that they are sustainable .
the european commission has just presented a proposal to reform the common fisheries policy designed to help rebuild europe ’s fisheries .
good science is the cornerstone of both policies .
but it is not enough to get our respective houses in order .
because fish and other ocean wildlife do not stay within national boundaries , international cooperation is essential to the long-term health of the world ’s oceans and the sustainability of fisheries and fishing jobs .
technologies that engage patients in their own health care and enable more seamless adherence to medication regimes have the potential to improve disease management , reduce hospitalization , and lower costs .
today ’s transformational advances in health care owe much to new genomics information , to the availability of big data to influence decisions in real time , to more targeted and individualized therapies , and to smarter , more connected delivery systems .
but they are just the beginning .
further breakthroughs , enabled by the convergence of science and technology , can be expected , especially as unconventional players enter the health-care sector .
in this process , partnerships between health-care and technology companies will become increasingly important .
when the incentives for money to flow across borders are strong , it will find a way , abetted by the proliferation of firms with operations in multiple countries and the expansion of international trade – which serves as a conduit for masking capital flows and evading controls .
even in a tightly managed economy like china , massive capital inflows have been able to find their way around controls over the last decade .
moreover , establishing controls on one type of inflow simply leads to its being disguised in other forms .
capital controls have real costs , even if they fail to stanch inflows .
they create a layer of protection from competition for those who are better connected , politically or economically , or have the sheer heft to get around the restrictions .
such shifts may emerge only slowly , but they can fundamentally change the calculus for pricing in risks and potential returns .
today ’s market is easy to explain in terms of fundamental factors : earnings are growing , inflation has been kept at bay , and the global economy appears to be experiencing a broad , synchronized expansion .
in october , the international monetary fund updated its global outlook to predict that only a handful of small countries will suffer a recession next year .
and while the major central banks are planning , or have already begun , to tighten monetary policy , interest rates will remain low for now .
political crises , however sensational they may be , are not likely to change investors ’ economic calculus .
skidelsky approvingly quoted krugman ’s claim that britain was “ doing worse this time than it did during the great depression . ”
more than once he echoed krugman ’s assertion that osborne had been motivated by an erroneous belief that if he did not reduce the deficit , he might forfeit investor confidence ( the “ confidence fairy ” ) .
just a week before the uk voted this month , skidelsky speculated that voters , “ still wobbly from osborne ’s medicine , ” might “ decide that they should have stayed in bed . ”
instead , the tories won an outright majority , confounding pollsters and keynesians alike .
what could possibly have gone wrong – or , rather , right ?
to my right sat dagan , who had just completed eight years as head of mossad ; to my left sat dore gold , a former academic and former israeli ambassador .
the two men held very different views about how best to guarantee israel ’s security , and it is worth recapitulating their respective arguments .
gold argued that returning to pre-1967 armistice lines would leave israel without “ defensible borders . ”
he insisted that israel could guard against threats from the east only if it maintained a military presence in the west bank and controlled the jordan river – which runs along the border separating jordan from israel and the west bank .
dagan countered that the military ’s role is to safeguard israel ’s borders , regardless of where those borders are drawn .
if a rip van winkle economist were to wake up today after a decades-long sleep and see only those numbers , he or she would assume that one-fifth of americans were unemployed and standing in lines outside soup kitchens .
instead , the us jobless rate is at its lowest level since neil armstrong took his famous first step onto the moon ’s surface 50 years ago .
the idea that the us wins in a global slump might sound like the sardonic musing of some unreconstructed marxist in the dingy corner of a faculty lounge .
but such a view is not ideological .
rather , global interest rates are scraping the floor because gdp growth outside the us is so sluggish .
from 1990-2002 , new zealand ’s private forest plantations increased by more than 1.4 million acres .
although not planted for climate purposes , these trees soak up carbon dioxide .
new zealand successfully negotiated to include this specific emission offset in its overall figures , neatly balancing the actual increase .
for safety ’s sake , the country also bought lots of foreign offsets , including highly dodgy ones from russia and ukraine .
but growing forests also reduced new zealand ’s emissions in the comparison year of 1990 .
berlin – europe finally appears to have moved past its multi-year economic crisis , but it remains unsettled .
for every reason for optimism , there always seems to be a new cause for concern .
in june 2016 , a slim majority of british voters chose nostalgia for the nineteenth-century past over whatever promise the twenty-first century might have held .
so they decided to jump off a cliff in the name of “ sovereignty . ”
there is much evidence to suggest that a hard landing awaits the united kingdom .
new york – the basic outlines of barack obama ’s approach to foreign policy became clear in 2009 .
his administration believes that the united states should talk with other governments even if it disagrees profoundly with their character .
he prefers acting with other countries to going it alone .
and he has shifted the focus of us foreign policy from what countries do within their borders to how they act beyond them .
all of this differentiates obama from his immediate predecessor , george w. bush , whose administration branded selected countries as evil and mostly refused to deal with them ; often rejected cooperation with other governments , lest the us find itself constrained ; and sought to transform other countries , rather than to influence their actions .
until now , the wealth of nations has been based upon the combustion of coal , gas , and oil .
but , if the 2 ° c target is taken seriously , the twenty-first century will see countries that are not so far down the path of carbonization ( such as large parts of africa ) , or that leave it in time ( such as india and pakistan ) , able to become wealthy by helping societies that must de-carbonize rapidly .
for the moment , all this is still utopian .
in its current state , cap-and-trade schemes to reduce emissions are far from being fair and effective ; a major improvement would include establishing a central climate bank to register and supervise the transfer of emissions credits .
this bank would also ensure that emissions trading did not run counter to the goal of remaining within the entire global budget , for example via the complete sale of unused emissions credits by individual developing countries at the beginning of the contract period .
in many countries , politicians and the media have been portraying refugees as a threat to security , cultural cohesion , and public resources .
former us secretary of state hillary clinton blamed her loss to donald trump in the 2016 presidential election , and the brexit vote that preceded it , on the public backlash against immigration , and recently suggested that europe should admit fewer refugees , in order to stem the rise of populism .
gunter nooke , germany ’s africa commissioner , had an even more unpalatable proposal : african countries should cede land to be administered by the european union as special economic zones , in what would amount to “ voluntary colonialism . ”
such solutions are not only unethical ; they would not end the crisis .
humanitarian aid alone will not work , either , except as a stopgap measure .
since 1988 , iran has had a government-funded , regulated system for purchasing kidneys .
a charitable association of patients arranges the transaction , for a set price , and no one except the seller profits from it .
according to a study published in 2006 by iranian kidney specialists , the scheme has eliminated the waiting list for kidneys in that country , without giving rise to ethical problems .
a 2006 bbc television program showed many potential donors turned away because they did not meet strict age criteria , and others who were required to visit a psychologist .
a more systematic study of the iranian system is still needed .
the concern then was discrimination : european countries , it was feared , would find it easier to import from one another , but , lacking dollars , would still refuse to import from america .
in addition , us officials worried that the epu would duplicate and undermine the functions of the newly created international monetary fund .
at this point , however , the two narratives diverge .
with the advent of the cold war , president harry s. truman ’s administration and the us congress recognized the urgency of european reconstruction .
to this end , they authorized the epu ’s use of $ 350 million of marshall plan funds .
washington , dc – the brexit referendum in the united kingdom and the presidential race in the united states have shown , among other things , that public distrust of global integration is on the rise .
that distrust could derail new trade agreements currently in the works , and prevent future ones from being initiated .
the danger implied by this scenario should not be underestimated .
isolationism and protectionism , if taken too far , would break the trade-based economic engine that has delivered peace and prosperity to the world for decades .
as a former trade minister for costa rica , i know how difficult it is for countries – developed and developing alike – to craft trade policies that deliver benefits to all of their people .
the uribe-lula-calderón axis appears set on keeping him there .
chávez is the loser not only because he had provided the farc moral support ( he once described them as “ belligerents , ” not terrorists , and publicly called uribe an american stooge ) , but also because it is believed that he has been providing the farc covert military support .
that backing appeared to be part of chávez ’s “ bolivarian ” socialist revolution , which has used venezuela ’s petrodollars to bankroll left-wing governments in ecuador , bolivia , and cuba in the hope of building up a regional anti-american alliance .
there were serious grounds over the last three years to believe that latin america was going through one of its regular bouts of left-wing destabilization , given the rise of bolivian president evo morales , ecuador ’s president rafael correa , and their ringleader , chávez .
but the recent worldwide increase in commodity prices has meant that the traditional regional powerhouses of chile , brazil , and mexico have experienced economic booms of their own .
even if the us federal reserve continues to lower interest rates , lenders will not rush to make more bad mortgages .
with house prices declining , fewer americans will be willing and able to continue their profligacy .
the bush administration is hoping , somehow , to forestall a wave of foreclosures – thereby passing the economy ’s problems on to the next president , just as it is doing with the iraq quagmire .
its chances of succeeding are slim .
for america today , the real question is only whether there will be a short , sharp downturn , or a more prolonged , but shallower , slowdown .
but centralization carries its own costs .
given the risk inherent in betting on policy convergence , labor mobility – which enables highly valuable human capital , especially well-educated young people , to leave lagging regions for those that offer more and better employment opportunities – could prove to be a critical tool for adjustment .
as it stands , labor mobility is imperfect in the eu .
but , with language training and the implementation of something like the lisbon strategy for growth and jobs ( which aimed to create an innovative “ learning economy , ” underpinned by inclusive social and environmental policies ) , mobility could be enhanced .
but more fluid labor mobility is no panacea .
today , most russian elites feel themselves not only european but , i believe , too european .
fixated on europe , they forget that they live in moscow or irkutk , not paris or budapest .
culturally we are predominantly european , but 8 % of our population is moslem , and we inherited a lot from asia : co-citizens , cuisine , cultural traits , and a common history .
many new russians , working like machines 16 hours a day , seven days a week , look at their more relaxed western counterparts with the contempt often found in the tiger economies of asia .
" it 's not america , you have to work here " -- is a popular joke .
other surrounding countries , including india , thailand , and malaysia , are also feeling the effects of the rohingya ’s plight .
far from moving to stop this humanitarian crisis , suu kyi ’s government has exacerbated it .
while suu kyi does not control the military , which is leading the murderous crackdown , her government has blocked un agencies from delivering vital emergency supplies .
the un population fund ( unfpa ) , refugee agency ( unhcr ) , and children ’s fund ( unicef ) have all been forced to halt work in the affected areas .
this represents a tragic departure for suu kyi , who previously won international acclaim – and a nobel peace prize – for her role in the fight for democracy in myanmar .
although eu-turkey relations are currently not at their best , the dialogue between the two sides must continue in 2017 , not least because of their common interests , which are based not only on economic interdependence , but also on the refugee crisis and the collective fight against terrorism .
european politics next year , meanwhile , will be consumed by the brexit negotiations .
in march , the united kingdom will likely invoke article 50 of the treaty of lisbon , triggering the formal procedure for withdrawal from the eu .
the challenge will be to reach an agreement that guarantees the wellbeing of future eu-uk relations .
this will not be easy , and eu negotiators have already set a timeline of only 18 months .
just days after obama declared last october that malaysia was a model of “ diversity and tolerance , ” malaysian authorities denied non-muslims the right to use the word “ allah ” in the practice of their own faiths – a decision condemned throughout the muslim world for its negative portrayal of islam .
moreover , members of najib ’s government endorse hudud , a class of penalties within sharia law that could imply strict limitations on muslims ’ right to choose how they practice their faith .
according to the us state department ’s own human-rights reports , curbs on religious freedoms have included demolition of hindu temples , bombings of christian churches , and a ban on the practice of shia islam , to which some 15 % of the world ’s muslims adhere .
likewise , according to the pew research center , najib ’s government has “ very high ” restrictions on religious freedom .
international measures of press freedom and corruption reveal persistent deficits as well .
there are not many human activities whose impact can reasonably be predicted decades , centuries , or even millennia in advance .
the fallout from nuclear waste is one ; humans ’ contribution to global warming through greenhouse-gas emissions from burning fossil fuels , and its impact on rising sea levels , is another .
indeed , the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) report stated , in uncharacteristically strong terms , that the sea level is “ virtually certain ” to continue to rise in the coming centuries or millennia .
moreover , the greater our emissions , the higher the seas will rise .
but the recent revelations about antarctica are different .
addis ababa – africa bears the brunt of lives lost , economies ruined , and relationships fractured by terrorism .
it is the continent where al-qaeda launched its war against the united states in 1998 , by bombing the us embassies in nairobi , kenya , and dar es salaam , tanzania ; where boko haram kidnapped 276 nigerian schoolgirls in 2014 ; and where 147 students were killed in their sleep at kenya ’s garissa university in 2015 .
while these attacks did garner the world ’s attention , most people do not realize that , in the past five years alone , 33,000 people have died in terrorism-related violence in africa .
violent extremism and groups espousing it are threatening to reverse africa ’s development gains not only in the near term , but also for decades to come .
african countries are particularly vulnerable to violent ideologues , owing to the prevalence of weak institutions and ungoverned territory where extremist groups can germinate .
the first problem is china ’s economy , so dynamic on the surface , but so rickety underneath .
the analyst chi lo lucidly presents a picture of macro success alongside micro failure .
the huge stimulus of rmb4 trillion ( $ 586 billion ) in november 2008 , mostly poured into loss-making state-owned enterprises via directed bank lending , sustained china ’s growth in the face of global recession .
but the price was an increasingly serious misallocation of capital , resulting in growing portfolios of bad loans , while excessive chinese household savings have inflated real-estate bubbles .
moreover , chi argues that the crisis of 2008 shattered china ’s export-led growth model , owing to prolonged impairment of demand in the advanced countries .
moreover , the us insists that it is not containing china ( as it did the soviet union ) ; on the contrary , china ’s economic rise has been facilitated by access to us markets , as well as to global markets through american support for chinese accession to the world trade organization .
on human rights , the us argues that there are indeed fundamental differences between the two countries ’ political traditions and current systems .
but , in the american view , this is vastly different from an organized national strategy of undermining the chinese state and its institutions .
for these reasons , the bilateral strategic-trust deficit is growing .
xi , to his credit , has advanced what he describes as a concept for “ a new type of great power relationship , ” one that seeks to avoid what others have concluded is the near-inevitability of long-term conflict between a rising power ( china ) and the established power ( america ) .
and there is little evidence that the corporate-tax burden actually does fall on employees rather than on capital .
the nonpartisan us congressional budget office and the institute for taxation and economic policy , among others , have demonstrated clearly that over 80 % of the impact of corporate taxation falls on shareholders , not workers .
still , market liberals would argue that corporate taxes “ distort ” behavior and hamper wealth creation .
but this is simplistic , at best .
for starters , tax competition among jurisdictions is quite different from competition among firms in the market .
doctors are not gods , but they increasingly play god by refusing to use life-extending techniques for patients and families who want them and are even willing to pay for them .
in holland , there is no private medicine .
the only recourse for dissatisfied patients is to leave the country or go to the courts .
europe 's welfare states thus face a serious dilemma .
there is no doubt that holland spends a substantial amount of money on caring for old people .
unfortunately , it is far from clear that the chinese model of infrastructure development can be exported universally .
china ’s strong central government overwhelms opposition from people displaced by new roads , bridges , and dams , and for many years ran roughshod over environmental concerns and workers ’ rights .
the parallels to the old soviet union are striking .
some developing countries in asia work differently .
in democratic india , for example , it took eight years to rebuild mumbai ’s airport , because courts forced the government to respect the rights of squatters on its outskirts .
and even when there are revenues to be earned , as there could be from airports , businesses might be deterred by the need to rely on long-term pricing agreements .
it is also easy to fall into the trap of thinking of the tax cuts as a way to boost aggregate demand .
but congressional republicans may insist on paying for the cuts in personal income tax by limiting the deductions that individuals now use to lower their tax bills .
the tax plan put forward on behalf of the republicans by paul ryan , the speaker of the house of representatives , calls for eliminating all deductions other than those for charitable contributions and mortgage interest .
that change would raise revenue equal to about 1 % of gdp , enough to pay for very substantial reductions in individual tax rates .
nairobi – african countries are often criticized for failing to meet their environmental challenges .
observers often cite loss of habitat in the face of population growth , land degradation , and industrialization .
and then there is the most frequent charge of all : that an increase in poaching is endangering species such as elephants and rhinos .
in kenya , however , an innovative and extensive conservation project is underway .
begun in the aberdare mountains in central kenya , “ rhino ark , ” originally conceived to protect the highly endangered black rhino from the ravages of poachers , is supported by the very people who might have resisted it : the local communities in some of the country ’s most productive farming areas .
the convoluted logic behind this strategy is quite disturbing – not only for the us , but also for the global economy .
there is nothing cyclical about the lasting aftershocks of a balance-sheet recession that have now been evident for nearly five years .
indeed , balance-sheet repair has barely begun for us households .
the personal-saving rate stood at just 3.7 % in august 2012 – up from the 1.5 % low of 2005 , but half the 7.5 % average recorded in the last three decades of the twentieth century .
moreover , the debt overhang remains massive .
the european currency crises of 1992 and 1993 , as well as more recent chaotic demonetizations elsewhere , show that a successful transition was far from guaranteed .
a second early success was that , by virtually all measures of international use , the euro instantly became the world ’s second global reserve currency .
moreover , the desire to be admitted to the club led to favorable reforms in many aspiring member countries , particularly the central and eastern european countries that later joined the european union .
more recent entries on the “ success ” side of the ledger include the progress of some periphery countries , particularly spain , reducing their previously uncompetitive unit labor costs .
ecb president mario draghi deserves top marks for balancing germany ’s demand for fiscal discipline and the mediterranean need for accommodation .
if she is unlucky , the crisis will come to a head at the start of the german election year , and all previous calculations could be moot , because , despite germans ’ frustration with europe , the electorate would punish severely those who allowed europe to fail .
the european union ’s economy is sliding into a severe and , in all likelihood , long-lasting recession , largely self-inflicted .
while germany is still trying to banish the specter of hyperinflation with strict eurozone austerity measures , the eu crisis countries are facing a real threat of deflation , with potentially disastrous consequences .
it is only a question of time – no longer very much time – before economic destabilization gives rise to political instability .
hungary , where democratic backsliding appears to be taking hold , provides a foretaste of a europe in which the eurozone crisis and deflation persist .
even today , thanks to a variety of sophisticated means , we can detect very small nuclear tests in remote locations .
the treaty is also fair — it includes the same rights and responsibilities for all its parties .
it sets a new standard for nuclear weapons treaty obligations and verification .
the ctbt is needed because of the role of nuclear tests in the development and improvement of nuclear weapons .
such tests are also political symbols that have no place in a world determined to eliminate these abhorrent weapons of mass destruction .
we need leaders with sufficient mastery of detail , like china ’s last premier zhu rongji , who can not only tell us how they will get us from a to z , but can actually lead us from a to b.
looking around , leaders like this seem to be an extinct species .
or , if they exist at all , they appear to be constrained by dysfunctional political systems .
their ability to act is limited by their political environment .
the best example is us president barack obama , on whom so many hopes rested – probably too many for any one leader .
today , palestinians are seeking statehood on a mere 22 % of the territory that had been part of mandatory palestine until israel was unilaterally established on areas much larger than those awarded by un general assembly resolution 181 in 1947 .
palestine ’s quest for statehood within the borders of june 4 , 1967 , falls squarely within international law .
the un security council resolved in november of that year that “ acquisition of territory by war ” is unacceptable .
subsequent security council resolutions and international treaties have upheld this principle .
in fact , a palestinian state based on the 1967 borders is exactly what us president barack obama has called for .
indeed , some argue that the inventiveness and internationalism of a world networked by interests and shared causes is likely to be more resilient than one crammed into the artificial – and increasingly constraining – box of the national state .
in that sense , economic success in china or india may be those states ’ undoing , as middle-class political aspirations render current arrangements dysfunctional .
conversely , we may find ourselves in a world whose eastern half is organized into strong authoritarian state structures , with the west embracing post-state models of association .
the question for international governance is how to provide a framework of institutions and rules in a world of competing organizational structures .
the politicians ’ answer is depressingly predictable : in the face of a resurgent russia and china , this is no time to abandon our own states and diplomacy to their fate .
the anti-corruption campaign reflects the ccp ’s apparent determination to rid itself of vested interests .
at its 2013 third plenum , the ccp announced 60 goals for economic and governance reforms .
many hope that these changes will help the ccp become more effective , strengthen the role of the market , and avoid the so-called middle-income trap that has ensnared many emerging countries .
however , the party ’s rhetoric reveals little about how these goals will be achieved .
indeed , there are worrying signs that the principal architect of the reform agenda , the respected free-market economist li keqiang , is already being sidelined .
such flows should be shut down both by governments and financial institutions .
curtailing the flow of recruits is even more essential .
countries can do more to make it difficult for individuals to leave for iraq or syria ; a europe-wide watch list , for example , would help .
but nothing would have a greater impact than turkey deciding that it will no longer allow itself to be a conduit , and that it will enforce united nations security council resolution 2178 , which calls for stronger international cooperation against terrorism .
another component of any strategy must be to counter is 's appeal and propaganda .
political technology means secretly sponsoring fake politicians like bogdanov , setting up fake ngo ’s and “ patriotic ” youth movements like nashi ( ours ) to prevent a russian version of ukraine ’s orange revolution , and mobilizing voters against a carefully scripted “ enemy . ”
in 1996 , the enemy was the communists ; in 1999-2000 , the chechens ; in 2003-04 , the “ oligarchs . ”
now it is us – the supposedly hostile west and the threat posed by “ color revolutions ” to russia ’s hard-won stability .
medvedev himself may find some or all of this distasteful , but russia now has an entire industry of political manipulation that is hardly likely to disappear overnight .
we also need to understand the mechanics of russian succession politics .
so our task was not only to reconstruct the state , but society too -- its family values , its national traditions and cultural heritage .
our newly freed societies must now learn the languages of our constituent parts , just as we learned a new economic and political language .
through learning each other 's languages , through cooperation based on shared values , common interests as well as historical ties , central europe has demonstrated what spectacular results can be achieved .
the visegrád group , cefta , the central european initiative have produced a thriving free trade system and an increasing flow of investment between countries in the region .
in a broader context , hungary 's re-integration into western institutional structures is proceeding steadily if not at the desired pace .
in 1988 , conservationists decided to finance and build an electrified fence to protect an area of the aberdare national park bordering smallholder farms .
the fence was designed to prevent intrusion from the human population and degradation of the park ’s habitat .
but it also protected the farmers , whose crops were regularly being destroyed by marauding elephant and other wildlife .
local farmers welcomed the initiative , which influenced the decision to expand the fence to surround the perimeter of the entire aberdare range .
the aberdare mountains , encompassing 2,000 square kilometers of indigenous forest and vital water catchment areas , as well as a national park , are vital to kenya .
these protests have two major causes .
first , social inequality has grown unabated in the west over the last quarter-century , owing in part to the disappearance of the soviet union and , with it , the threat of expansionist communism .
the specter of revolution had forced western elites to use the power of the state to redistribute wealth and nurture the growth of loyal middle classes .
but , when communism collapsed in its eurasian heartland , the west ’s rich , believing that they had nothing more to fear , pressed to roll back the welfare state , causing inequality to rise rapidly .
this was tolerable as long as the overall pie was expanding , but the global financial crisis in 2008 ended that .
in 1998 , the un estimated the total value of the illicit drug trade at $ 400 billion , or 7 % of global trade .
critics say the figure is only half that - still a remarkable sum .
colombia today is far worse than chicago under al capone .
so , too , are other latin american , caribbean and asian countries .
drug prohibition effectively imposes a tax on the global trade in illicit drugs that is enforced by governments and collected by those willing to violate the laws .
tatiana insisted that bam construction was started in 1974 , the politically correct date , after which “ clean labor ” was used .
but the railway ’s first section – initiated by stalin to offer an eastern route that ran farther away from the chinese border – was built by forced labor , including russian inmates and german and japanese prisoners of war , herded together in so-called bamlags , now ghost towns .
even when volunteers were used , they were not nearly as enthusiastic as official accounts claim .
lacking adequate housing and electricity , few re-enlisted , and many deserted before completing their term .
nonetheless , the brezhnev-era bam construction showed what that dying soviet system was still capable of achieving .
and with support at around 26-29 % , it remains popular despite its poor performance running the city council of rome .
the problem for m5s is that , owing to a new electoral law , it will have to win roughly 40 % of the total vote to secure a parliamentary majority .
whereas proportional representation will determine two-thirds of seats in the lower house , one-third will be decided by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies , where the m5s will likely lose out , because it is neither willing nor able to form the electoral alliances needed to secure majorities .
in fact , the party grouping that will benefit the most from the current electoral system will be the only one that has managed to forge a pre-election pact with other parties : the berlusconi-led center right .
as he demonstrated with his election victories in 1994 , 2001 , and 2008 , berlusconi ’s greatest strength has always been building coalitions .
the upa ’s critics long claimed that unsustainably low , state-dictated passenger fares and freight charges for rail services – which could not cover the cost of maintenance to ensure the safety of trains and tracks , much less enable expansion and improvement of service – reflected the government ’s inability to make tough decisions .
it is true that coalition politics prevented decisive action , with a railway minister being summarily dismissed by his own party leader – whom the upa was politically unable to confront – after attempting to raise fares .
but , in the pre-election interim budget , the upa government finally bit the bullet , proposing a 14.2 % increase in rail fares and a 6.5 % hike in freight rates .
per india ’s code of political conduct , the budget changes were deferred until after the election .
soon after taking office , the modi government announced its intention to implement the price increases , though officials made sure to emphasize that they were merely following through on an existing mandate .
under the approved bill , muslim immigrants may be declared illegal .
coupled with the government ’s plan to create an even more problematic national register of citizens , the authorities will be able to disenfranchise any indian muslim who is unable to prove his or her provenance in india .
many indians , especially the poor , lack documentary evidence of when and where they were born ; even birth certificates have become widespread only in recent decades .
while non-muslims would , thanks to the approved bill , get a free pass , similarly undocumented muslims would suddenly bear the onus of proving that they are indian .
this marks a breathtaking departure from seven decades of practice in managing an astonishing degree of cultural diversity .
having just emerged from a deep recession , financial disruptions could easily cause europe to slide back into recession , particularly given the eurozone economy ’s close links to russia via trade and energy .
compounding the problem , no one truly understands the precise connections among russian and european institutions and markets .
the collapse of ltcm in 1998 was completely unexpected .
is europe today prepared to deal with a similar failure of an important financial institution ?
the financial sanctions on russia are not targeted , temporary , or fully credible .
gdp has nearly tripled over the past 20 years , but , with real wages rising at less than half this rate , growth has become decoupled from the fate of ordinary citizens .
more than half of middle-income households spend more each month than they earn .
the signs of social distress are multiplying .
south korea ’s divorce rate has doubled , fertility rates have fallen to the fourth lowest among advanced economies , and the suicide rate is the highest in the oecd .
south korea is troubled for two key reasons .
this may mean eliminating shadowy “ tax havens , ” tapping phone lines , and identifying individuals considered highly dangerous .
police actions must be merciless , even if this means more controls and surveillance .
it is precisely to prevent the development of a collective security fear that we need to alter the equilibrium between security and freedom .
while the european union lags behind the united states in terms of conventional weapons , its capacity to fight terrorism is probably higher .
for historical reasons , europe benefits from a political maturity that has allowed it to avoid bush ’s manichean worldview , which has merely reinforced , rather than undermined , the enemy ’s fanaticism .
ross should read mehrsa baradaran ’s informative book , how the other half banks , and reflect on the high cost of credit for low-income families .
or he could just ask mick mulvaney , the acting white house chief of staff .
while in the house of representatives , mulvaney received large donations from the payday loan industry , which makes most of its profits from lending at high interest rates to people who have no alternative when they desperately need cash .
mulvaney also devoted considerable time over the past two years to weakening the safeguards that the consumer financial protection bureau previously attempted to implement to prevent some of the industry ’s worst abuses .
as the government shutdown lengthened , the stock price of payday lenders rose .
seoul – a vast revolution in military affairs is taking place across east asia .
the latest signs are chinese president xi jinping ’s purge of general xu caihou , an ex-politburo member and former vice-chairman of the central military commission , on charges of corruption , and japan ’s “ reinterpretation ” of article 9 of its constitution to permit the country to provide military aid to its allies .
despite the rising regional tensions that inspired these moves , china ’s relations with its neighbors and the united states are not fated to lead to direct confrontation .
but the relentless march of new initiatives to meet the perceived “ china threat ” will require the region ’s political leaders , including the chinese , to address their disputes in new and more creative ways if that outcome is to be avoided .
in general , there are three ways to foster international peace : deepening economic interdependence , promoting democracy , and building international institutions .
new haven – the severity of the global financial crisis that we have seen over the last two years has to do with a fundamental source of instability in the banking system , one that we can and must design out of existence .
to do that , we must advance the state of our financial technology .
in a serious financial crisis , banks find that the declining market value of many of their assets leaves them short of capital .
they can not raise much more capital during the crisis , so , in order to restore capital adequacy , they stop making new loans and call in their outstanding loans , thereby throwing the entire economy – if not the entire global economy – into a tailspin .
this problem is rather technical in nature , as are its solutions .
yet , having enjoyed a huge subsidy from moscow , kadyrov has rebuilt grozny and provided it with some security .
kadyrov also catered to the spiritual aspirations of the chechen majority .
he rejected wahhabism – the ideological framework of the jihadists .
but he maintained that islam is an essential part of the chechen tradition and presented himself as a leader who fully understood this .
so he encouraged an islamic dress code and built a huge mosque – one of the biggest , if not the biggest , in europe .
village housing must be provided at a massive level .
roads , airports and communications systems must also be revitalized if trade is to be restored .
the educational system needs to be rebuilt almost from scratch , and with so many women anxious to return to teaching , a revived educational system will also help afghanistan 's democratic politicians gain a powerful lobby of workers .
particular attention should be given to elementary schools and libraries outside of cities .
afghanistan poses particular difficulties in reconstruction , as it is not a society with a strong political center .
what i have just described is no mere hypothetical , of course .
it is , in fact , a capsule depiction of the united states federal reserve and the european central bank .
one popular explanation for the two banks ’ different approaches is that they stem from their societies ’ respective historical experiences .
the banks ’ institutional personalities reflect the role of collective memory in shaping how officials conceptualize the problems that they face .
the great depression of the 1930 ’s , when the fed stood idly by as the economy collapsed , is the molding event seared into the consciousness of every american central banker .
not one of his new york times commentaries in the first half of 2013 , when “ austerian ” deficit cutting was taking effect , forecast a major reduction in unemployment or that economic growth would recover to brisk rates .
on the contrary , “ the disastrous turn toward austerity has destroyed millions of jobs and ruined many lives , ” he argued , with the us congress exposing americans to “ the imminent threat of severe economic damage from short-term spending cuts . ”
as a result , “ full recovery still looks a very long way off , ” he warned .
“ and i ’m beginning to worry that it may never happen . ”
i raise all of this because krugman took a victory lap in his end-of-2014 column on “ the obama recovery . ”
even though many of them are in trouble , it ’s probably not the best time to start a new car company , either .
yet while the market for new cars has slowed dramatically , it could be a good time to start a business replacing gasoline engines with electric ones .
the group ’s initiative , led by räsänen , is called ecars - now !
a small operation in finland , it is less a company than a role model for companies that the team hopes will spring up worldwide .
borrowing from the open-software movement , räsänen and his colleagues want to make the idea and the basic designs free , and encourage lots of companies all over the world to implement it locally .
but i think that there is more wishful thinking than hardheaded logic among those calling for a “ color revolution . ”
consider , for example , that no one has ever developed a precise way to measure whether and to what extent a government is effective .
if the criterion of effectiveness is the ability to achieve all of a society ’s goals , we will probably never find such a thing .
the united states , with a government that can hardly be described as weak , bungled the war in iraq and the aftermath of hurricane katrina .
compared to these failures , vladimir putin ’s achievements in chechnya look like the height of success .
these and other funding streams have helped african researchers develop drought-resistant crops , produce vaccines for infectious diseases like ebola , and expand opportunities for science and technology education .
unfortunately , many african governments lack the resources to fund programs that could build on these gains .
simply put , a new , more collaborative approach to african science is urgently needed .
africa ’s leaders have pooled their science resources before .
in 2003 , the african union and the new partnership for africa ’s development began implementing a continent-wide strategy “ to develop and use science and technology for the socioeconomic transformation of the continent and its integration into the world economy . ”
london – five years after the collapse of the us investment bank lehman brothers , the world has still not addressed the fundamental cause of the subsequent financial crisis – an excess of debt .
and that is why economic recovery has progressed much more slowly than anyone expected ( in some countries , it has not come at all ) .
most economists , central bankers , and regulators not only failed to foresee the crisis , but also believed that financial stability was assured so long as inflation was low and stable .
and , once the immediate crisis had been contained , we failed to foresee how painful its consequences would be .
official forecasts in the spring of 2009 anticipated neither a slow recovery nor that the initial crisis , which was essentially confined to the united states and the united kingdom , would soon fuel a knock-on crisis in the eurozone .
the big difference is that the uk will lose its voice at the table .
for britons in the “ remain ” camp , such a transition will allow the uk to stay in the eu in all but name .
and for some of those in the “ leave ” camp , it is a way to exit without falling off a cliff edge .
the third agreement in phase two will center around a roadmap for uk-eu relations after 2021 .
this will not be a free-trade agreement , but rather a political declaration about where both sides hope to end up .
the islamic world is riven by disputes between arab and non-arab , sunni and shia , and salafi extremists and theological moderates .
al qaeda ’s agenda is as much about the creation of a new islamic caliphate as it is about waging jihad against the west .
fourth , europeans find it hard to stomach traditional islamic attitudes towards , say , women or homosexuals .
muslims find it hard to understand how we can believe our society is civilized when pornography and drunkenness are openly displayed .
to the extent that europeans are christian at all , we see religion as a matter of an individual ’s relationship with his or her god ; muslims see it as an organizing social principle .
yanukovych had always been the kremlin ’s ally .
indeed , his election in 2010 marked the end of ukraine ’s pro-european orange revolution , which had defeated his effort to steal the presidential election in 2004 and keep ukraine in the russian camp .
so why did the eu press for an association agreement , without being able to offer ukraine anything comparable to what russia offered ?
the answer can be found in the relationship between europe and russia .
with the collapse of the soviet union , russia not only lost its status as a world power ; within europe , it was forced to withdraw toward a frontier that it had extended westward since peter the great – ultimately to the elbe and thuringia .
what is needed for high performance ?
basically , it is productive change , which i call economic dynamism .
for employees to develop , they must be imbedded in a stimulating workplace , with new problems to solve , harder tasks to be mastered , added abilities to strive for .
less obviously , a country does not want misguided or pointless change ; it wants investments that appear to the financial sector as productive .
the late 1990 's produced evidence that low dynamism was associated with weak economic performance , particularly low prosperity .
first , because most technology-based monopoly power does not violate existing antitrust laws , regulating it will require new measures to weaken monopolies .
new concepts of the public interest are also needed for regulating new public information channels such as social networks .
second , standard views of business income and wealth taxation will need to be adapted to account for it firms ’ monopoly power .
and , third , laws intended to protect private information should be reevaluated to ensure that it companies are unable to profit from exploiting and manipulating it .
above all , the public must develop a deeper understanding of the economic effects of it , particularly how technologies that have improved the lives of so many are enriching the lives of so few .
geneva – with france launching its third “ humanitarian ” military operation in as many years – this time in the central african republic – interventionism , which seemed discredited after the us invasion of iraq , seems to have returned as an accepted norm in international affairs .
indeed , decades of relentless intervention have shifted the terms of debate , with recent operations justified by their achievability rather than their merit .
to understand how this shift occurred is to see why , more often than not , such intervention has failed to attain its objectives .
as france ’s recent actions demonstrate , intervention nowadays requires nothing more than a unilateral decree of humanitarian or counter-terrorism objectives , an atmosphere of urgency , and an ambiguous link to ongoing united nations deliberations .
a military operation might also be referred to the un security council , but only after the fact , when the council ’s decision can no longer significantly affect events on the ground .
he argues that economists became blind to catastrophic macro failure because they mistook the beauty or elegance of theoretical models for truth .
both coase and krugman bemoan the neglect of their profession ’s patrimony – a tradition dating at least to adam smith – that valued grand and unifying theories of political economy and moral philosophy .
the contemporary obsession with reductionist and mechanical models seems to have driven the profession from theory toward ideology , putting it out of touch with the real economy .
the simplicity and elegance of micro and macro models make them useful in explaining the price mechanism and the balance or imbalance of key aggregate economic variables .
but both models are unable to describe or analyze the actual behavior of key market participants .
after all , such no-strings-attached databases do not just facilitate sharing ; they enable stealing .
the question of how to regulate access to genetic sequence data is now cropping up in international discussions , including at the world health organization and the food and agriculture organization .
perhaps the most important forum for such discussions is the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity , the main treaty regulating access to biodiversity .
the next meeting ( cop 13 ) will take place in cancún , mexico , in early december .
participants at cop 13 must focus on the need to protect the rights of resource providers .
demand growth at a pace that in any previous decade would have been seen as highly satisfactory is suddenly desperately insufficient , and bush is being blamed ( with some justice ) for the slack labor market that has resulted .
but for everyone except bush - and those left unemployed by the lag in demand - it is an extraordinary opportunity .
the remarkable boosts to productivity that have been within america 's grasp will ultimately lead to accelerating growth of real profits and real wages , if only us policy makers resist the temptation to pursue politically expedient , but economically damaging , measures to " protect " output and employment .
as the world 's leading-edge economy , america faces the hardest work in ensuring growth , for it must create - not only copy and adapt - new technologies , better forms of capital , and more productive business organizations .
if america can grow as fast as it is now , that is very good news for other , less-developed economies , especially since one powerful effect of ongoing technological revolutions in computers and communications is to make it much easier to participate in the global division of labor now centered in the us .
to avoid another public backlash , they must make these platforms serve us not only as consumers , but also as entrepreneurs , workers , and citizens .
at a time of unprecedented global challenges – including climate change and high levels of inequality – this must include using the unprecedented power of platform leadership to catalyze global-scale solutions .
earlier this year , the artificial-meat producer beyond meat celebrated a rapturous stock-market debut .
rather than focus on meeting rising demand for meat by scaling up factory-farming operations , as companies did in the past , it – and similar companies , such as impossible foods – is working to help reduce overall meat consumption , a major driver of climate change .
this is propelling the latest transition in corporate stakeholdership , focused not just on scaling more wisely , but also on becoming wiser about what to scale .
ontario – this december , trade ministers from around the world will converge in buenos aires for the world trade organization ’s 11th ministerial conference .
with the united states , which has historically led the world toward trade liberalization , now actively stoking trade tensions , the meeting is set to be unlike any other .
the wto ’s ministerial gatherings are never easy .
some kind of agreement is usually delivered , but only at the last minute , and its language is often vague .
this time , however , the outcome might be even more disappointing , with delegates unable to reach even a symbolic agreement that they can tout with an aggressive marketing campaign .
poland introduced such a law in 1998 .
similar norms exist in the czech republic , hungary , latvia , and lithuania .
by obscuring the role that local populations played in both nazi and communist crimes , such laws help to advance nationalist narratives , which can prove very handy for politicians looking to win popular support .
the pis , for one , has accrued substantial electoral support , thanks in part to its exploitation of past tragedies for political ends .
there are more extreme cases than that of poland .
instead , the reform proposals have opted for a mixture of higher capital requirements for leading banks and pre-funding of deposit insurance by a special levy on banks .
there seems to be little appetite for proposals to vary capital adequacy requirements counter-cyclically .
this would enable capital buffers to be created in good years , which could then be drawn down in bad years .
admittedly , there are difficulties with all proposals to restrict the scope of “ risky ” banking , especially in the context of a global economy with free capital mobility .
as is frequently pointed out , unless banking regulations are identical across frontiers , there will be plenty of scope for “ regulatory arbitrage . ”
new york – the us patient protection and affordable care act , president barack obama ’s signature 2010 health-care reform , has succeeded in extending insurance coverage to millions of americans who would not otherwise have it .
and , contrary to critics ’ warnings , it has not pushed up health-care costs ; in fact , there is some hope that the cost curve may finally be bending downward .
but whether “ obamacare ” succeeds in curbing excessively high health-care costs is not assured .
that will depend on the obama administration ’s other policies , particularly in an area that might seem unrelated : the united states ’ ongoing discussions with india over intellectual property .
and here , obama appears determined to undermine his own signature reform , owing to pressure from the powerful us pharmaceutical lobby .
likewise , cutting fiscal support ( via government-directed bank lending ) to zombie firms would free up fiscal capacity and enable resources to be redirected to new sectors that facilitate services and urban employment ; but this would exacerbate – at least at first – today ’s demand shortfall .
slashing the state sector abruptly and expecting to achieve transformation through austerity is not the way forward .
economic historians , notably michael a. bernstein in his study of the great depression in the united states , have convincingly shown that an economy in transition requires strong aggregate demand to pull resources into new sectors .
if both the old and new sectors of an economy are in a slump , capital formation will sputter , investment in upgrading human capital will decline , and structural adjustment will stall .
robust aggregate demand is always essential to successful transformation .
london – how radically will digital currencies change our methods of exchange and the way that we think about money ?
with innovation in digital payments barreling ahead , these questions are now commanding the attention of the world economic forum and other international institutions .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
bangalore – us secretary of state john kerry ’s valiant effort to save the israeli-palestinian peace process is about to end in failure .
though achieving a substantive settlement was always a pipe dream , this latest disappointment will render the united states unable to preserve even the façade of a “ peace process ” that was all process and no peace .
and that might not be such a bad thing .
the negotiations are failing for several reasons , beginning with israel ’s continued colonization of lands occupied in 1967 , despite opposition from the international community , including the us .
if anything , israel has accelerated settlement construction since the latest round of talks began , while escalating its demands , especially regarding the stationing of israeli troops in the jordan valley .
her request was refused , as was her earlier plea in 2006 to suspend her sentence until her two small sons reached the age of 14 – a request she was entitled to make under russian law .
vasily aleksanyan was executive vice president of yukos , and , as a lawyer , defended khodorkovsky and his partner , platon lebedev , after their arrest in 2003 .
he was subsequently disbarred and was himself arrested in april 2006 .
by that time , aleksanyan was critically ill with aids , for which treatment was withheld .
in december 2008 , the moscow city court approved his release on bail of 50 million rubles ( around $ 1,775,000 at the time ) .
moreover , they need it to happen by the end of the year to prevent further damage from big tariff hikes currently scheduled to take effect on december 15 .
that timeline requires that both sides start taking symbolic and substantive steps immediately .
as a first step , china should propose an agreement using the same text as the previous 150-page draft , but with revisions to satisfy its three “ red lines . ”
specifically , china should remove the us provisions for retaining tariffs after the agreement is signed , and for unilaterally re-imposing tariffs if the us concludes that china is not honoring the agreement .
and it should add a commitment that china will execute the agreement in a way that is “ consistent with its constitutional , legislative , and regulatory processes . ”
princeton – most of today ’s advanced economies became what they are by traveling the well-worn path of industrialization .
a progression of manufacturing industries – textiles , steel , automobiles – emerged from the ashes of the traditional craft and guild systems , transforming agrarian societies into urban ones .
peasants became factory workers , a process that underpinned not only an unprecedented rise in economic productivity , but also a wholesale revolution in social and political organization .
the labor movement led to mass politics , and ultimately to political democracy .
over time , manufacturing ceded its place to services .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
and , of course , this average does not include the fukushima catastrophe .
indeed , when compared to other energy sources , nuclear power ranks higher than oil , coal , and natural gas systems in terms of fatalities , second only to hydroelectric dams .
there have been 57 accidents since the chernobyl disaster in 1986 .
while only a few involved fatalities , those that did collectively killed more people than have died in commercial us airline accidents since 1982 .
another index of nuclear-power accidents – this one including costs beyond death and property damage , such as injured or irradiated workers and malfunctions that did not result in shutdowns or leaks – documented 956 incidents from 1942 to 2007 .
this may no longer be so easy , once the us is no longer seen as a reliable protector and fear of china turns into a panic .
unlike some of her predecessors as chancellor , merkel , who grew up in east germany , is wary of russia ’s strategic designs .
there is no doubt that russia and china will benefit , at least in the short term , from america ’s abdication of leadership .
some people are not too bothered by this .
russia is closer to berlin or even paris than washington or new york .
but , if a deal is negotiated well , the end result brings significantly more benefits than costs .
and that would have been the case with the colombian accord , which addresses a vast array of social and economic issues , including problems affecting indigenous communities , gender equality , gay rights , and the millions of people displaced by more than a half-century of fighting .
the deal also included an historic land-reform program .
for uribe and his opposition allies , the main objection to the deal concerns how it addresses the question of transitional justice .
negotiators decided that the unconditional application of justice would not be possible .
for example , the us was wrong to invade iraq in 2003 , but it was right to join the fight against isis , and to rescue the yazidis from a massacre .
it was right to attack the occupied city of mosul , but it was wrong to reduce the city to dust .
it was also wrong to call for the overthrow of syrian president bashar al-assad ’s regime , because the forces opposed to assad lacked the necessary popular support , and the us was not prepared to help them win that support .
on the other hand , helping the syrian kurds was a good idea , because they were effective fighters with strong support from their own people ; and they probably would not have survived under an isis caliphate .
elsewhere , it is right to strengthen south korean and japanese defenses , but obviously wrong to threaten a nuclear war .
the trouble began at the end of the cold war , when the collapse of a bankrupt communist ideology was complacently interpreted as the triumph of the market .
as communism was discarded , so was the concept of the state as an agent around which our collective interests and ambitions could be organized .
the individual became the ultimate agent of change – an individual conceived as the type of rational actor that populates economists ’ models .
such an individual ’s identity is not derived from class interests or other sociological characteristics , but from the logic of the market , which dictates maximization of self-interest , whether as a producer , a consumer , or a voter .
indeed , economics has been placed on a pedestal and enshrined in institutions like central banks and competition authorities , which have been intentionally separated and made independent from politics .
madrid june ’s turkish general election sent a powerful message : turkey ’s democracy remains intact .
indeed , while there were some grievances about transparency during the campaign process , democracy prevailed , with a stunning 86 % of eligible voters turning out – a rate rarely seen in europe .
the rest of the world – and especially the european union – should take note .
with their votes , turkey ’s citizens denied the ruling justice and development party ( akp ) the absolute majority that it needed to amend the constitution .
moreover , by giving the peoples ’ democratic party ( hdp ) – which brings together the country ’s long-marginalized kurdish minority and other groups – more than 10 % of the vote , they enabled the party to enter parliament for the first time , with representation throughout the country , not just in kurd-majority areas .
if an application is successful , a refugee has the right to bring along his or her family members as well .
frequently , arab families send their minors to germany in the not-unjustified hope that they will obtain the right for other family members to follow later .
germany will have to deal with the consequences of this refugee wave for years to come .
in order to distribute the burden more equitably , germany tried to have a european quota system instituted to allocate applicants among the eu ’s member countries .
but germany ’s eu partners rejected this as “ moral imperialism . ”
washington , dc – anyone watching the united states ’ presidential race needs to understand that national opinion polls do not provide an accurate picture of how the election might turn out .
thanks to america ’s electoral college , it ’s not who wins the most votes nationwide that matters in the end , but who wins in which states .
each state is awarded a certain number of votes in the electoral college , depending on the size of its population .
the candidate who crosses the threshold of 270 electoral votes wins the presidency .
in almost every state , a candidate who wins 50.1 % of the popular vote is awarded 100 % of its electoral votes .
new york – the prospect that the us federal reserve will start exiting zero policy rates later this year has fueled growing fear of renewed volatility in emerging economies ’ currency , bond , and stock markets .
the concern is understandable : when the fed signaled in 2013 that the end of its quantitative-easing ( qe ) policy was forthcoming , the resulting “ taper tantrum ” sent shock waves through many emerging countries ’ financial markets and economies .
indeed , rising interest rates in the united states and the ensuing likely rise in the value of the dollar could , it is feared , wreak havoc among emerging markets ’ governments , financial institutions , corporations , and even households .
because all have borrowed trillions of dollars in the last few years , they will now face an increase in the real local-currency value of these debts , while rising us rates will push emerging markets ’ domestic interest rates higher , thus increasing debt-service costs further .
but , although the prospect of the fed raising interest rates is likely to create significant turbulence in emerging countries ’ financial markets , the risk of outright crises and distress is more limited .
faced with american unilateralism , he failed to promote realistic multilateral solutions .
on the contrary , despite being right about iraq , chirac became isolated , an isolation that grew because he also failed to re-establish satisfactory relations with president bush .
indeed , under chirac , france appears increasingly arrogant , a nation convinced of the righteousness of its views and the universality of its model - the very charges so often levelled against george w. bush 's america .
chirac compounded his errors over iraq in his approach to the new european commission .
on the old commission headed by romano prodi , france was powerfully represented , with pascal lamy holding the trade portfolio .
and the expanding global population – set to reach more than 9.5 billion by 2050 – will strain water resources still further .
urgent action is needed to ensure access to safe , affordable water and sanitation for all .
first , drastic improvements in water-related services – including supply and sanitation , irrigation and drainage , energy , and environmental facilities – are needed to improve health outcomes and enable more people to escape poverty .
governments should take the lead in ensuring careful management and sustainable use of scarce water resources .
water-intensive food and energy production – among others – are dependent on uninterrupted supplies .
while iran ’s leaders have often downplayed the sanctions ’ impact , president mahmoud ahmadinejad has recently cited them as the primary culprit behind iran ’s economic turmoil .
but iran has faced similar economic difficulties before – in the 1980 ’s , oil exports fell significantly amid the country ’s eight-year war with iraq , and in 1986-2000 global oil prices were extremely low – and handled them relatively well .
four factors have made the oil embargo particularly unbearable today .
first , prohibiting oil exports is more painful when world oil prices are rising .
ahmadinejad has benefited from a massive increase in the price of oil , resulting in unprecedented earnings .
not only has iran developed its nuclear capabilities while a party to the npt , the israelis will say , but it also has put israel ’s destruction high on its agenda .
israel ’s nuclear deterrence is its ultimate defense against an existential threat .
across-the-board nuclear equality can , in the end , only boost to iran ’s nuclear claims .
india and pakistan , unlike israel , which has been committed to a strategy of nuclear opacity , both see themselves as nuclear states and want the world to accept that status . moreover , israel never tested a nuclear weapon , and has unequivocally accepted the nuclear suppliers group ( nsg ) guidelines , which seek to stem proliferation through the control of nuclear exports .
israel expects the obama administration not only to appreciate the unique context of its ambiguous nuclear status , but also to recognize that it can not be forthcoming in assuring its neighbors or the rest of the world regarding its nuclear program unless the middle east political environment changes in a radically positive way .
whatever the ultimate economic effects of china ’s first modest step towards floating its currency , one has to admire its strategic brilliance .
the genius of china ’s mini-move ( allowing the yuan to rise 2 % against the dollar ) is that no one can tell when or what is going to happen next .
protectionists in the united states and europe , itching to slap huge punitive tariffs on chinese goods , have been caught flat-footed .
they want to keep bathing in press coverage , but if they push their china-bashing too far and too fast , the protectionists will be seen as hindering delicate behind-the-scenes negotiations .
but no one knows whether china ’s baby step is the start of something much bigger , as china ’s authorities hint one day and deny the next .
and here , obama , in particular , will soon understand that hollande has no intention of bringing sweeping change .
on the contrary , his intention will be to appear as a reliable and unsurprising partner .
hollande is unlikely to be less friendly with america than was sarkozy , regarded by many as france ’s most pro-us president .
hollande supported the military intervention in libya in 2011 , and has joined the condemnation of syrian president bashar al-assad ’s regime .
one of his close political allies recently declared that should the united nations security council approve military intervention in syria , france “ could envision ” participating in that effort .
deflation -- a steady ongoing decline in prices -- gave businesses and consumers powerful incentives to cut spending and hoard cash .
it reduced the ability of businesses and banks to service their debt , and might trigger a chain of big bankruptcies that would destroy confidence in the financial system , providing further incentives to hoard .
such strong incentives to hoard rather than spend can keep demand low and falling , and unemployment high and rising , for a much longer time than even the most laissez-faire-oriented politician or economist had ever dared contemplate .
hence the keynesian solution : use monetary policy ( lower interest rates ) and fiscal policy ( expanded government spending and reduced taxes ) to keep the economy from ever approaching the precipice where deflation becomes possible .
but if this is an issue solved over fifty years ago , why is it haunting us now ?
and of the 50 million children who live outside their own countries or have been internally displaced , more than half have been forcibly uprooted , and are facing new threats to their lives and well-being .
millions of children are undernourished and out of school ; millions have witnessed unspeakable brutality ; and millions are threatened with exploitation , abuse , and worse .
this is not rhetoric ; it is reality .
the united nations – with support from countries such as sweden , and by working through a coordinated humanitarian-response system that includes unicef – is alleviating suffering whenever and wherever it can .
but the quantity and complexity of cascading crises are testing that system as never before .
to this end , a coalition of african countries , supported by the united nations economic commission for africa and the new climate economy , is working to facilitate meaningful , coordinated action that puts the entire continent on a more inclusive and sustainable growth path .
partnerships with national finance and planning ministers , relevant development-finance institutions , and the private sector will support this process .
overcoming the formidable challenge that climate change poses to africa will depend on moments of collective focus and clarity .
the un secretary-general ’s climate summit next month should be just such a moment , with countries committing to step up their emissions-reduction targets under the 2015 paris climate agreement , so as to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century .
given their heightened vulnerability , african countries have every incentive to set the bar high , thereby putting pressure on others to ramp up their own contributions .
the rejection of the european union ’s constitutional treaty by french and dutch voters was , according to all evidence , more a rejection of unregulated globalization than it was a rejection of europe .
the general instability of social relations – most importantly , but not only , of employment – is slowly becoming intolerable for a growing part of the population in many developed countries , not just in europe .
and there can not be a stable economic order – at least not in democratic countries – if electorates reject its underpinnings .
capitalism could be reconstructed after world war ii because it was buttressed by three necessary types of regulation : social security , which served as a principal stabilizer , at least in the developed countries ; keynesian tools to fight domestic cyclical downturns ; and a universal high-wage policy aimed at stimulating general consumption , without which the genius of capitalism – mass production – does not work .
but the realignment of the rich , developed countries around the monetarist policies promoted by economists like milton friedman , which began around 1970 , broke with all that .
at the same time , in an age of internet rumors and fake news , the world today can look a little unmoored from history .
that might create a sense of real risk .
inflation targeting has other effects , too , which seem to be more on the minds of central bankers .
in his influential 1998 book inflation targeting , ben bernanke and his co-authors advised policymakers to announce a target inflation rate because it “ communicates the central bank ’s intentions , ” which would “ reduce uncertainty . ”
the announced rate should be substantially positive , they wrote , because if officials tried to get it close to zero , any mistake could result in deflation , which “ might endanger the financial system and precipitate an economic contraction . ”
berkeley – with its ambitious made in china 2025 strategy , china has made clear its objective to secure global economic leadership in advanced technology industries .
this places it in direct competition with the united states – which currently leads in those industries – in what is emerging as an undeclared but intensifying cold war over technologies with both commercial and military applications .
with its investments in such dual-use technologies , china is seeking more than to compete commercially with the us ; it is also seeking greater military and geopolitical power .
and it has deployed a variety of methods – including weak intellectual property ( ip ) protections , technology transfers as a condition for joint ventures with chinese partners , evasion of export controls , and regulatory harassment – to acquire such technologies from the us and other trading partners .
china ’s intentions and practices have long been an irritant in sino-american relations .
the berlin wall had fallen , bringing german reunification , and yugoslavia was disintegrating .
soon after , czechoslovakia ’s “ velvet divorce ” gave rise to the czech republic and slovakia , which – together with other central and eastern european countries ( including hungary and poland ) – then anchored themselves firmly in the west by joining nato and the eu .
today , a trade war would damage all economies .
but the us – which is relatively less dependent on foreign markets , possesses deeper domestic markets , and is generally more economically resilient than other countries – would do better than most others in a contracting world economy .
already , chinese financial markets have suffered , while those in the us have held their own .
the treaty would promote stability in the irish economy and contribute to stabilizing the euro , our currency .
it would increase confidence in ireland and allow us to increase the existing flow of inward foreign direct investment .
ratification would also give us guaranteed access to funding from the european stability mechanism ( esm ) , should we ever need it .
the esm is ireland ’s insurance policy as we work our way out of the bailout program with the “ troika ” ( the european commission , the ecb , and the international monetary fund ) and return to the markets .
most importantly , the fiscal treaty promises to ensure responsible budgeting throughout the eurozone .
in europe , legislation to protect personal data is not comprehensive , and much of the rest of the world lacks even rudimentary safeguards .
after exploring this issue with legislators in several countries over the past couple of months , it has become abundantly clear that many do not have a full grasp of the myriad issues that need to be considered .
it is a difficult subject to address , and doing so is impeded by lobbying efforts and incomplete information .
in the short term , young companies should view ethics not as a marketing gimmick , but as a core concern .
all organizations should invest in ethics officers or some sort of review process involving people who can assess all of the implications of a great-sounding idea .
the young people at shahbag are mainly urban , educated , and middle class ; hifazat derives its support mainly from the rural poor .
traditional versus modern , urban versus rural , intellectuals versus the peasantry : these divisions are the stuff of political cliché .
but , all too often , clichés become established because they are true .
the bangladeshi government ’s sympathies are closer to the shahbag protesters than to the hifazat counter-demonstrators .
but it must navigate a difficult path , because both points of view have significant public support .
the real bombshell , however , was the sudden realization of the threat posed by digital currencies to the existing monetary system – not at some later date , but right now .
cryptocurrencies have been around for over a decade , but none has been adopted widely enough to challenge the existing order .
with the potential to mobilize more than two billion monthly active users , facebook could change that .
now that the company has thrown down the gauntlet , governments should use the opportunity to advance a form of digital currency that serves the public good .
even the staunchest defenders of the current monetary system will admit that it does not work equally well for everyone .
before i became soviet leader in 1985 , relations between the cold war superpowers had hit rock bottom .
reagan and i were nonetheless able to create a reservoir of constructive spirit through constant outreach and face-to-face interaction .
what seem to be lacking today are leaders with the boldness and vision to build the trust needed to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of a peaceful global order .
economic constraints and the chernobyl disaster helped spur us to action .
why has the great recession and the disastrous meltdown at fukushima daiichi in japan not elicited a similar response today ?
august is the traditional month when parliaments recess for the summer .
it offers a moment to examine why they are so enfeebled .
across europe , it is not only british prime minister tony blair who is accused of " presidentialism " nowadays .
german chancellor gerhard schröder faces the same charge in the current german election campaign .
prime minister silvio berlusconi of italy , indeed , does not even like being called prime minister .
first , the new set of external disciplines come hand-in-hand with a particular , neo-liberal model of economic development that remains untested , and will foreclose development strategies that worked in the past , and others that could work in the future .
the narrowing of national autonomy in the formulation of development strategy is a cost for which developing countries are unlikely to receive an adequate reward .
second , it is doubtful that the new policy agenda will make the international financial system much safer .
as long as capital flows remain large relative to the liquid assets held by national governments and are easily reversible , the international economy will be hostage to spectacular boom and bust cycles .
indeed , by focusing attention on internal structural reforms in the developing world , the risk is that the current approach will lead to complacency on short-term capital flows , increasing rather then reducing systemic risks .
many news stories about female ceos and other high-achieving women are coded with a set of reliable clichés : they lucked into their new roles ( and thus do not deserve them ) , inherited them from male relatives or spouses ( and thus do not really hold the reins of power ) , or will not be there for long .
if all else fails , coverage concentrates so narrowly on gender that a woman ’s very leadership is weakened .
these clichés not only undermine successful women ’s reputations ; in the case of ceos , they also reduce their value to their companies .
and all of these clichés were reproduced in the coverage of barra ’s appointment at gm .
for example , cnn covered the story by referring to barra ’s “ knack for climbing the corporate ladder ” – a phrase with some suggestive undertones , and one that would never be used with a man at the top , for whom , presumably , hard work , talent , ambition , and dedication constitute more than a “ knack . ”
few observers expected china to transform suddenly into a full-fledged democracy following its accession to the world trade organization in 2001 .
but the country ’s repressive turn over the past decade has nonetheless been disappointing to witness .
state-owned enterprises are still favored , books are burned , and the communist party of china continues to assert its primacy in every domain of chinese life .
how long this will last is anyone ’s guess .
dynasties come and go , but in 2021 the cpc will mark the centenary of its founding .
more recently , elections in the post-communist countries of europe have brought groups to power whose democratic credentials are dubious , to say the least .
this is not to compare hamas to any of these political forces .
nevertheless , one must wonder about a winning movement with quite a few elected members in israeli prisons and others who are not likely to get permission to enter the country in which they were elected , so that the new parliament can not function properly .
all of this tells us three things about democracy .
first , elections rarely solve fundamental problems .
but only one such “ patriot ” was granted the honor of being allowed to perform this act .
that is why lugovoi is being asked for his autograph .
this should not , of course , be taken to mean that the patriots gushing over lugovoi ’s achievement concede the justice of the british allegations .
the social awareness of homo putinicus , meticulously burnished by television propagandists , is such that pride in lugovoi ’s achievement and indignation at the infamous campaign unleashed against him by those who hate russia can jangle within the breast of ordinary russians without the slightest dissonance .
we are evidently facing the mystery of russian thought that has proved so unfathomable to others , so unyielding to every analytical scalpel , and about which our slavophiles and eurasians wrote at length .
and , because inequality of opportunity reduces social mobility from one generation to the next , it creates persistent inequality traps .
· to remove barriers to opportunity , governments must address the root causes of inequality by identifying and eliminating discriminatory laws , not least those that actually criminalize disadvantage .
moreover , given that inequality largely begins in childhood , governments must invest far more in high-quality universal health care and early childhood education .
only by supporting the creation of human capital from an early age can we ensure that inequalities in one generation are n’t passed on to the next .
· such investments will require additional domestic resources .
some , it should be pointed out , are being made .
spain ’s labor costs have declined substantially since the crisis began .
italy has grasped crucially important reforms in areas like pensions .
greece has cut spending by a larger amount , relative to gdp , than any country in europe since world war ii .
other reforms – especially political reforms – will be hotly contested .
two bubbles – property and credit – against which american families borrowed freely , have long since burst .
but the aftershocks linger : household-debt loads were still at 113 % of disposable personal income in 2012 ( versus 75 % in the final three decades of the twentieth century ) , and the personal-saving rate averaged just 3.9 % last year ( compared to 7.9 % from 1970 to 1999 ) .
understandably fixated on balance-sheet repair , us consumers have not taken the bait from their monetary and fiscal authorities .
instead , they have cut back on spending .
gains in inflation-adjusted personal-consumption expenditure have averaged a mere 0.8 % over the past five years – the most severe and protracted slowdown in consumer demand growth in the post-world war ii era .
although his motivation , at least in part , may have been a desire for social justice , perón was , in effect , bribing the beneficiaries to support his own rise to power and wealth .
with his beautiful and outspoken wife – a “ woman of the people ” – at his side , perón was able to persuade voters in 1946 that , as president , he would fundamentally change the country .
he was as good as his word .
perón ’s government nationalized banks and railroads , increased the minimum wage and improved living standards , reduced the national debt ( for a while at least ) , and revived the economy .
argentina became less reliant on foreign trade , though the move toward autarky eventually undermined growth , causing the country to lose its position among the world ’s richest .
eventually , amid street riots and political mayhem , argentina abandoned the currency peg in 2002 .
viewed with argentina ’s experience in mind , brazil ’s spending cap looks problematic – all the more so against a backdrop of political turmoil that is set to continue for the foreseeable future .
the cap will likely become even more politically controversial once brazil recovers , as it will .
it is not hard to imagine the next administration – whenever it comes about – perceiving the cap as an obstacle to faster economic growth .
the cap ’s defenders will sound unconvincing , because the economic case for it is weak in the absence of extreme credibility problems .
part of this can be explained by misunderstandings about the relationship between stock market prices and economic growth .
a strange conventional wisdom developed in the inflationary 1970s and 1980s : that strong economic growth and falling unemployment was bad for share prices .
prosperity , it was felt , would incite inflation , provoke high interest rates , triggering a stock market rout .
while experts spent the last two years propounding this thesis the market quietly restored an older , more common-sense rule : prosperity is good for profits and therefore good for shares .
here is one message from the markets worth pondering , even for non-investors : political confidence may be at a low ebb in europe ; businesses and consumers may be shell-shocked by the last recession and gloomy about the future ; but judging by the market 's behavior the years ahead are more likely to resemble the stable and prosperous 1950s and 1960s than the crisis-ridden decades from 1973 to 1989 .
elsewhere , the nigerian association of chambers of commerce , industry , mines , and agriculture ( naccima ) used its agenda over several years to coordinate economic reform .
in 1999 , this task assumed critical importance due to the country 's opening to democracy .
a legislative advisory program is another tool business can use to influence public policy .
to shape legislation such programs require :
* sound economic analysis , and background papers readily available for technocrats and others to study ;
the currencies collapsed , and the banking sectors collapsed .
the imf predicted that thailand and the others would achieve positive growth in 1998 ( 3 percent in the case of thailand , for example ) .
now , the imf acknowledges that thailand will shrink by around 3 percent .
its medicine did little to save the economy .
the imf mobilized massive amounts of money ( $ 118 billion in all ) for indonesia , korea , and thailand , so that they would pay back the foreign creditors trying to withdraw their funds .
the obama administration knows the iron law of american politics – “ it ’s the economy , stupid ” – as well as anyone else .
nevertheless , highlighting obama ’s ability to get things done abroad is more than an attempt at distraction ; it also sends the message that the domestic-policy impasse is not his fault .
so expect plenty of foreign-policy news in the coming months .
election-year tactics aside , american voters are right .
obama has performed much better in foreign policy than in domestic policy , which is all the more surprising given the weak hand that he was dealt : an america that had lost its moral authority , its military invincibility , and its credibility as an economic model .
but it is just one aspect of europe ’s urgent need to import people from africa and asia .
europeans will also see the dismantling of their welfare states and social security systems ; the cherished “ european model ” of pensions , healthcare , and unemployment benefits risks being replaced by the despised and widely feared “ american model . ”
this is not , needless to say , because europeans crave the rigors of america ’s less cosseted social conditions , but because it ’s the only way that european governments will be able to stay afloat financially .
the root cause of all these developments is europe ’s population shrinkage .
the “ demographic time bomb ” that economic analysts have been discussing for a decade or more is now exploding .
they feel confirmed in their belief that , for most western governments , outrage over iran ’s terrorist activities counts less than the lure of business .
and they watch with glee at how europe , japan , and america , instead of acting together , display the weakness of disunity .
should a rogue state be allowed to get away with its provocations ?
the trouble is : in most cases it will .
the instruments of coercion that states dispose of short of military intervention are imperfect and , to be remotely efficient , require a degree of international solidarity that is only generated in exceptional circumstances .
london – a flawed understanding of what drives economic growth has emerged as the gravest threat to recovery in europe .
european policymakers are obsessed with national “ competitiveness , ” and genuinely appear to think that prosperity is synonymous with trade surpluses .
this largely explains why germany is routinely cited as an example of a strong , “ competitive ” economy .
but economic growth , even in traditionally export-led economies , is driven by productivity growth , not by the ability to capture a growing share of global markets .
while imports must , of course , be financed by exports , the focus on trade competitiveness is drawing attention away from europe ’s underlying problem – very weak productivity growth .
and the more important battery cells are to the overall value of electric cars , the stronger the agglomeration effect will be .
this would be a momentous shift .
china currently controls the entire value chain of electric cars , including the supply of cobalt , an essential raw material in battery manufacturing .
as a result , china produces 69 % of the world ’s electric-car battery cells , the united states 15 % ( at tesla ’s “ gigafactory ” in nevada ) , and europe just 4 % .
nonetheless , europe could still develop battery production by recycling old electronics , developing new cobalt-saving processes , and discovering alternative mineral deposits .
governments need to reduce bureaucratic red tape so that entrepreneurs can take more risks .
but breakthrough technology companies such as apple , facebook , and twitter also depend on people who had access to well-funded education systems .
and while there is a growing “ tech for good ” sector in europe , it will succeed only if it is supported by up-to-date infrastructure , which generally requires public outlays .
policymakers in europe ( and elsewhere ) need to adjust their thinking – especially their fiscal thinking – to put people first .
governments that make it their central objective to maximize human wellbeing end up not only encouraging higher economic growth , but also nurturing healthier politics .
the initiative will have to come from the top if the case is to be made within each country for more open markets , and for help to be made available to those facing adjustment .
all countries will have to give ; no country can be expected to carry the burden alone .
pro-trade forces can speak up in the political process .
for example , it is untenable in rich countries that farm interests accounting for less than 4 % of employment are effectively able to block a deal to open new markets for services and manufactures , which account for more than 90 % of employment .
in developing countries , pro-trade voices could help turn the debate toward the opportunities of global integration rather than emphasizing exceptions .
indeed , iran ’s prompt support for iraq ’s shia-led government was partly intended to preempt competition from regional adversaries .
but iranian critics of intervention seem to believe that there is a middle way .
inter-sectarian dialogue in iraq and a regional compromise with turkey and the gulf states does not necessarily translate into a loss of iranian influence .
iran has already countenanced the removal of maliki in favor of haider al-abadi , and if a broader reconsideration of policy is needed to quell the is threat , so be it .
iran ’s hawks might believe that their country is invincible , but fears are growing that regional overreach could trigger a long list of dangerous consequences .
in houston , authorities were ready for harvey in part because of lessons learned from hurricane katrina , which devastated new orleans in 2005 .
that storm caused 1,833 deaths , while at least 88 were killed during harvey .
the impact of lessons learned in india is even more striking .
in october 2013 , residents of odisha state were alerted early to the arrival of cyclone phailin .
by the time the storm made landfall , many people had already evacuated .
for catalan separatists , this means they now face what the political scientist hans morgenthau termed the “ a-b-c paradox ” of nationalism .
if catalonia wants to leave spain , why should n’t barcelona have the right to leave catalonia ?
and why would n’t today ’s “ oppressed ” catalans become tomorrow ’s oppressors to prevent that from happening ?
given that the status quo is unstable , and independence impossible , many believe that the only solution is more fiscal autonomy for catalonia .
but this , too , is unlikely in the near term .
even that futile scenario might be optimistic , as it assumes that talks get off the ground – an impossible feat , if israel continues its illegal construction of settlements in the occupied palestinian territories .
such activities are not just unjust ; they are a violation of united nations security council resolution 2334 , adopted nearly unanimously last year ( the us , then led by barack obama , abstained ) .
that resolution demanded “ that israel immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied palestinian territory , including east jerusalem ” – activities that amount to a “ flagrant violation under international law . ”
any agreement between israelis and palestinians will require deep concessions by both sides – concessions that leaders on both sides will need to convince their respective publics to accept .
trump ’s son-in-law and adviser , jared kushner , who has been tasked with settling the conflict , and the trump administration ’s chief negotiator on the issue , jason greenblatt , seem to understand this .
the chinese authorities are well aware of how much their country has benefited from becoming deeply integrated into the global economy .
and they are not prepared to risk the basis of their domestic legitimacy : economic growth .
the belt and road initiative ( bri , formerly called one belt , one road ) – which xi has baptized “ the project of the century ” – is a true reflection of china ’s strategic choice to strengthen commercial links with the rest of eurasia and africa , taking advantage of the opportunity to accumulate “ soft power . ”
in doing so , however , china is not openly calling into question the foundations of the liberal order .
the remarkable communiqué from world leaders participating in the bri forum in beijing last month committed more than 30 countries and international organizations to the promotion of “ peace , justice , social cohesion , inclusiveness , democracy , good governance , the rule of law , human rights , gender equality , ” and the empowerment of women .
the question , then , is whether the new leaders , as early as next month , succeed in a new effort to adopt the vital institutional reforms that the enlarged union requires .
the best way to proceed is to focus on the essentials .
part iii of the blocked constitutional treaty is merely a compendium of the existing eu treaties , which – because these treaties will remain in force regardless of whether they are part of the new document – can be decoupled from the rest .
part ii of the stalled document , the charter of fundamental rights , can be postponed .
to be sure , this would be painful because , as the eu bureaucracies gain more authority , the eu ’s democratic deficit will widen without clearly defined fundamental rights .
this is true of the nations of europe .
but for europe , there is a more profound reason : the transatlantic alliance is needed today more than ever , and it is much stronger with britain in europe and europe an equal partner with america .
forget the short-term electoral politics there or here .
in the long term , this is essentially an alliance of values : liberty , democracy , and the rule of law .
as the world changes and opens up across boundaries of nation and culture , which values will govern the twenty-first century ?
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
similarly , a few months ago , two police vice ministers , a minister of transportation , and a former head of the state petroleum corporation were all brought to court on charges of selling state property to private companies at a loss .
taken together , these cases point to a high level of state capture – a form of corruption , rife in former soviet-bloc countries , in which powerful private actors use insiders to gain control of public institutions and assets .
a minority coalition that included the greens would force the csu to compromise on migration issues and climate policy , which would be unnecessary otherwise , given the inability of the spd , die linke ( the left ) , and the greens to block legislation .
and merkel herself will try to avoid a minority coalition with the fdp , in order to avoid becoming dependent on it .
the fdp , for its part , would like to participate in such a government for exactly that reason .
it would then be able to contain merkel ’s red-green affinity .
a minority government , whatever its composition , would not necessarily be a bad thing .
one government minister at the cdf noted that the one million chinese tourists who went abroad last year used their credit cards to buy about $ 1 billion worth of goods that they can not obtain at home ( while noting the irony that some of those european and american branded goods are actually manufactured in china ) .
china is still a low-income country , with per capita gdp of just $ 14,000 , about one fourth of that in the united states .
although beijing and shanghai are relatively prosperous , there is still much poverty .
it is revealing that to achieve the five-year plan ’s goal of eliminating poverty by 2020 , which requires reducing the number of poor people by 55 million , the poverty line is defined as just $ 354 a year , or less than one dollar a day .
chinese corporations ’ high level of debt could be a source of financial instability , although several officials stressed that they were not worried .
but those who believe that the ccp can defy both the internal degenerative dynamics of autocracy and the historical record of failed one-party regimes might benefit from reading leon trotsky , who knew something about revolutions .
dictatorships are regarded as indestructible before they fall , trotsky reminds us , but their demise is viewed as inevitable once they are toppled .
another explanation is fear of contemplating the unknown .
ccp rule may not last , but the alternative – state failure and civil chaos – could be far worse than the status quo .
but the record of democratic transitions since 1974 suggests that regime change in china is unlikely to be calamitous .
neusoft began as a low-cost competitor to the oracle corporation .
after moving on to produce car audio equipment , liu jiren , neusoft 's ceo , began hearing complaints from local hospitals about the high cost of specialized x-ray , mri , ultrasound , and ct-scanning machines ( such as those made by ge , philips , siemens , and toshiba ) .
suddenly , a new business was born .
liu realized that neusoft could link standard intel chips and its own imaging software to a range of digital sensors .
neusoft 's equipment looks like little personal computers with sensors attached .
princeton – by now , everyone knows that germany is calling the shots not just in the eurozone , but across all of europe .
inside germany , there used be endless debates about german identity – what one historian called “ the continual dispute about what being german might mean . ”
but , in foreign-policy terms , post-war west germany – and , later , reunified germany – was utterly predictable : never against the west ; always for more europe .
now , the “ berlin republic ” is very secure about its identity – and seemingly at sea in its dealings with the world .
there are structural reasons for this change .
and the oversight that warped kelvin ’s estimate – the possibility that fluid motion could efficiently transport heat within the earth ’s interior – turned out to be critical to understanding plate tectonics and continental drift .
startup companies exemplify the potential benefits of risk-taking .
while only about 49 % of manufacturing startups and 37 % of information startups survive for four or more years , those that do have managed to produce breakthrough innovations .
tom watson , jr. , who led ibm through decades of strong growth , is known for having supported brilliant blunders .
as he put it , “ we should have the courage to take risks when they are thoughtful risks … . we must forgive mistakes which have been made because someone was trying to act aggressively in the company ’s interest . ”
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
the biggest threat comes from netanyahu .
according to putin , he rooted for trump ( but of course did not interfere on trump ’s behalf ) because they shared a desire to improve bilateral relations .
now , more than ever , putin needs america ’s friendship .
though he was reelected president in a landslide in march , his approval rating has since plummeted to 45 % .
russians resent the mounting economic insecurity brought about by the sanctions trump ’s predecessor , barack obama , initiated after russia ’s annexation of crimea in 2014 ( a move that initially bolstered putin ’s flagging approval ratings ) .
popular discontent in russia has also been inflamed by the authorities ’ widely reviled pension reform , which includes an increase in the retirement age .
of course , wall street ( whose interests the us treasury represents ) profits from capital market liberalization : they make money as capital flows in , as it flows out , and in the restructuring that occurs in the resulting havoc .
in south korea , the imf urged the sale of the country ’s banks to american investors , even though koreans had managed their own economy impressively for four decades , with higher growth , more stability , and without the systemic scandals that have marked us financial markets with such frequency .
in some cases , us firms bought the banks , held on to them until korea recovered , and then resold them , reaping billions in capital gains .
in its rush to have westerners buy the banks , the imf forgot one detail : to ensure that south korea could recapture at least a fraction of those gains through taxation .
whether us investors had greater expertise in banking in emerging markets may be debatable ; that they had greater expertise in tax avoidance is not .
princeton – on january 1 , derek parfit , one of the greatest philosophers of my generation , died .
just a year earlier , in a poll on a leading philosophy website , parfit had been voted the most important living anglophone philosopher .
of all the philosophers i have known since i began to study the subject more than 50 years ago , parfit was the closest to a genius .
getting into a philosophical argument with him was like playing chess with a grandmaster : he had already thought of every response i could make to his arguments , considered several possible replies , and knew the objections to each reply as well as the best counters to those objections .
parfit was not a household name .
on paper , the hospital appears well staffed and adequately equipped , but on my rounds there , i found the halls and wards deserted and barren .
few therapeutic and diagnostic options were available .
even a basic test like a cat scan would require transport to another regional hospital .
but under-equipped hospitals may not be the greatest obstacle to controlling china 's aids crisis .
equally harmful are the government ’s sensitivity to its own policy failures and the stigma attached to a disease that is often sexually transmitted .
comparing the outcomes of these two simulations suggests that large export flows of palestinian labor to israel reduce the capacity of the palestinian economy to export goods by putting upward pressure on wages , undermining competitiveness .
these simulations also suggested that continued reliance on the export of labor results in a lower growth potential for the palestinian economy than does a development strategy based on exporting goods .
but the level of average incomes in the west bank and gaza will remain much lower under the latter strategy than in the situation where the israeli labor market is gradually reopened for palestinian labor .
this confirms the huge short term welfare cost to palestinian society of restricting palestinian workers ' access to the israeli labor market .
what trade policies might boost exports of goods rather than labor ?
addis ababa – when zimbabwe ’s president robert mugabe was deposed in november 2017 , after 30 years in power , many hoped that the economic decline he had overseen would soon be reversed .
but , a year and a half later , the economy is showing no signs of recovering , thanks to an ongoing currency crisis .
could a blockchain-based cryptocurrency be the cure for what ails zimbabwe ?
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
but , in this case , when the son borrows essential elements of his father ’s architectural principles and serves a regime that seeks to use the games for some of the same reasons that animated hitler , is he not willingly reflecting those sins ?
totalitarian regimes – the nazis , the soviets in 1980 , and now the chinese – desire to host the olympics as a way to signal to the world their superiority .
china believes that it has found its own model to develop and modernize , and its rulers regard the games in the same way as the nazis and leonid brezhnev did , as a means of “ selling ” their model to a global audience .
obviously , the chinese were politically tone-deaf in choosing an architect whose name carried such dark historical connotations .
the name of speer itself probably did not matter to the officials who chose him .
the way to square this apparent circle is by noting that we love our motherland not because of a misplaced sense of ethnic or racial superiority , but because it stands for noble and universal values .
macron can proudly call himself a french patriot because france gave the world liberté , égalité , and fraternité .
in the recent dutch election , liberals could argue for respecting the rights of immigrants because respect and tolerance are traditional dutch values , of which any dutch patriot can be proud .
these are examples of what the philosopher jürgen habermas has called constitutional patriotism ( others have called it civic patriotism ) .
this philosophical position has practical implications .
carrying out such investigations effectively and without delay would restore the icc ’s credibility and bolster its ability to fulfill its intended role as a powerful force for international justice .
to succeed , the icc will need to overcome strong resistance , not only from dictators and warlords , but even from elected leaders , especially us president donald trump .
in april , when the icc was determining whether to proceed with its inquiry into war crimes in afghanistan – including any that may have been perpetrated by american forces – the trump administration revoked the visa of the court ’s chief prosecutor .
if the icc is to fulfill the role for which it was created , it can neither bow to such pressure , nor allow its deficient performance to continue .
instead , its leaders – especially its chief prosecutor , the gambian attorney fatou bensouda – must take recent criticism as motivation , and prove that they are up to the task .
new york – capital-account regulations have been at the center of global financial debates for two years .
the reasons are clear : since the world has experienced a “ multi-speed recovery , ” as the international monetary fund puts it , slow-growth advanced countries are maintaining very low interest rates and other expansionary monetary policies , while fast-growth emerging economies are unwinding the expansionary policies that they adopted during the recession .
this asymmetry has spurred huge capital flows from the former to the latter , which are likely to continue .
emerging economies fear that this flood of capital will drive up their currencies ’ exchange rates , in addition to fueling current-account deficits and asset bubbles , which past experience has taught them is a sure recipe for future crises .
the problem is compounded by the fact that one of the countries undertaking expansionary policies is the united states , which has the world ’s largest financial sector and issues the paramount global currency .
greenpeace , along with other organizations opposed to the use of genetically modified organisms ( gmos ) , has campaigned against the introduction of beta carotene , which is converted in the human body into vitamin a.
moore ’s mortality figures seem to be on the high side , but there is no doubting the seriousness of vitamin a deficiency among children , especially in parts of africa and southeast asia .
according to the world health organization , it causes blindness in about 250,000-500,000 pre-school children every year , about half of whom die within 12 months .
the deficiency also increases susceptibility to diseases like measles , still a significant cause of death in young children , although one that is declining as a result of vaccination .
in some countries , lack of vitamin a is also a major factor in high rates of maternal mortality during pregnancy and childbirth .
so what lessons does history have to teach us about our current global economic predicament ?
in 1829 , john stuart mill made the key intellectual leap in figuring out how to fight what he called “ general gluts . ”
mill saw that excess demand for some particular set of assets in financial markets was mirrored by excess supply of goods and services in product markets , which in turn generated excess supply of workers in labor markets .
the implication of this was clear .
if you relieved the excess demand for financial assets , you also cured the excess supply of goods and services ( the shortfall of aggregate demand ) and the excess supply of labor ( mass unemployment ) .
no single actor – be it a government , a university research laboratory , an ngo , an entrepreneur , or a group of investors – can solve today ’s really big problems alone .
it is a gap seen in areas as diverse as health care , education , and the fight against climate change .
that is why the chan zuckerberg initiative was designed for maximum flexibility , allowing funds to be channeled into non-profits , directed into private investments , or used to help influence policy debates .
similarly , the bec has pledged to boost the work of others by taking “ a flexible approach to early stage , providing seed , angel and series a investments , with the expectation that once these investments are de-risked , traditional commercial capital will invest in the later stages . ”
of course , not even billionaires can solve the world ’s problems on their own .
us populists , perhaps inspired by the writings of thomas piketty , seem unimpressed by the fact that globalization has lifted hundreds of millions of desperately poor people in china and india into the global middle class .
the liberal view of asia ’s rise is that it makes the world a fairer and more just place , where a person ’s economic fate does not depend quite so much on where they happen to have been born .
but a more cynical view permeates populist logic , namely that in its excessive adherence to globalism , the us has sown the seeds of its own political and economic destruction .
trumpism taps into this sense of national mortality ; here is someone who thinks he can do something about it .
the aim is not just to “ bring home ” american jobs , but to create a system that will extend us dominance .
one approach would enhance deterrence by bolstering conventional south korean and us forces and reintroducing tactical nuclear weapons in the south .
but more conventional power would add little to the capable forces already on the ground , and bringing nuclear weapons back to south korea would only make both sides more anxious ( and offshore us naval nuclear forces already pack a sufficient punch to reinforce deterrence ) .
another approach would seek to normalize diplomatic relations , on the assumption that this could enhance communication , thereby diminishing the nuclear threat .
but , in such a scenario , north korea could hold relations hostage to such outsize demands as withdrawal of us forces from the region and economic and energy assistance to prop up the regime .
ultimately , north korea ’s stalinist government will rebuff any effort that encroaches on the isolation that it needs to remain in power .
so the populist backlash in latin america – in brazil , bolivia , ecuador , and , most disastrously , venezuela – took a left-wing form .
the story is similar in the main two exceptions to right-wing resurgence in europe – greece and spain .
in greece , the main political fault line has been austerity policies imposed by european institutions and the international monetary fund .
in spain , most immigrants until recently came from culturally similar latin american countries .
in both countries , the far right lacked the breeding ground it had elsewhere .
british and american negotiators secretly met with libyan counterparts to resolve the case of the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie , scotland , and other terrorism issues .
in the quid pro quo that followed , qaddafi agreed to eliminate his nascent nuclear program in exchange for an end to pariah status .
this was coupled with a critical demand : no deal without america ’s commitment to eschew regime change .
on december 19 , 2003 , libya formally renounced all wmd efforts .
eight years later , pinned down by a us predator drone and french airstrikes , qaddafi met his demise .
botswana 's incredible annual per capita income growth of approximately 13 % in the last decade was accompanied by a decrease from nearly six children per woman to less than four .
why is rapid population growth bad for a country 's standard of living ?
the math is simple : more people means that ( on average ) everyone gets less .
a growing population dilutes not only the accumulation of physical capital , but also human capital .
the quality of children in poor households goes down as their quantity goes up , because poor families with many children are unable to invest enough in the education of each child to ensure that future adults benefit from a key determinant of economic success .
like it or not , they can not do that as a brigade of flower children ; they need to pick leaders who can speak for them and negotiate for them .
the modernizers need to form a coherent force – and most likely a political party – rather than simply relying on the wisdom ( and good behavior ) of the crowd to govern the country .
that does not mean that activists should abandon the cause for which they are fighting .
but it does mean understanding that even democracy has many rules – ideally rules that a majority has chosen . but they are mostly not chosen directly ; those rules generally reflect compromises among elected representatives who can argue and negotiate in person , reflecting the overall preferences of those who elected them .
that may sound a little too much like the old system , but it does n’t have to be .
rising incomes ; the growing demand for health care , childcare , and elder care in aging societies ; and investments in infrastructure , energy , and technology will create new job opportunities .
given the sectoral and occupational distribution of these opportunities , women may be slightly better placed to take advantage of them .
assuming that current gender occupational and sectoral patterns hold , women could have access to 20 % more jobs than they do today , compared to 19 % for men .
this slight advantage for women reflects the robust growth that is expected in sectors like health care , where women are well represented .
in fact , in many countries , women account for over 70 % of health-care and social-assistance workers , and this sector could comprise one-quarter of future job opportunities for women ( manufacturing will account for a similar share of potential job gains for men ) .
i myself once witnessed putin courting culture .
it was new year ’s eve 2003 , during a concert at the newly opened house of music in moscow .
directly across the aisle from me , there was putin , sitting between the one-time dissident cellist and conductor mstislav rostropovich and his equally famous wife , opera diva galina vishnevskaya .
russia ’s leader was like a kid in a candy store – thrilled to be surrounded by these cultural icons , former exiles no less .
and the icons were obviously flattered by putin ’s adoration ( and by their proximity to power ) .
but gdp growth soon began deteriorating rapidly .
in an effort to revive growth in a difficult global environment and buffer exports against the impact of the asian financial crisis , the chinese government loosened monetary and fiscal policy beginning in november 1997 .
but it was too little too late .
by 1998 , when cpi inflation began to fall , producer prices had already been declining for eight months , and remained negative for a total of 51 months , with cpi growth beginning to recover after 39 months .
an obvious lesson is that the government should have switched to loosening earlier , and more forcefully .
so have we now moved from piketty ’s r > g world to blanchard ’s r < g world ?
if so , can their views be reconciled ?
the answer is no and yes .
the views of piketty and blanchard can indeed be reconciled , because they are talking about different interest rates .
while blanchard focuses on the rate on low-risk government bonds , piketty is concerned with the return on risky capital investments .
banks have not failed , and there is no sign of tumbling dominoes .
but that is not because banks prepared themselves by raising more capital .
on the contrary , compared to their likely future losses , european banks have raised relatively little capital recently – and much of this has been creative accounting , rather than truly loss-absorbing shareholder equity .
perhaps the risk that a greek debt restructuring would cause a financial meltdown was always minimal , and quiescent markets were to be expected .
but , in that case , why all the fuss ?
in the scandinavian countries , as opposed to , say , germany and the us , the government , not individual companies , are responsible for most social benefits .
that way , economically irrational lock-in effects , whereby workers simply can not afford to change jobs , are avoided .
furthermore , benefits are generous enough to ensure that short periods of unemployment do n’t force workers to sell their homes or even cars .
the system protects not only the unemployed , who can continue to pay their mortgages and interest , but also indirectly the banks , because their loans to households are repaid even in times of recession .
and , instead of solving all sorts of economically caused private problems , laid-off workers can concentrate on finding new and more future-oriented jobs .
the irony is that this advice comes after much of their former productive capacity has disappeared .
but , having suffered currency and capital-account crises with greater openness , many emerging-market economies still feel compelled to accumulate huge reserves to protect themselves in the face of greater global financial volatility .
while financial globalization has not enhanced growth , it has exacerbated volatility and instability .
meanwhile , national “ policy space ” for economic recovery has shrunk since the crisis .
public investment and basic social protection can help to turn this around , by creating millions of jobs .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
one aspect of this supposed moral and cultural decline concerns the family : “ to attack the institution of the family , to regard it with contempt or to doubt its important role , ” the pope and the grand imam state , “ is one of the most threatening evils of our era . ”
the document asserts that the family is the “ fundamental nucleus of society and humanity ” and “ is essential in bringing children into the world , raising them , educating them , and providing them with solid moral formation and domestic security . ”
addis ababa – with almost 60 % of its population under the age of 25 , africa is the world ’s youngest region .
yet it is widely recognized that young people are often left behind .
they frequently face inadequate economic opportunities and may also be socially or politically excluded .
unless youth socioeconomic and political engagement is addressed , achieving many of the united nations sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) will be impossible .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
in the nineteenth century , no country took more land from china than russia did , and the current demographic situation in the far east – where russians number six million , and the population on the chinese side of the border is up to 120 million – is a source of anxiety in moscow .
russia ’s economic decline has increased its concern about the rise of china .
while trade has increased , investment lags , and russia ranks only tenth among china ’s export markets .
as the economist recently reported , russia worries about becoming the alliance ’s junior partner – more dependent on china than china is on russia .
according to feng yujun of fudan university , “ the most important relationship for us is the one with america .
florence – in phaedrus ’s well-known fable of the wolf and the lamb , the wolf easily could have eaten the lamb without a word , but prefers to set out his “ reasons . ”
first , he scolds the lamb because he is muddying his drinking water ( even though the wolf was upstream ) .
then he argues that last year the lamb had called him bad names ( but the lamb was only six months old ) .
the wolf then snarls that if it was not the lamb , it was his father ; after that , he immediately moves into action .
the wolf ’s “ justifications ” for his evil action were a luxury that he allowed himself .
arlington , virginia – the election left one of the world ’s largest countries deeply divided , handing the presidency to a military-loving , minority-bullying , media-bashing firebrand promising to smash a corrupt establishment .
i am not talking about the 2016 us presidential election that put donald trump in power , but rather the 2018 election in brazil , won by the so-called trump of the tropics , jair bolsonaro , who was formally inaugurated on january 1 .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
she then quickly proceeded to give a long celebratory speech about the heroism of us soldiers “ fighting for freedom ” abroad .
it seemed an odd – and to many offensive – transition : from king ’s great plea for civil rights to palin ’s sentimental clichés about the military .
but then there was something odd about the entire event , just as there is something odd about the tea party movement itself .
this latest surge of american populism is financed by some extremely wealthy men , including a couple of oil billionaires named david and charles koch , who favor cutting taxes for the super-rich and abolishing government subsidies for the poor , such as social security and president barack obama ’s health-care plan .
this agenda might seem selfish , though understandable from the point of view of an oil billionaire .
the start of his papacy finds the populist governments in a vulnerable situation , hit hard by chávez ’s recent death .
they all , of course , have their own identities and strengths , but they will miss the protection of chávez ’s global influence , as well as his subsidies .
moreover , they rule countries in which catholics are an overwhelming majority .
although the degree of their religious commitment varies , they share a strong emotional attachment to the faith , which will provide francis i with considerable political leverage .
latin america will no doubt be one of francis ’s priorities .
we must lead the world , by deed and by example . ”
but obama can not do it alone – and , so far , neither the american public nor the us congress seems committed to reconnecting with its moral compass .
it should be unacceptable , for example , for congress to block the release of 86 guantánamo bay detainees cleared by a committee of national-security officials .
not even the revelations by former intelligence contractor edward snowden that no one is exempt from the possibility of us surveillance have stirred americans to demand a new approach .
the answer to the second major question shaping the world ’s future – whether china will regain its economic momentum – also appears to be “ no , ” at least in the short term , with most experts agreeing that china ’s export - and investment-led growth model has all but exhausted its potential .
nevertheless , substantive and remarkable progress has been made , all in the last few years .
moreover , someday we will know – via sequencing of the whole genome – about rarer genomic variations that are correlated with treatment response or side-effects .
this has paved the way for next-generation pharmacies .
genotyping can now be accomplished in 20 minutes , and over time will get even faster .
to fill a prescription for a drug with a known pharmacogenomic profile , a customer can get rapid genotyping to determine appropriate dose , drug , or predilection for serious side-effects .
the financial crisis has produced a new answer to where the greatest competitive advantages lie .
from banks ’ perspective , the most obvious lesson was the need for a strong national government to bear the potential costs of a rescue .
it is no longer best to be subject to the most favorable regulatory regime , but to be where the state has the deepest pockets .
very large banks in small territories with small-scale governments are vulnerable .
the us is big enough to handle behemoths like bank of america or citigroup .
we have yet to do comparable analyses on the fate of caribbean and indian ocean islands following first human contact , but it is likely that large numbers of extinctions occurred there , too .
early european exploration likely continued this rapid pace of extinction .
the number of species known to have expired between 1500 and 1800 is increasing as taxonomists describe new species from skeletal remains they find in caves , for example , where bones survive .
these searches are far from complete .
linneaus invented the modern process of naming species in the mid-1700 ’s , although naming did not get under way until the peace following napoleon bonaparte ’s defeat in 1815 .
syria , iraq , yemen , and libya are all dealing with a mix of civil and proxy wars .
the iran nuclear pact at best manages one aspect of iranian power , and only for a limited duration .
the islamic state ( isis ) may lose its territorial dimension ; but it , along with other groups , will continue to pose a terrorist threat for years to come .
the plight of millions of refugees constitutes not just a humanitarian tragedy , but also an economic and strategic burden to countries in the region and in europe .
and europe is already confronting many significant challenges , including russian aggression against ukraine , brexit , the rise of populism and nationalism , and low rates of economic growth .
these movements have created the space for forward-thinking politicians to take action .
nevertheless , the climate crisis continues to grow , demonstrating that we still have a long way to go .
this year alone , catastrophicheat waves have stricken north africa , europe , japan , pakistan , australia , and argentina .
deadly wildfires have taken lives and destroyed billions of dollars worth of property in greece , sweden , the united states , and russia .
droughts have struck in kenya and somalia ; and afghanistan and south africa have suffered major water shortages .
this is the beginning of an important dialogue .
the stakes for both africa and the us are high .
a strong , prosperous africa with a productive and expanding middle class is in america ’s interest , and a strong partnership with the us will be vital for africa ’s continued growth and development .
the decisions we make now will have implications for generations to come .
we owe it to our descendants – and to the silicon savannah entrepreneurs already leading the charge – to get it right .
paris – some countries are naturally at ease with the concept and the reality of strategic power .
such was clearly the case of france under louis xiv , the sun king in the seventeenth century , and such is the case today of china , whose leadership is comfortable with the balance-of-power games of classical europe .
india is clearly in a different category .
in economic terms , india ’s confidence has been boosted by the way the western world now looks at it with a mixture of respect and greed : “ what kind of deals can i strike with such an emerging market , whose population will soon be the largest of any country in the world ? ”
yet , in order to understand india ’s political and diplomatic relationship with the outside world , the most enlightening comparison is with america in 1920 .
views about social mobility are not uniform across the political spectrum or across geographic regions .
in both the us and europe , for example , people who call themselves “ conservative ” on matters of economic policy believe that there are equal opportunities for all children , and that the free-market economy in their country is fair .
the opposite holds true for those who call themselves economically “ liberal . ”
these people favor government intervention , because they believe that , left to their own devices , markets will not ensure fairness , and may even generate more inequality .
an even more striking pattern is that americans are overly optimistic about social mobility in parts of the country where actual mobility is low – including the southeastern states of georgia , alabama , virginia , north carolina , and south carolina .
the grocer , coffee shop , and barber go out of business , and everybody leaves , turning the place into a ghost town .
the disruption can be caused not only by an industrial closure .
once upon a time , there were many relatively small department-store chains and other retailers with headquarters spread throughout the us and outlets in a few towns .
these headquarters brought income into their town by providing back-office services to their network of stores .
but consolidation in the retail industry , driven in part by walmart and amazon , dealt a deathblow to many of these companies .
the bat does not have enough support even among republicans , and it would violate world trade organization rules .
the republicans ’ proposed tax cuts would create a $ 2 trillion revenue shortfall over the next decade , and they can not plug that hole with revenue savings from their health-care reform plan or with the $ 1.2 trillion that could have been expected from a bat .
the republicans must now choose between passing their tax cuts ( and adding $ 2 trillion to the public debt ) and pursuing a much more modest reform .
the first scenario is unlikely for three reasons .
first , fiscally conservative congressional republicans will object to a reckless increase in the public debt .
such resilience will be tested over the longer run , though , owing to the fiscal and external imbalances , which were unaffected by the data revision .
part of the analytical attractiveness of the national income accounts is that they add up .
if a country saves more but investment remains unchanged , then it borrows less from ( or lends more to ) the rest of the world .
its net export position and current-account balance improves .
but that did not happen in this case .
first , when it comes to climate change , the important thing is to look like you are doing something .
countries that manage that can get away with massaging the data .
the 2015 paris climate agreement is a great example of this .
countries made a grandiose commitment to keep the global increase in temperature well below 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels , but all their promises together add up to less than 1 % of what ’s needed .
new analysis shows that only 17 countries – including algeria and samoa – are actually meeting their commitments , in most cases because they promised very little .
thawing siberian permafrost will release vast quantities of methane .
as a result , vast areas of our planet , currently home to billions of people , could become uninhabitable .
earlier conferences of the unfccc signatories sought to reach legally binding agreements on emission reductions , at least for the industrialized countries that have produced most of the greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere .
that strategy faltered – partly owing to us intransigence under president george w. bush – and was abandoned when the 2009 copenhagen conference failed to produce a treaty to replace the expiring kyoto protocol ( which the us never signed ) .
instead , the copenhagen accord merely asked countries for voluntary pledges to cut their emissions by specific amounts .
along the same lines , during russian prime minister dmitri medvedev ’s presidency , he called for the creation of a mechanism for european preventive diplomacy and mandatory consultations in the event of a threat to any state ’s security .
had such a mechanism been established , the worst events in ukraine could have been averted .
political leaders are , of course , to blame for filing away these and other “ european ideas ” in the archives .
but the blame must also be shared with the entire european political class , civil-society institutions , and the media .
though i am , by nature , an optimist , i have to admit that it is very difficult not to be pessimistic as 2014 comes to a close .
when it comes to solutions , europe is ahead of the curve .
for example , my home country , denmark , which has been asked to lead talks on energy at the un summit , has integrated vast quantities of wind power into its electricity grid .
sweden , which will run an industry workstream with india , has created the world ’s first fossil-fuel-free steel plant .
and progress is hardly limited to northern europe : romania boasts europe ’s largest onshore wind farm ; poland is producing electric buses ; and austria is leading when it comes to green buildings .
but , as european leaders increasingly recognize , it is time to hit the accelerator .
tolerance for other people ’s religion is the price paid for tolerance of one ’s own .
prejudice has tended to fall as participation increases .
it has been in no one ’s interest to disturb this live-and let-live pragmatism for very long .
one result of the deal is the paradoxical-sounding “ familiarity with difference . ”
because immigrants participate in america ’s economic and political arenas , americans are used to different sorts of people and so distinguish those differences that might damage the country from those that will not .
this keeps small businesses in poor nations and regions from reaching their full potential .
based on our own experiences -- in mexico , which has opened up to foreign investment and trade , and in canada , which is a leading aid donor and a major source of private investment in developing countries -- we are convinced that many of these problems can be identified , isolated and fixed .
the entrepreneurial energy is already there : visit the tiniest town in the poorest country on market day and you will see the private sector in action .
if small businesses could expand beyond the village square , they could drive their countries ' growth better than any aid agency .
this is why , when un secretary-general kofi annan and un development program administrator mark malloch brown asked us to lead a new commission on private sector and development , we agreed .
there is no guarantee that he will not repeat that gambit .
and yet , even if he does , kim ’s own penchant for drama – from firing missiles over japan to carrying out frequent purges at home – suggests that he knows how to command the stage and bring trump to the table .
moreover , his ego-stroking personal letters to trump show that he has a good fix on the president ’s psyche .
so far , he has proved to be highly effective at keeping the bromance alive , and the forthcoming summit on track .
regardless of when the second summit occurs , the north korean regime will continue to reap dividends at america ’s expense in the meantime .
amid surging inequality , frustration with pervasive corruption has intensified .
in 2018 , kazakhstan ranked 124th out of 180 countries in transparency international ’s corruption perceptions index .
meanwhile , the state is failing to provide basic security : in july 2018 , an olympic ice-skating medalist , denis ten , was murdered in broad daylight in the center of kazakhstan ’s largest city , almaty , for trying to prevent his car mirrors from being stolen .
all of this has made emigration an increasingly appealing option , especially for young people , raising the specter of a “ brain drain . ”
it has also turned up the heat on simmering social unrest , which has boiled over since nazarbayev ’s resignation ( which may well have been intended specifically to preempt popular protests ) .
but whenever the kingdom has tried to reduce public-sector hiring , unemployment has increased .
under the current incentives system , the authorities ’ plans to privatize companies and improve civil-service productivity will actually destroy jobs occupied by saudis .
the challenge of creating jobs for saudis may seem like a problem of riches .
some would argue that all the kingdom needs to do is to substitute saudi for foreign workers in existing positions .
but simple substitution will not do .
the entire point of money is that it allows parties to transact without having to barter .
but for money to have value , and to generate economies of scale , only so many currencies can operate at the same time .
in the us , the reason we do not use euros or yen in addition to dollars is obvious : doing so would be pointless , and it would make the economy far less efficient .
the idea that hundreds of cryptocurrencies could viably operate together not only contradicts the very concept of money ; it is utterly idiotic .
but so , too , is the idea that even a single cryptocurrency could substitute for fiat money .
the cool war threatens to undermine these efforts , because facing the us at the negotiating table requires china to strengthen its own position above all .
this means ensuring that disruptions caused by us short-termism do not present a long-term systemic threat to china , even as they hurt the global economy as a whole .
the unfolding sino-american cool war is far less cut and dried than the cold war was .
minimizing the fallout will require both sides to recognize that , in an interconnected world , efforts to strengthen their own position become self-defeating when they undermine global stability and dynamism .
the trade war threw this lesson into sharp relief .
studies ahead of the paris conference suggest that international cooperation could allow for rapid reduction of greenhouse gases .
they also highlight the knock-on benefits that taking quick action on climate change could have , including reduction of local pollution , greater energy and food security , and faster innovation .
to accelerate the move toward a low-carbon economy , an international agreement must be applicable to all countries ; include a common and consistent system for monitoring , reporting , and verification ; and provide strong economic incentives at a global scale .
our price-and-rebate mechanism is inspired by the “ bonus/malus ” scheme in france , in which buyers of new cars are taxed or given a bonus depending on the vehicle ’s co2 emissions .
in our system , a country exceeding the worldwide average for per capita emissions would pay a specified amount on every ton of co2 ( or its equivalent ) above a set threshold .
by buying government bonds for cash , a central bank can satisfy demand and push down the price of cash .
when there is no excess demand for cash , there will be no excess supply of the bonds and stocks that underpin and finance the economy ’s productive capital .
thus , expansionary monetary policy via standard open-market operations by a central bank is the first item on the checklist of what to do in a financial crisis .
three months ago , i argued that all but a tiny and unbalanced fringe of economists approve of expansionary open-market operations to keep total nominal spending constant in a downturn , and i was right .
i was also right to say that all but a tiny and unbalanced fringe of economists approve of central-bank guarantees of system stability , in order to prevent the risk of a collapse of the payments system from becoming a first-order consideration boosting the demand for cash to unnatural levels .
the eastward expansion of nato and the european union , they contend , was an unnecessary provocation .
in fact , none other than george kennan , the originator of america ’s cold war containment strategy , opposed nato enlargement in the 1990s on precisely these grounds .
there are obvious limits to this theory .
for starters , it is based on the claim that , at the time of the berlin wall ’s collapse and the soviet union ’s disintegration , the west promised that there would be no nato expansion .
even mikhail gorbachev , on the 25th anniversary of the wall ’s demise , accused the west of not keeping the promises it made in 1989 , instead taking “ advantage of russia ’s weakening ” in the 1990s to claim “ monopoly leadership and domination of the world , ” including through nato enlargement .
the international monetary fund has gotten in on the act , too .
even though its october world economic outlook presents a positive picture of global growth , the imf , no doubt still conscious of the panglossian view it offered in 2006 , now warns that the world economy is “ vulnerable to a sudden tightening of financial conditions ” and that “ equity valuations appear stretched in some markets . ”
in this context , “ some ” is imf code for the united states .
the us market ’s share of global equity valuations is the highest it has ever been – a remarkable statistic given the declining us share of global economic activity .
how should we view all these warnings ?
i also developed what i called the adjusted gsdeer , which corrects the “ equilibrium ” rate for the ongoing economic cycle , by accounting for factors such as the real interest-rate differential between the us and the eurozone .
which interest rate is best for making comparisons is a matter of debate , as are the effects of quantitative easing ; but i see no good reason not to use the ten-year government bond differential , adjusted for inflation expectations .
accordingly , the adjusted gsdeer for the euro-dollar exchange rate , as of june 7 , was € 1 : $ 1.0590 .
given that the dollar was trading at around $ 1.1250 against the euro on that day , this suggests that the dollar is actually around 6 % weaker than it should be .
now , of course , 6 % is not a particularly significant difference , and this finding may not mean anything at all .
the party came to a crashing halt in 2009 , when two sharp-elbowed global investment banks accelerated loan repayments – hoping to get their money back .
the kazakh government , which had been scrambling to support its overextended private banks with capital injections and nationalizations , gave up and decided to pull the plug .
the banks defaulted on their loans , and creditors took large “ haircuts ” ( reductions in principal value ) .
but – and here ’s the point – with its debts written off , the banking system is now recapitalized and able to support economic growth .
despite a messy default , this fresh start has generated a remarkable turnaround .
in the drc , for example , even after all this time we reach only 8 % of the 760,000 children .
only $ 230 per year per person is available for basic needs such as water , food , and shelter , and less than $ 10 per child goes toward education .
this year must be education ’s moment – a window of opportunity opened by a new consensus that education is critical to achieving the un sustainable development goals , including reducing maternal and infant mortality rates , spurring job creation , improving quality of life , and opening our minds to issues of gender equality .
but , most important , this is education ’s moment because the world ’s young people are demanding it .
when a girl holds a book up to an insurgent ’s gun in pakistan , when teenage mothers exiled from south sudan in neighboring uganda make education for their children their top priority , and when lights seen from space might include clusters of children huddled by candlelight trying to read and study , we know that education ’s moment has come .
president jimmy carter used it to conclude the 1978 camp david accords , establishing diplomatic relations between egypt and israel .
and secretary of state james baker used it to overcome the recalcitrance of israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir during the 1991 madrid peace conference .
if the us can not provide this today , it must relinquish its monopoly on international conflict resolution .
it is time for the us to recognize that it can not resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict , defuse the iranian nuclear dispute , change north korea ’s behavior , or stop the syrian civil war on its own .
over the last two decades , the world grew accustomed to us-led international coalitions for war in the middle east .
by appeasing the terrorists in this way , the most powerful states in the world give a green light to terrorists not only in the balkans but all over the world .
kosovo is a territory far smaller than afghanistan .
if the world fails to eliminate terrorists from politics in kosovo , what hope does it have of defeating terrorism elsewhere ?
so , before the anti-terror campaign seeks other terrorist bases to destroy , it should eliminate terror in a place where the un itself is ruling .
if not , the un , nato and the european union will discredit themselves as well as the humanitarian values they use to justify their `` humanitarian '' interventions .
if the relationship between fruit fly genes and behavior is so complex , can it be any less so with humans ?
the view that an individual gene could account for a complete biological trait is as old as genetics itself .
whether describing genes for the color of flowers in pea plants or the shape of the fruit fly 's wings , geneticists at the beginning of the last century believed that each gene governed one unique characteristic .
soon , a few of the early geneticists , founders of the eugenics movement , made the odious assertion that " licentiousness , " " shiftlessness , " and " criminality " could all be attributed to individual genes as well .
as time passed and scientific knowledge accumulated -- much of it from the fruit fly -- the true complexity of the relationship between genes and characteristics became clear .
and after all , you ca n’t have a final , utopian society without having a final , scientific theory of human behavior , together with some mad scientists or philosophes to preside over the whole thing .
the problem is that , no matter how “ scientifically ” these new beliefs were formulated , they are still false .
capitalism is , among other things , a struggle between individual people over the control of scarce resources .
like boxing and poker , it is a soft , restrained , private form of warfare .
military strategists have known for centuries that there is , and can be , no final science of war .
paris – earlier this week , following days of tense discussions , the new government in athens reached an agreement with its eurozone creditors that includes a package of immediate reforms and a four-month extension of the financial assistance program .
but , despite europe 's collective sigh of relief , the compromise does not preclude the need for further tough negotiations on a new financial-assistance program that should be introduced by the end of june .
in any negotiation , a key variable influencing the protagonists ' behavior , hence the outcome , is what failure to reach an agreement would cost each of them .
in this case , the issue is the cost of greece 's exit ( “ grexit " ) from the eurozone – a prospect that was widely discussed in the media throughout the recent negotiation , with considerable speculation about the stance of the various players , especially the greek and german governments .
from greece 's perspective , leaving the euro would be highly disruptive , which explains why there is very little support for it in the country .
elections in countries that have been strangers to democracy are never pretty , as afghanistan 's recent vote demonstrated and as any election in iraq is likely to be .
but electoral flaws are not always the whole picture .
consider kazakhstan , where five million people cast ballots in september for their parliament 's lower house .
western media judged the election a failure .
cnn reported it " neither equitable nor free . "
it is largely a matter of providing public goods : basic infrastructure like roads , bridges , ports , and power , as well as access to education and basic health care .
and , unlike many equally poor countries , india already has a very strong entrepreneurial class , a reasonably large and well-educated middle class , and a number of world-class corporations that can be enlisted in the effort to provide these public goods .
satisfying the demand for such goods is itself a source of growth .
but , also , a reliable road creates tremendous additional activity , as trade increases between connected areas , and myriad businesses , restaurants , and hotels spring up along the way .
as india did away with the stultifying license raj in the 1990 ’s , successive governments understood the imperative of economic growth , so much so that the bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) contested the 2004 election on a pro-development platform , encapsulated in the slogan , “ india shining . ”
its infrastructure , both material and intellectual , was poorer , and its economic structure was unfit for the new challenges , owing both to firm size and their specialization in traditional sectors , as well as low levels of education and r & d.
yet the berlusconi government did next to nothing to address these deficiencies , despite being the first government in italy ’s history to survive a full five-year electoral term .
with an unassailable parliamentary majority , it could have undertaken coherent supply-side reforms , even at the risk of some initial unpopularity .
a couple of reforms were belatedly enacted : timid intervention on pensions and a further increase in labor-market flexibility .
but nothing was done to deregulate product markets or to give proper incentives to restructuring , while privatization came to a halt .
despite civil wars , malnutrition , and the anguish of the aids epidemic , something remarkable is happening in black africa : the stealthy rise of a high-technology sector .
if not quite representing an african " silicon valley , " these shoots of high-tech industry nonetheless can and must be nurtured if africa is to thrive .
consider what is happening on several floors of a single high-rise office building in accra , ghana 's capital .
there some 1,500 africans process american health-insurance claims - working around the clock , in three shifts .
the africans speak english , type at least 50 words a minute on a computer , take data from paper claim forms supplied by us health insurers via satellite in electronic form , put it into new digital forms , and ship them back to the us .
yet the westphalian system was destroyed by the two world wars of the first half of the twentieth century – both of which were in fact european wars for world domination .
when the guns fell silent in 1945 , the europeans – even the victorious european allies – had effectively lost their sovereignty .
the westphalian system was replaced by the cold war bipolar order , wherein sovereignty rested with the two non-european nuclear powers : the united states and the soviet union .
the eu was conceived as an attempt to regain european sovereignty peacefully , by pooling the national interests of european states .
the goal of this effort has always been to prevent a relapse into the old system of power rivalries , reciprocal alliances , and hegemonic head butting .
in october and november , the ecb will announce the results of its bank stress tests .
because many banks hold a large volume of eurozone government debt , the results will depend very much on how the ecb assesses sovereign risk .
if the ecb grossly understates the risks , its credibility as a regulator will be badly tarnished .
if it is more forthright about the risks , there is a chance that some periphery countries might have difficulty plugging the holes , and will require help from the north .
one hopes that the ecb will be forthright .
researchers should use fully representative test groups , while taking care to adhere to stringent privacy and accountability protocols .
of course , such initiatives cost money .
venture capital companies now spend $ 3.2 billion annually on global health research and development .
they should expand the scope of their investments to include ai-enabled technologies for mental-health-care delivery .
they could also fund competitions among socially conscious technology entrepreneurs , in order to spur further innovation in this area .
yet the teaching-hospital model could be effective in public policy , too .
consider , for example , harvard university ’s growth lab , which i founded in 2006 after two highly fulfilling policy engagements in el salvador and south africa .
since then , we have worked on over three dozen countries and regions .
in some respects , the lab looks a bit like a teaching and research hospital .
it focuses both on research and on the clinical work of serving “ patients , ” or governments in our case .
and the us had as much regard for british industrialists ’ trade secrets as china has today for american intellectual property rights .
the fledgling textile mills of new england were desperate for technology and did their best to steal british designs and smuggle in skilled british craftsmen .
the us did have patent laws , but they protected only us citizens .
as one historian of us business has put it , the americans “ were pirates , too . ”
any sensible international trade regime must start from the recognition that it is neither feasible nor desirable to restrict the policy space countries have to design their own economic and social models .
making all these changes will be difficult .
but if the world moves in this direction , something along the lines of a new conclave of political global power will begin to take shape , and that will be the beginnings of a new international system .
the second great change – ie , the end of global ideological division – also raises difficult and , perhaps , more complex issues .
there exists today a basic , even on an occasion a ritualistic , consensus regarding the notion that democracy and human rights are the points of departure for political organization with some form of free market with varying degrees of social responsibility based on private entrepreneurship as the basis for economic activity .
yes , one can debate about the third way , or the two and a half way , or the three and a half way , but these are essentially marginal debates .
it would offer returns close to those yielded by equity investments , but with some of the risk offset by its long-term nature .
risk would be further mitigated through the participation of large , influential investors , including sovereign wealth funds , pension funds , and possibly international financial institutions .
public contributions , likely backstopped by multilateral lenders , would provide projects with something close to sovereign risk profiles .
finally , the regulated nature of cash flows would allow for better pre-defined return structures than traditional private or public equity can offer .
the development of bhe would require a new private-sector investment platform , structured to provide bespoke returns for its different participants .
capital inflows – which will undoubtedly increase in the coming years – are driven largely by investors ’ interest in diversification and high yield , rather than the country ’s image as a refuge from troubled financial markets elsewhere , especially given that china ’s financial markets are relatively underdeveloped and beset by considerable risks .
of course , some foreign central banks have signed currency-swap agreements with china and even hold small amounts of its currency in their reserve portfolios .
but these actions may be less a sign of the renminbi ’s inevitable march toward global dominance than a low-cost bet on its likely emergence as a widely accepted international currency .
and countries ’ desire to maintain good relations with china , owing to its rising economic power , can not be discounted .
depending on how soon china opens up its capital account and develops its financial markets , the renminbi could become a significant reserve currency in the near future .
the peasants in guerrero cultivate amapola for the cartels , not for their own livelihood .
and the us drug enforcement administration will not look kindly on any backtracking from previous mexican presidents ’ commitments to continue waging a costly , bloody , and futile war of choice on drugs in mexico .
there are other issues on the us-mexican agenda , of course , ranging from intelligence sharing and counter-terrorism to regional crises such as venezuela , nicaragua , and possibly cuba .
amlo will almost certainly maintain mexican cooperation on the first set of issues , while retreating to mexico ’s traditional and archaic anti-interventionist stance on regional diplomacy .
but trump cares more about security than he does about venezuelan president nicolás maduro or nicaragua ’s daniel ortega , so a real rupture here may be avoided .
in 2015 , enabled by a new constitution , burundi ’s president , pierre nkurunziza , won a third term amid violent protests .
the same year , similar protests erupted in the democratic republic of congo , following the introduction of a law that would allow president joseph kabila to prolong his tenure .
the au should show leadership in this area , pursuing interventions that buttress constitutional democracy , in line with its agenda 2063 .
the au has resisted military coups in the past .
on the heels of its success in sudan , it must stand against “ constitutional coups ” carried out by presidents , as it establishes itself more firmly as a force for peace and democratic governance in africa .
higher fertility rates in the us , the uk , and france reflect the large number of immigrant families in each country .
fertility rates among immigrants are typically higher than in native european or north american families .
but increasing the number of immigrant workers will not necessarily raise fertility rates .
germany , for example , has a large population of guest workers , but few settle there with their families ; most leave their children in their homeland .
an aging population contributes to europe 's poor economic performance .
of course , there were no consequences whatsoever for cheney .
the news barely made a ripple in the us media .
impunity is widespread – indeed , most corporate crimes go un-noticed .
the few that are noticed typically end with a slap on the wrist , with the company – meaning its shareholders – picking up a modest fine .
the real culprits at the top of these companies rarely need to worry .
greene found that people asked to make a moral judgment about “ personal ” violations , like pushing the stranger off the footbridge , showed increased activity in areas of the brain associated with the emotions .
this was not the case with people asked to make judgments about relatively “ impersonal ” violations like throwing a switch .
moreover , the minority of subjects who did consider that it would be right to push the stranger off the footbridge took longer to reach this judgment than those who said that doing so would be wrong .
why would our judgments , and our emotions , vary in this way ?
for most of our evolutionary history , human beings – and our primate ancestors – have lived in small groups , in which violence could be inflicted only in an up-close and personal way , by hitting , pushing , strangling , or using a stick or stone as a club .
in today ’s more complicated legal environment , it will take years to negotiate trade deals with the eu and then other partners .
political uncertainty is high , and there is no prospect of a general election to resolve it anytime soon .
investors have every reason to adopt a wait-and-see attitude .
in 1949 , britain found itself in the same position , with a trade deficit vis-à-vis the united states and weak investor confidence .
in september of that year , sterling was again devalued , as it had been 18 years before , by 30 % .
once in power , erbakan tempered his tone and actions .
turkey continued to allow the u.s.-led " operation provide comfort " against iraq to use turkish bases .
it remained a vital member of nato .
relations with israel actually improved with more visits by ranking turkish officials than ever before -- a move orchestrated by ciller but accepted by refah .
power actually led refah to compromise , not to extremes .
new york – in 1893 , the playwright george bernard shaw , an ardent proponent of women ’s suffrage and equality , wrote mrs. warren ’s profession , a play whose title character is the proprietor of several brothels .
the play justifies her profitable exploitation of the business of prostitution from a feminist standpoint .
the play is not salacious , and it contains no coarse language , but it was nonetheless eight years before it could be staged .
its opening in london in 1902 was staged in a small theater “ club , ” ostensibly limited to members .
its performance in new york in 1905 was raided by the police .
nairobi/paris – africa is on the verge of an unemployment crisis portending profound economic , political , and social ramifications .
but the crisis can be averted , and one of the solutions may be as simple as turning on the lights .
every year , some 13 million young people look for work in africa , but only about three million of them find jobs .
the continent ’s youth population is projected to double by 2050 , to 840 million , and yet africa ’s schools and universities are not producing enough graduates with the technical skills to succeed in the workplace of tomorrow .
although the african development bank ( afdb ) hopes to create 25 million new jobs within a decade through its jobs for youth in africa initiative , it is not immediately clear where those opportunities will come from .
they did not calculate that the palestinian people have dignity and national pride , just like any other nation , and will insist on being treated accordingly .
let us be clear : the two-state solution does not mean accommodating the illegal reality of israeli settlements ; rather , it means ending this colonial enterprise .
refusing to mention the two-state solution , the statements of trump ’s team go in a different direction , more in line with israel ’s official position : one state and two systems .
but no palestinian , arab , or responsible international leader would ever accept this design , as has been made clear in messages delivered by world leaders to the trump administration .
now , plans are afoot to “ promote a future of peace and security in the middle east ” through a us-polish conference in warsaw , where palestinians are not going to participate .
in any case , it is not as if avoiding talk about israel is a departure for sanders .
despite having commented on the matter where necessary , he has generally not been outspoken on issues relating to the country .
he has certainly never embraced israel as a political cause , as many other american jewish politicians have .
nor does israel appear to figure much in his own jewish identity , which is more connected to the memory of the holocaust than anything else .
in this respect , sanders is no different than many other american jews .
king salman embraced trump ’s war against terrorism and anti-iran rhetoric , and expressed support for an israeli-palestinian peace .
nothing was said about human rights , much less women ’s rights , and the word “ democracy ” never passed trump ’s lips .
instead , trump completed a deal to provide $ 110 billion in advanced weaponry to saudi arabia , which in turn will invest heavily in the us economy .
the agreement appears to have become the foundation of a wonderful new friendship , between the world ’s oldest democracy and its most repressive islamic regime .
for trump , as for president calvin coolidge , the chief business of the american people is business .
since gold was $ 400 an ounce in both years , holding gold did nothing to offset the fall in the value of the dollar .
a japanese investor who held dollar equities or real estate could instead have offset the exchange rate loss by buying yen futures .
the same is true for the euro-based investor who would not have gained by holding gold but could have offset the dollar decline by buying euro futures .
in short , there are better ways than gold to hedge inflation risk and exchange-rate risk .
tips , or their equivalent from other governments , provide safe inflation hedges , and explicit currency futures can offset exchange-rate risks .
munich – because china has pegged its undervalued currency , the renminbi , to the dollar , every weakening of the dollar in the wake of america ’s financial crisis has also meant a weakening of the renminbi vis-à-vis other world currencies .
but is china really to blame for the eruption of a global currency war ?
the central banks of south korea , brazil , taiwan , japan , switzerland , and many other countries are now buying dollars in order to protect their own currencies against revaluation and thus to defend their exports .
europe also became nervous after the euro exchange rate rose to more than $ 1.40 , far beyond the purchasing power parity ( ppp ) rate of $ 1.17 .
the united states is now taking drastic steps against china , and is making provisions for a trade war .
but while these sources can provide valuable insights , they do not meet the standards of methodological rigor and conceptual clarity on which an informed public conversation should be based .
for these reasons , researchers , the media , and civil-society organizations need to get more involved .
it is critical that we develop an internationally recognized set of indicators and methods for tracking income and wealth .
government statistical agencies should be publishing the income and wealth levels of the top 1 % , 0.1 % , and 0.001 % , as well as the effective taxes paid by these groups .
to that end , a particularly important milestone will come with a revision , due in the next three years , of the united nations system of national accounts .
eliminating federal subsidies for health-insurance coverage under the affordable care act ( “ obamacare ” ) would save the government a little over $ 100 billion a year , about 3 % of federal spending .
but those subsidies are largely paid for by their own dedicated taxes .
moreover , trump and congressional republicans are learning that replacing obamacare is easier said than done .
health-care reform , as hillary clinton could have told them , is fearsomely complex .
it is increasingly clear that the name will change ( “ trumpcare , ” anyone ? ) , and it can be expected that the republican plan will cover fewer people ; but much of the substance will remain the same .
during cardoso 's tenure , he privatized telecoms , the national mining company and part of the electric sector .
inflation fell , but unemployment , public debt , and urban violence all rose sharply .
social inequalities heightened , and last year brazil suffered blackouts and electricity rationing .
from the start of the campaign , lula showed strength , especially after the right 's favored candidate , roseana sarney , crashed and burned when federal police and prosecutors discovered a load of cash in her husband 's office .
mr. and mrs. sarney were eventually absolved of all charges , but not soon enough to save her candidacy .
in case you think that people receiving such a windfall will spend it on alcohol , gambling , or prostitution , an independent evaluation has shown that they do n’t .
give directly ’s cash transfers increase recipients ’ food security , mental health , and assets .
for $ 450 million , you could also buy 180 million bed nets , enough to protect 271 million people from malaria .
( for all these interventions , the numbers are likely to be somewhat smaller , because the charity impact calculator is not designed for such large sums , and so does not take into account that costs will rise once the needs of those who are easiest to reach have been met . )
when a person chooses to buy “ salvator mundi ” rather than restore sight to nine million people , what does that say about their values ?
the mail managers will also handle incoming messages and facebook , linkedin , and other requests as specified by the recipient , and will collect credit card information from senders ( or more likely charge their paypal accounts or navigate other payment systems as they emerge ) .
the recipient is unlikely to see the complexities ; most of this will be handled in the background .
to start , you can simply set your price at , say , $ 1 , along with a list of people who can reach you for free .
there will be lots of glitches at the beginning , starting with people you know who have multiple e-mail addresses , old friends not on your current white list of free senders , and so on .
but such challenges will diminish over time , and , as less mail gets sent , a higher proportion of it will be wanted and answered .
in trade and immigration , for example , bannon ’s acquired philosophy aligned with trump ’s political opportunism ( trump ’s more liberal , often democrat-backing former self is another story ) .
it was a mistake to see bannon as pygmalion to trump ’s galatea , or , as some did , as the trump white house ’s rasputin .
bannon reinforced the nationalist inclination that led trump to overrule his daughter ivanka and his economic advisers by withdrawing from the paris climate agreement .
and bannon intruded on foreign policy by getting himself put on the national security council for a while , until two of the generals in trump ’s administration – national security adviser h. r. mcmaster and john kelly ( now the chief of staff ) – got him removed .
( bannon was believed to be behind the recent push to force out mcmaster , mainly by suggesting that he is “ anti-israel . ” )
they mistrust each other too much to collaborate .
meanwhile , demand in most of the european union is weak , ruling out the economic growth needed to repay debts and offer hope to the 25 million unemployed .
parochial suspicion has been the main obstacle to a grand solution .
no country ’s taxpayers have wanted to feel that they are paying for others ’ excesses : the single currency did not impose shared responsibility .
so creditor countries , led by germany , have sought to do the minimum necessary to keep the euro alive , while debtors have grumbled impotently about germany ’s insistence on fiscal austerity .
the cheap credit ushered in by the euro fed an inflationary economic bubble in southern europe that burst when the financial crisis hit .
credit terms worsened abruptly , and what was left was the thoroughly overpriced rump of economies that had become excessively dependent on foreign financing .
the french economy , in turn , is suffering because its customers in southern europe are in trouble .
according to a study by goldman sachs , france would have to depreciate by around 20 % relative to the eurozone average , and by about 35 % vis-à-vis germany , to restore external-debt sustainability .
the ecb and the international community – particularly the international monetary fund – have tried to deal with the crisis by replacing the dearth of private capital with public credit .
the same happens even if you read philosophy , say , husserl .
the author opens at the fist page , and follows a series of questions in order for you to see how he reaches his conclusions .
encyclopedias , of course , are never meant to be read cover to cover .
if i want to know whether it was possible that napoleon met kant , i pick up volumes k and n and discover that napoleon was born in 1769 and died in 1821 , and that kant was born in 1724 and died in 1804 .
it is possible that the two met .
letting them in might produce a better team , but it would no longer be our team .
from one perspective , this is just another case of emotion defeating economic logic .
but our emotions are the algorithms , bequeathed by evolution , by which we make most decisions , including political ones ; economic cost-benefit analysis that does not connect to our emotional compass does not move the needle .
at the core of the issue is the sense of “ us . ”
what does it mean to be a member of the eu , nigeria , iraq , turkey , switzerland , or any other political entity ?
islam and democracy are frequently presumed to be bitter antagonists .
a careful study of the world 's 47 muslim-majority states , however , shows that islam and democracy can and do co-exist .
the real gap is narrower : it is the arab world , not islam , which seems at loggerheads with democracy .
this conclusion is based on comparing muslim countries ' " electoral competitiveness . "
if a government sprang from reasonably fair elections and the elected government is able to fill the most important political offices , the country is deemed " electorally competitive . "
( if anything , these standards are excessively burdensome . )
on the other hand , swiss bioengineer martin fussenegger correctly observed that the venter achievement “ is a technical advance , not a conceptual one . ”
other scientists noted that the organism is really only “ semi-synthetic , ” because the synthetic dna ( which comprises only about 1 % of the dry weight of the cell ) was introduced into a normal , or non-synthetic , bacterium .
understanding the history of synthetic biology is important , because recognizing the correct paradigm has critical implications for how governments regulate it , which in turn affects the potential application and diffusion of the technology .
thirty-five years ago , the us national institutes of health adopted overly risk-averse guidelines for research using recombinant dna , or “ genetic engineering , ” techniques .
paris – with weak demand in advanced countries now impeding growth in emerging economies , including major players in asia and latin america , many are arguing that the era of income convergence has come to an end .
nothing could be further from the truth .
as i have argued before , convergence of emerging countries ’ real average incomes , in the aggregate , with advanced countries ’ incomes is likely to continue into the 2020 ’s .
that process started in the late 1980 ’s , and continued unabated , except in the years around the asian financial crisis in 1997-1998 .
the pace of convergence accelerated further during , and just after , the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 : the aggregate average differential in per capita income growth increased to more than four percentage points in the 2008-2012 period , from a little more than two percentage points in the two decades before .
this belief has suited the two main political parties .
labour has sought to avoid a constitutional debate , because any move in the direction of federal institutions requires addressing the party ’s over-representation in the uk parliament .
it is unfair to give ever more power to a scottish parliament while continuing to give labour , which controls 41 scottish constituencies in the house of commons , disproportionate say over what happens in england .
as for the conservatives , the party has allowed its belief in the union of the country ’s constituent parts to foreclose any discussion of how that union can be modernized .
if we are to prevent the uk from rattling to pieces , we have to change the way we govern ourselves .
this means reaching out to public figures to request on-the-record corrections , lodging complaints with standards bodies , and providing training to media organizations .
it also means working with tech companies to find ways to prevent the wider circulation of misinformation , including across international borders .
at the same time , fact-checking organizations should not simply focus on tackling false information , but also on identifying sources of reliable information and pointing their readers and followers to them .
and we should work with schools and other educational platforms to help teach people to identify false or misleading claims .
this is the approach taken by our organizations , and as small and under-resourced as they are , the impact is already apparent .
london – one of the most dispiriting features of today ’s international debates is that the threat to humanity posed by the world ’s 23,000 nuclear weapons – and by those who would build more of them , or be only too willing to use them – has been consigned to the margin of politics .
us president barack obama did capture global attention with his prague speech in 2009 , which made a compelling case for a nuclear weapon-free world .
and he did deliver on a major new arms-reduction treaty with russia , and hosted a summit aimed at reducing the vulnerability of nuclear weapons and materials to theft or diversion .
but nuclear issues still struggle for public resonance and political traction .
it would take a brave gambler to bet on ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty by the us senate any time soon .
it seems self-evident that a developed economy requires adequate , ongoing investment in public goods .
but the state of infrastructure in the us suggests that many decision-makers do not share this view .
a 2013 report by the american society of civil engineers gave the us a pathetic overall grade of d + for its infrastructure .
the report cited numerous state-specific shortcomings , including michigan ’s “ 88 high-hazard dams and 1,298 structurally deficient bridges ” and the “ $ 44.5 billion needed to upgrade drinking-water systems ” in california .
the report concludes that a $ 3.6 trillion investment ( roughly one-fifth of the country ’s annual gdp ) will be needed by 2020 to boost the quality of us infrastructure by addressing the “ significant backlog of overdue maintenance [ and the ] pressing need for modernization . ”
the second myth presumes that prohibition reduces the harm associated with drugs .
global markets in cannabis , opium and coca products are basically similar to other global commodities markets , yet global drug control policies operate on the assumption that the drug markets bear more in common with smallpox and other infectious diseases for which there is no demand .
governments can act unilaterally and multilaterally to regulate commodity markets , but it is a mistake to perceive prohibition as the ultimate or maximum form of regulation .
prohibition in fact represents the abdication of regulation .
whatever is not suppressed is effectively unregulated , except by criminal organizations .
this is for the best of reasons - fish that are caught when they are too small will produce a small yield .
moreover , the fish will not have had a chance to reproduce , undermining the fish stock altogether .
for example , the avowed intention of the eu common fisheries policy is " to protect fish resources by regulating the amount of fish taken from the sea , by allowing young fish to reproduce , and by ensuring that measures are respected . "
as it stands , however , we have " fished down " our stocks , until few large , old individuals remain .
to see this , consider north sea cod .
official surveys insist that 86 % of russians – and it is usually 86 % – support him on everything from the annexation of crimea to his latest term as president .
but putin ’s ambitions as a post-modern autocrat may be his achilles ’ heel .
after all , autocrats often mistake their people ’s proclamations of love and admiration for the real thing .
the truth about what people genuinely feel remains impossible to know .
with the russian economy stagnating , owing largely to international sanctions and kremlin counter-sanctions , discontent will continue to simmer .
but it was probably in hungary , the first country to seek an imf package , that these practices were most widespread .
yet this vulnerability was largely created , or at least accommodated , by western banks .
the funding from the parent banks that in the earlier phase of the crisis helped provide liquidity to the east european banking systems now appears more as a liability and possible source of contagion .
it was also the west european financial regulators and supervisors who , under “ home rule , ” were supposed to discourage these excesses .
the penetration of foreign banks has also effectively deprived countries in central and eastern europe of monetary policy tools , leaving them with little control over extremely rapid credit growth .
add to this the mismanagement of ethnic and religious diversity , stir in a large and growing cohort of unemployed and digitally connected youth , and the continent offers ideal conditions for mayhem .
emulating countries elsewhere , african governments have responded to violent extremism primarily by putting “ hard ” security first .
but this strategy has not reduced extremist groups ’ potency or limited their reach .
in fact , there is evidence that an exclusively military response can be a waste of resources , or even do more harm than good .
what is missing is a deeper examination of root causes , particularly underlying development challenges .
moreover , wherever health-care costs are paid by everyone – including the us , with its public health-care programs for the poor and the elderly – everyone pays the cost of efforts to treat the diseases caused by cigarettes .
whether to prohibit cigarettes altogether is another question , because doing so would no doubt create a new revenue source for organized crime .
it seems odd , however , to hold that the state may , in principle , prohibit the sale of a product , but may not permit it to be sold only in packs that carry graphic images of the damage it causes to human health .
the tobacco industry will now take its battle against australia ’s legislation to the world trade organization .
the industry fears that the law could be copied in much larger markets , like india and china .
the united nations framework convention has refused to fund disaster preparedness efforts unless states demonstrate exactly how the disasters they feared were linked to climate change .
according to a recent rand study , the united states ’ funding for disaster loss-reduction research in 2003 amounted to about $ 127 million – only 7 % of the amount invested in climate-change research for that year .
climate change policies are not the best way to reduce the effects of weather disasters .
during the 2004 hurricane season , the dominican republic , which has invested in hurricane shelters and emergency evacuation networks , suffered fewer than ten deaths .
in neighboring haiti , which was n’t prepared , 2,000 lives were lost .
the brisbane summit ’s signature achievement was to leverage the just-announced us-china emission target into formal g-20 support for “ strong and effective action to address climate change . ”
the g-20 ’s stance represents a powerful challenge to the rest of the world to reach a global agreement at the united nations climate change conference in paris in december 2015 .
( all of this dismayed australia ’s conservative host government , which had fought to prevent the issue from even being raised ; the australian public , however , was delighted , and promptly knocked down prime minister tony abbott ’s approval rating in post-summit polls for this and other embarrassments . )
other formal outcomes of the g-20 meeting were agreements – backed by more policy detail than most commentators had expected – to stimulate global growth .
in particular , the leaders focused on investment , trade , competition , and efforts to bring more women into the workforce ; the fairness of the international tax system ; and how to target corruption .
if you want to impress russian president vladimir putin or other foreign dignitaries , hosting them in such a magisterial setting as versailles is sure to prove effective .
but reveling in the country ’s monarchical history can be dangerous .
many of those who voted for macron may have been hoping for a twenty-first-century bonaparte .
but now they may be thinking more of louis xvi , the king who paid with his life for the faults of his predecessors .
can macron learn from his mistakes and regain the confidence of french voters who have felt humiliated by him ?
and that is what the economy got in the form of unprecedented fiscal stimulus and unthinkable policy activism on the part of the us federal reserve .
as they intervened , american policymakers consulted closely with their counterparts around the world , urging them to take supportive steps .
and they did , culminating in one of the most successful periods of global policy coordination in history , involving both advanced and emerging economies .
for many , the global economic summit held in london in april 2009 marks the point when the us economy turned the corner .
the change was so notable that many policymakers fell into the trap of projecting a quick rebound , especially given america ’s prior history of economic dynamism and resilience , only to be humbled by what has proven to be a protracted and complex process of recovery .
fear feeds on itself , and the prediction that stocks will lose value becomes self-fulfilling .
the 2008 recession was triggered by the collapse of a real-estate bubble .
housing wealth in the us has fallen by 34 % since its peak in 2006 , and is still declining .
the stock market fell by almost 50 % from its 2007 peak and remains down by nearly a third .
this enormous loss of wealth caused a large and persistent drop in consumption demand , which has led to an increase in unemployment .
the billionaire american casino owner sheldon adelson , for example , did n’t purchase the las vegas review-journal in 2015 or capture israeli media for the money .
as the media landscape increasingly lends itself to capture , political and corporate accountability will only decline .
that is why the center for international media assistance has just released a new report shining a spotlight on the phenomenon – and calling for solutions .
free and healthy news media are essential to a well-functioning democracy .
if we are to protect the latter , we must defend the former at all costs .
until now , merkel had to deal with a weak or non-existent opposition .
this will change very quickly , particularly given the possibility of nato troop increases in afghanistan .
from now on , she will require a trait that she has lacked so far : leadership and decision-making skills .
the victory of black and yellow has , moreover , defined the alternative : red , dark red , and green .
the political camps of old – left and right – are back for the time being .
instead , we need to integrate transportation , housing , and land use , encourage reliance on public transportation , and make our streets pleasant and safe for walking ( especially for women and the disabled ) .
the fourth challenge is to change how we produce , transport , and consume energy .
this includes creating more efficient energy systems and increasing our investment in renewable sources ( which will , one hopes , create jobs in the process ) .
we can also encourage households to consume less energy , and companies to reduce the amount of energy that they waste .
fifth , we must reform how we manage water resources and water infrastructure , so that this precious resource can be re-used several times , and on a city-wide scale .
ramallah – israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu certainly has reason to celebrate .
he surprised nearly everyone by securing a decisive electoral victory , winning a third consecutive term in office after his right-wing likud party gained a five-seat advantage in the knesset over its main rival , the center-left zionist union .
but the celebration is likely to be short .
the way netanyahu finagled this outcome – renouncing his commitment to a two-state solution with palestine and pledging to continue building settlements on occupied land – will almost certainly have serious political and diplomatic consequences for israel .
in recent years , netanyahu ’s hardline stance has increasingly undermined israel ’s international credibility , while convincing the palestinians living in the occupied territories that a genuine agreement with israel is impossible .
an early test of the extent of the kremlin 's commitment to the minsk agreement should be whether it frees nadiya savchenko , ukraine 's first woman fighter pilot .
savchenko has been on a hunger strike in russia for more than two months to protest her patently illegal incarceration on charges even more ludicrous than those for which i was imprisoned .
of course i hope that the new agreement will last , finally bringing peace to ukraine .
but such an outcome is unlikely , given that the agreement lacks any enforcement mechanism , such as the automatic eviction of russia from the swift financial transfer system should it renege on any aspect of the agreement .
simply trusting the kremlin 's “ goodwill " would be reckless .
why waste precious work time in the air , at security checks , and waiting for our luggage ?
before anyone starts slashing travel budgets , let ’s try to understand why we need to move people rather than information .
thanks to a research collaboration on inclusive growth with mastercard and an anonymized donation of data to the center for international development at harvard university , we are starting to shed some light on this mystery .
in ongoing work with dany bahar , michele coscia , and frank neffke , we have been able to establish some interesting stylized facts .
more populous countries have more business travel in both directions , but the volume is less than proportional to their population : a country with 100 % more population than another has only about 70 % more business travel .
too many italians shrugged their shoulders at berlusconi ’s lies and failings , figuring that he would soon go away , having done little harm .
but he did not go away , and he did plenty of harm .
the us can not afford to make the same mistake .
the price of liberty , americans are fond of saying , is eternal vigilance .
in confronting trump , there can be no discount .
and , though the government recognizes the need for growth-enhancing reform , its approach is all wrong .
specifically , president ollanta humala recently won legislative approval of a set of “ realistic ” procedures to reduce the red tape perceived to be hampering investment in the extractive industries – the very industries on which the economy should become less dependent .
the new law seriously weakens peru ’s ability to regulate land use , set environmental quality standards , and rein in corporate misconduct through environmental-impact assessments .
the peruvian government now has a serious problem .
beyond diminishing peru ’s international credibility as a “ climate champion ” – an image that some members of the government have been attempting to cultivate – the law jeopardizes peru ’s natural environment and economic-growth prospects .
fifa and the government ’s response to brazil ’s recent protests are putting at risk what the paquim exhibit commemorates : the rebirth of freedom and democracy .
the problem for the government of president dilma rousseff , who was herself imprisoned and tortured under the military regime , is that brazilians know exactly what is at stake .
when pundits weigh in on emerging powers like brazil and india , they typically point to the rise of the middle class and booms in education and connectivity .
but they rarely appreciate the texture of their democracy and civil society – the relative newness of hard-won freedoms and the intimate understanding of what tyranny , whether a homegrown dictatorship or a colonial administration , means to individual liberty .
( still less do they notice the role that women ’s empowerment and feminism have played in development . )
how can nato help with this ?
directly , it can do nothing ; indirectly , it can do a lot .
nato is no longer only a military alliance .
instead , it is now a military-political alliance that sets democratic standards for new members and aspirants .
no romanian government can neglect these standards .
a revolutionary delusion has collapsed , leaving behind only the tyrannical rule of a class of corrupt tycoons – effectively a mafia – that has purchased the military ’s loyalty with massive cash bonuses and lucrative oil-smuggling and drug-trafficking deals .
the mafia ’s opponents are repressed , often brutally .
in terms of the number of political prisoners , maduro ’s venezuela has joined the ranks of china , cuba , and turkey .
one might expect us president donald trump ’s administration to minimize maduro ’s repressive practices .
but trump was also quick to recognize the leader of the opposition , juan guaidó , as interim head of state , after guaidó , with widespread support among venezuelans , invoked a constitutional provision to challenge maduro ’s legitimacy .
but , so far , efforts to lower funding costs have had a limited impact .
indeed , the weighted average interest rate on bank credit to nonfinancial enterprises remains close to 7 % , while economic growth has edged down from 7.4 % year on year in the last three months to 7.3 % in the current quarter .
the situation may not be dire yet , but it is far from ideal – especially at a time when the chinese authorities are pursuing structural reform .
the pboc now faces a dilemma .
if it loosens monetary policy further – by , say , cutting banks ’ reserve requirement ratio – the momentum for restructuring could be lost ; and there is no guarantee that the additional liquidity would flow into the real sector .
drafted with reference to un resolution 181 ( which partitioned palestine in 1947 ) , such a motion would reaffirm the establishment of a palestinian state and a state for the jewish people , based on the 1967 borders , with mutually agreed border adjustments and security arrangements .
while such an approach would certainly fall short of maximalist palestinian demands , it would embrace the parameters outlined in may by us president barack obama .
it would also indirectly address the israeli government ’s demand that the palestinians recognize a “ jewish state . ”
such a vote would also address international calls for bilateral diplomacy .
instead of closing doors , such a redefinition of the statehood bid at the un would provide the palestinian leadership with a much-needed symbolic success , including a framework from which to restart negotiations – a longstanding palestinian demand .
given that ongoing changes in the means of production have already kick-started this trend , gates and some in the european parliament have suggested that robots be taxed to pay for human services .
whether that is the best solution is now the topic of much debate ; but , clearly , some kind of compromise will need to be made .
robotics and ai will also raise profound ethical issues for liberal politicians , particularly with respect to privacy and safety .
fortunately , there is a broader political consensus on this issue than on taxation .
the european parliament has proposed a voluntary code of conduct for engineers and others working in the field of robotics .
" everything . . . everything changes . "
so goes the refrain in a famous argentine song .
but actually , in argentina everything stays the same or becomes worse .
heraclitus 's warning against bathing in the same sea twice is lost on our economic ministers , who insist on bathing regularly in contaminated waters .
whenever they go bathing , they follow the same path , first raising concerns over what will happen if argentina pays back its foreign debt , and then inevitably paying back the debt under strong pressure from the international monetary fund and the us .
shanghai – as the existing international order becomes more fragmented , strong global-governance institutions are crucial for addressing the world ’s strategic , economic , and sustainability challenges .
and yet rarely have our existing institutions – including , above all , the united nations – been frailer .
the un is not broken , but it is in trouble , particularly as more countries treat it as a polite diplomatic afterthought and seek solutions to major global problems elsewhere .
we ’ve seen this on issues ranging from syria to iran , north korea , terrorism , cyber security , asylum-seekers and refugees , migration , ebola , and the emerging crisis in humanitarian-aid funding .
while the un still has many strengths , it also has clear structural weaknesses .
the decision to launch february 15 as a day of mass protest was apparently taken at a meeting of activists at the european social forum in florence in november last year .
in ninety days , these organizers turned out more than 5 million protestors worldwide .
there are three keys to this phenomenon :
the internet allowed for a rapid worldwide dissemination of organizational plans at an extraordinarily low cost to the organizers .
mass action depended on local organizations seizing the initiative , based on a loose global plan .
how better to memorialize that decision than with a building boom at the prison ?
the new facility for which the money is to be earmarked will house 106 prisoners ( the precise number is uncertain ) who have been neither tried nor charged .
eight of the prisoners are now entering the second month of a hunger strike .
according to the spokesman for the us southern command , which oversees gitmo , the hunger strikers are disillusioned , because they believed obama ’s pledge to close gitmo .
indeed , they are cleared to leave , and it is only obama ’s failure to keep his promise – and the us congress ’s failure to legislate their transfer – that is keeping them there .
flows of technology and innovation : increased technology ( and knowledge ) flows between china and the rest of the world would support the development of globally competitive , productivity-enhancing solutions ; decreased flows would undermine global productivity .
the world can also decide how to facilitate more or fewer flows of technologies that are increasingly subject to security reviews .
according to our simulation , $ 8-12 trillion could be at stake , depending on the extent to which technology flows unleash innovation and productivity growth .
it is important to note that these choices are not just china ’s ; the world also has decisions to make .
for example , by working together to reform the global trading system in ways that strengthen dispute resolution and boost inclusiveness , countries could ensure that the benefits from increased chinese ( and other ) trade are shared broadly .
whereas greece remains mired in depression , iceland – which is not in the eurozone – has essentially recovered .
to be sure , as the american economist barry eichengreen argued in 2007 , technical considerations make exiting the eurozone difficult , expensive , and dangerous .
but that is just one side of the ledger .
using iceland as our measuring stick , the cost to greece of not exiting the eurozone is equivalent to 75 % of a year ’s gdp – and counting .
it is hard for me to believe that if greece had abandoned the euro in 2010 , the economic fallout would have amounted to even a quarter of that .
last march , as rumors circulated that he was losing the vote , maliki asserted that state security would be threatened if he lost , noting his responsibility to maintain order .
when he did lose , he demanded a recount , not as a candidate , but in his capacity as commander-in-chief .
the fact that maliki , despite his incumbency , has been unable to secure a second term seven months after the elections attests to the widespread opposition to his continued rule among iraq ’s political class .
there is only one way to explain the us administration ’s decision to exert such diplomatic pressure in favor of iran ’s favorite in iraq : obama ’s pledge during his presidential election campaign to disengage from iraq during his first term .
in this , obama is following the example of president george w. bush , who let the us electoral agenda , rather than american – not to mention iraqi – national interests , dictate iraq policy .
in its emphasis on the importance of the signal , economics enters postmodernist territory .
the signal – in this case the promise to balance the books – creates the reality .
people start behaving as though the books were balanced , ignoring the fact that they are not .
when one believes the narrative , one acts in ways that make it come true .
in fact , i do not believe that osborne himself ever attached importance to the signaling effects of his pronouncements .
in response to dwindling donor funds , the ghanaian government brought the country ’s private-sector leaders together to launch the ghana malaria foundation , which currently is working to fill urgent funding gaps , but will eventually help lead a sustainable , domestic effort to eliminate malaria from the country .
this is a challenging moment in the fight against malaria .
but it ’s also a moment of opportunity .
for its part , novartis recently announced that it will invest more than $ 100 million in antimalarial r & d over the next five years , to help contain emerging resistant strains of the disease .
our focus now is on completing clinical trials for two promising new antimalarial drug candidates .
if sunnis come to believe that shia and kurds intend to treat them as second-class citizens , they will have no stake in the success of maliki ’s government and could again begin to pursue their political interests by other means , provoking another surge of sectarian violence .
worse still , factional conflict would undermine further development of a post-saddam iraqi identity .
otherwise , the country ’s various interest groups could , like lebanon ’s feuding factions , turn to outsiders to negotiate solutions to their problems .
there are good reasons for iraq to avoid lebanon ’s example in this respect .
even in the best of times , lebanon muddles through with a politically dysfunctional government and an army that operates in the shadow of a large shia-dominated militant organization .
the us had trade deficits with 101 countries in 2015 – a multilateral problem stemming from a saving shortfall that can not be effectively addressed through country-specific “ remedies . ”
that ’s not to say that america ’s trading partners should be let off the hook for unfair practices .
but it does mean that there is limited hope for resolving seemingly chronic trade deficits – and the related erosion of domestic hiring traceable to these imbalances – if the us does n’t start saving again .
alas , this plot is about to thicken .
trumponomics seems likely to exacerbate america ’s saving shortfall in the years ahead .
across the arab world , the fall of baghdad on april 9th is seen as a day of shame , reminiscent of june 5th 1967 , when israel defeated the armies of three arab countries , conquering the west bank , gaza strip , and east jerusalem in a mere six days .
arab intellectuals , and indeed the wider arab public , are now busy trying to analyze and understand the lessons of the iraqi earthquake .
meanwhile , supporters of the former ba'athist regime in iraq and others are now busy defending the same old totalitarian mindset .
their tactic has been to obstruct a clear review of the iraqi catastrophe by suggesting that any criticism of saddam 's regime is tantamount to supporting the american occupation of iraq .
for example , fahd al-fanek , a former ba'ath party member , is now a columnist for the jordanian newspaper al-ra ' i.
meanwhile , the lower current-account surplus ( as a share of gdp ) could be a result of its increased investment-income deficit .
and , while recovery in the advanced economies boosted exports , persistent overcapacity , combined with slower household-consumption growth than in 2012 , caused investment growth , though still rapid , to decline to its lowest rate in the past 11 years .
in principle , a country can run a current-account deficit or surplus continuously for decades .
but china ’s chronic surpluses are problematic .
given that china remains among the world ’s poorest countries , with per capita income amounting to less than $ 7,000 , its position as the world ’s largest exporter of capital signifies a gross misallocation of resources .
madrid – by july 29 , according to the sustainability organization global footprint network , humanity will have used up the earth ’s resource budget for the entire year .
this “ earth overshoot day ” has moved forward by an astonishing two months in the past 20 years and in 2019 it will arrive earlier than ever .
although humanity ’s increasing environmental impact manifests itself in many ways , climate change has the broadest and longest-lasting effects .
carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels account for an estimated 60 % of our ecological footprint .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
the economic boom is the only source of legitimacy that the one-party state has left .
few people , even party members , still believe in marxism-leninism , let alone maoism .
and the general discontent with official corruption and political oppression was amply demonstrated in all regions of china in 1989 .
the communist government managed to stay in power after tiananmen not just through brute force .
a semblance of political legitimacy , especially among the educated middle class , was purchased with the promise of greater wealth .
but , given the pressing housing and infrastructure shortfalls around the world , this is no longer sustainable .
urbanization may be leveling off in many advanced economies , but it will continue in emerging countries .
the world ’s 20 largest cities , 75 % of which are in asia , will need an estimated 36 million new housing units by 2025 .
moreover , in 2014 , an estimated 330 million urban households lived in substandard housing , or struggled financially due to housing costs ; that number is projected to rise to 440 million by 2025 .
even in an advanced economy such as the united states , over 40 % of california ’s population can not afford decent housing at market rates .
berkeley – one does not need to be particularly good at hearing to decipher the dog whistles being used during this year ’s election campaign in the united states .
listen even briefly , and you will understand that mexicans and chinese are working with wall street to forge lousy trade deals that rob american workers of their rightful jobs , and that muslims want to blow everyone up .
all of this fear mongering is scarier than the usual election-year fare .
it is frightening to people in foreign countries , who can conclude only that voters in the world ’s only superpower have become dangerously unbalanced .
and it is frightening to americans , who until recently believed – or perhaps hoped – that they were living in a republic based on the traditions established by george washington , abraham lincoln , and teddy and franklin roosevelt .
put in these terms , the problem is always solved by giving more to those who have the most political power .
professor nicola rossi , economic advisor to prime minister massimo d'alema , in the title of his recent book , expresses the wish that we give " less to the fathers and more to the sons . "
but if unions are powerful or seniors are in the majority ( in italy the two coincide , because seniors are the majority in all labor unions ) , the exact opposite happens .
italy 's recent budget , which neither confronted the pensions issue nor the issue of fiscal reform , demonstrates this fully .
here is the grand delusion of the budget and the finance ministry in italy .
oslo – education is a human right .
and , like other human rights , it can not be taken for granted .
across the world , 59 million children and 65 million adolescents are out of school .
more than 120 million children do not complete primary education .
behind these figures there are children and youth being denied not only a right , but opportunities : a fair chance to get a decent job , to escape poverty , to support their families , and to develop their communities .
small farmers , both women and men , are africa ’s biggest agricultural investors .
and agriculture-driven gdp growth is more than twice as effective in reducing poverty as growth in other sectors .
but african farmers encounter significant barriers to achieving their potential .
on average , they apply less than 10 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare , compared to 140 kilograms in india .
furthermore , less than 5 % of agricultural land is irrigated , and improved crop varieties are rarely used .
the question is whether decision-makers are prepared to use them .
obviously , most eu countries ’ governments are not .
but why are developing-country governments dragging their feet ?
are the risks so high that they justify the suffering that could have been avoided ?
gm foods have now been on the market in the us for more than 12 years .
of the roughly $ 200 trillion in global financial assets today , almost three-quarters are in some kind of debt instrument , including bank loans , corporate bonds , and government securities .
the derivatives market certainly helps spread risk more widely than this superficial calculation implies , but the basic point stands .
certainly , there are some good economic reasons why lenders have such an insatiable appetite for debt .
imperfect information and difficulties in monitoring firms pose significant obstacles to idealized risk-sharing instruments .
but policy-induced distortions also play an enormous role .
italian exports to china currently total roughly € 13 billion ( $ 14.7 billion ) per year , while imports are approximately € 29 billion .
moreover , a partnership with china could attract the additional capital inflows that italy sorely needs , given constrained lending by its banks .
whereas italy has received about € 14 billion in chinese investment since 2000 , chinese firms invested € 10.5 billion in 55 bri countries in the first ten months of 2018 alone , and have signed contracts for bri projects worth more than $ 80 billion .
nonetheless , there are several compelling reasons why italy should not go down this bilateral bri route with china , but rather deepen engagement with it as part of the eu ’s 2016 strategy on china .
for starters , italy ’s interests may not be aligned with those of china .
after years of economic stagnation and even crisis , the public ’s patience has worn thin .
to be sure , many latin american leaders have , in recent decades , risen to power on the promise of leveling the playing field .
and their interventions – including income redistribution , fiscal and monetary expansion , protectionism , discriminatory regulation , and capital controls – did bring some short-term benefits , particularly to the poor .
but , such measures were often plagued by populism and , ultimately , did more harm than good .
relying on commodity revenues to fund their social programs , these leaders failed to diversify their economies or improve economic fundamentals .
his eloquent resignation letter made clear that he objected not just to the syrian blunder , but to a pattern of behavior : trump ’s confusion of allies and opponents ; his willingness to abandon friends , such as the kurds ; and his trashing of alliances , such as nato .
mattis ’s friends explained in television interviews that what most troubled the retired four-star marine general and defense intellectual was not just that he could no longer affect policy , but also that his remaining in the cabinet was taken as an affirmation of trump , a position he could no longer bear .
even that doughty loyalist , senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , issued a statement on thursday afternoon that he was “ distressed ” by the departure of mattis ( a significant sign , many believe , of mcconnell ’s private worry about trump ’s effect on the republican party . )
members of congress expressed outright fear of a trump presidency without any guardrails .
the list of departures from trump ’s administration is unprecedentedly long .
the government has reinforced its security system , and have put in place a ubiquitous system of surveillance cameras .
visas are being denied to anyone active on behalf of human rights , with the unintended side effect of hurting international business in china .
but china ’s priority is not just to perpetuate economic growth .
rather , it is to encourage growth while protecting its power the monopoly .
the regime is set on proving to the world that china , once again a world power , can stage a spectacular performance , and that its voice will be heeded .
he will have to become an internationalist left-leaning leader or an internationalist right-leaning one .
only one of those appears to be a tenable option .
the traditional policies of the center-right would not easily be compatible with a strong internationalist bent .
if globalization , in its various dimensions , is to be backed by a popular majority , it will have to be accompanied by modernized social policies that provide effective help to those who need it .
at a time of continuous economic disruption , this will be all the more important .
but there is an alternative that could help appease angry citizens and mitigate the revenue loss from an outright ban on smoking : electronic cigarettes .
given that e-cigarettes merely heat a nicotine solution to produce an inhalable vapor , they release none of the carcinogenic tar of cigarette smoke , making them the ideal nicotine-delivery system for smokers seeking – or being forced – to reduce or halt their tobacco intake .
aside from being far less damaging than cigarettes , e-cigarettes are a homegrown product , invented in china in 2003 .
but , despite considerable progress in china ’s e-cigarette industry – in 2013 , shenzhen province housed 900 manufacturers of the devices , up 200 % from 2012 , and accounted for over 95 % of global e-cigarette production – traditional cigarettes still dominate the chinese market .
as yanzhong huang of the council on foreign relations recently pointed out , “ if only 1 % of china ’s smoking population turned to e-cigarettes , it would mean a market of about 3.5 million e-cigarette users . ”
the reason un climate conferences keep failing is straightforward : their agendas – centered on voluntary , quantitative targets – are fundamentally flawed .
agreeing to quantitative , universally applied emissions-reduction targets at a un conference is easy .
but countries automatically regard adherence to those targets as a sacrifice : in the effort to reduce emissions by x tons , we would lose y million jobs , and gdp will fall by $ z billion .
because there are no actual sanctions or punishment for non-compliance , when push comes to shove , governments can simply change their minds .
even if a government does try to uphold its commitments , say , by imposing new regulations on high-emitting industries , it may not obtain the desired results .
while china provides just 4 % of value added , it supplies the core components to apple at low prices .
apple can not build an iphone from scratch in the us , so it would have to search for alternative suppliers , raising its production costs considerably .
this would give chinese smartphone businesses an opportunity to seize market share from major players .
today , 80 % of global trade comprises international supply chains .
declining trade costs have allowed firms to splinter their production lines geographically , with goods processed and value added in multiple countries along the chain .
financial economists view such luck-based compensation as a sign of governance problems .
third , a higher ceo pay slice is associated with weaker accountability for poor performance .
in firms with a high ceo pay slice , the probability of a ceo turnover after bad performance ( controlling for the ceo ’s length of service ) is lower .
lower sensitivity of turnover to performance reflects less willingness on the part of directors to discipline the ceo .
finally , firms with a higher ceo pay slice are more likely to provide their ceo with option grants that turn out to be opportunistically timed .
there is only one europe , despite its diversity .
any weighty occurrence provokes repercussions across the continent .
if europe is to become one , if the european union is to take in the new postcommunist democracies - which is in the interest of all europe - a number of vital tasks must be undertaken , within the new democracies , as well as , in the european and atlantic communities .
to begin , europe must foster community in the postcommunist countries by restoring civil society .
for a living society can not be restructured from above .
the eu and the us must remain firm and united in their policy toward russia .
this approach offers the best chance of bringing an end to the current confrontation , and compelling russia to engage constructively with the west .
of course , if cooperation is to work , russia must earn back the trust that it has broken , demonstrating its commitment to abide by the treaties and international norms of behavior to which it has agreed .
when it comes to russia today , appeasement will not lead to peace ; on the contrary , a conciliatory approach will only prolong the conflict .
the sooner the west convinces russia ’s leaders that it will not back down , the sooner the conflict will be over .
nine times out of ten , nothing really serious does happen – merely a little distress to individuals or to groups .
but we run a risk of the tenth time … ”
today , greece ’s european creditors seem ready to abandon their solemn pledges on the irrevocability of the euro in order to insist on collecting some crumbs from the country ’s pensioners .
should they press their demands , forcing greece to exit , the world will never again trust the euro ’s longevity .
at a minimum , the eurozone ’s weaker members will undergo increased market pressures .
it is certainly preferable to a plutocracy , in which wealth determines status , or a gerontocracy , in which age leads one to the top , or even an aristocracy , in which what counts are inherited titles and properties .
so meritocracy seems preferable , at least at first sight .
but , on closer inspection , things are not so simple .
for many , france has long been the epitome of meritocracy .
most of those in the top reaches of not only the civil service and the judiciary , but also politics , business , and academia used to be graduates of the famous grandes écoles .
at america ’s most elite universities , for example , only around 9 % of students come from the bottom half of the population , while 74 % come from the top quarter .
most societies recognize a moral obligation to help ensure that young people can live up to their potential .
some countries even impose a constitutional mandate for equality of educational opportunities .
but in america , more is spent on the education of rich students than on the education of the poor .
as a result , the us is wasting some of its most valuable assets , with some young people – bereft of skills – turning to dysfunctional activities .
the au has now threatened sudan ’s new rulers with suspension from the group , unless they transfer power to a civilian authority .
even if sudan ’s military leaders succumb to au pressure , however , political stability is far from guaranteed .
for decades , le pouvoir used oil revenues to buy relative public quiescence through massive subsidies .
but those reserves were concentrated in the south , and were thus lost when south sudan seceded in 2011 .
and now political stability is gone .
istanbul – the challenge of ensuring adequate , nutrient-rich food for an expanding global population is a daunting one , especially given constraints on key resources like water and agricultural land .
as it stands , the two leading approaches to enriching and enlarging the world ’s food supply are genetic engineering and industrial processing with additives and chemicals .
now , a third solution is emerging : vertical farming .
academic studies have found that locally cultivated vertical farms – stacked greenhouses that use artificial light to grow crops – can provide considerable savings , which could then be passed along to consumers .
but questions about such farms ’ fundamental economics , especially for commodity crops , have persisted .
what it does mean is that the problem is political .
pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in a democracy , and politicians are loath to confront them on so fundamental an issue .
still , we need to face squarely the intergenerational issues at the core of today 's economic dilemmas .
our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a `` generational accounting '' that assures that economic risk is spread systematically across generations .
what this means is that pension and tax institutions must be designed to take better account of the changing circumstances facing different generations , rather than make fixed promises -- which most likely can not be kept , anyway -- of a certain payout in the future .
lower financing costs for public debt appear to be a net gain to society , because the government then saves on debt service and can keep taxes lower .
but any gains from lower taxes are more than offset by the losses to the private sector , which , facing higher financing costs , will invest less , in turn lowering economic growth – and thus reducing government revenues .
many steps have been taken in recent years to reinforce regulation of the banking system .
but what is proposed now will make lending for investment even less attractive and increase the incentive to concentrate sovereign risk in the banking sector .
this can only worsen europe ’s sovereign-debt problem and weaken its already meager growth prospects .
the plo has succeeded in obtaining european support for a unilateral palestinian declaration of statehood .
the only obstacle remaining to palestinian leaders are the americans .
when palestinians asked mitchell for assurances that the us would support such a statehood declaration if talks failed , mitchell responded that such a commitment would make negotiations pointless .
instead , the americans have their own ideas about how to achieve a breakthrough , especially with israel , which the obama administration believes is now the major obstacle .
to effect change in israel , the americans are launching various trial balloons .
the commercial calculus behind this business sometimes caused riots until anatomy laws allowed the bodies of executed murderers and the unclaimed dead to be used , thus reassuring middle and upper class individuals that their bodies would not be involved .
these old tensions have assumed new dimensions as the commercial potential of human tissue catches the entrepreneurial imagination .
but few laws are in place to address the uses of cells , tissues , and genes .
the most familiar case concerning the body as property is that of john moore , a patient who developed hairy cell leukemia and had his spleen removed at the ucla school of medicine in 1976 .
his physician patented certain chemicals in moore 's blood without his knowledge or consent , set up contracts , and sold the rights to a swiss pharmaceutical company to produce drugs from the " mo " cell line .
but the germans , undaunted by it all , simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world .
the black , red , and gold german tricolor adorns the entire country as never before , but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones .
in fact , the flags of many nations fly alongside german .
in berlin , as in other large german cities , taxis sport the flags of their drivers ’ home countries – from angola to saudi arabia .
fans don not just their nations ’ flags , but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries ’ colors .
meanwhile , the epidemic ’s death toll has continued to rise .
to prevent the ebola outbreak from escalating further , the relevant actors – from health workers to government officials – must re-engage with the affected communities and win back their trust .
fortunately , as neighboring rwanda has proven , this is entirely possible .
in 1994 , rwanda endured a brutal genocide , in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed in the space of only 100 days .
thisharrowing experience left behind destroyed property , a failed state , and a traumatized population with little faith in local or international institutions.national basic immunization coverage was less than 30 % .
at the anti-corruption summit in london on may 12 , world leaders – together with representatives from business and civil society – will have a critical opportunity to act on this recognition .
corruption is decried across cultures and throughout history .
it has existed as long as government has ; but , like other crimes , it has grown increasingly sophisticated over the last several decades , with devastating effects on the wellbeing and dignity of countless innocent citizens .
for starters , corruption cripples prospects for development .
when , say , public-procurement fraud is rampant , or royalties for natural resources are stolen at the source , or the private sector is monopolized by a narrow network of cronies , populations are unable to realize their potential .
the protests began when the government tried to enact amnesty legislation that would have overturned the conviction of former prime minister thaksin shinawatra – yingluck ’s brother and the ptp ’s founder , who was overthrown by the military in 2006 – on charges of corruption and abuse of power .
( it also would have superseded the murder charges brought against the democratic party ’s leader , former prime minister abhisit vejjajiva . )
but yingluck ’s subsequent attempt to backtrack on the amnesty measure failed to mollify the opposition .
in fact , the street protests intensified , fueled by a new grievance .
the yingluck government had refused to accept the constitutional court ’s ruling against a bill to change the senate from a half-appointed to a fully elected chamber .
new presidents of the european commission , the european council , and the european central bank will be appointed , and a new high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy will be chosen .
if nationalist euroskeptic parties become the largest group in the european parliament , these appointments could represent an abrupt break from the past .
eu member states are more divided now than ever , even on the most fundamental issues concerning the european project .
the broad pro-european consensus of the past has been replaced by a resurgent nationalism .
moreover , east is increasingly pitted against west , and north against south .
freetown , sierra leone – donors like the world bank and the world health organization often urge developing countries to invest in national health systems .
but while rushing to construct clinics and other medical facilities in even the remotest regions may seem like a straightforward approach to ensuring universal health coverage , that has not turned out to be true .
the recent ebola epidemic in west africa highlighted the urgent need for stronger , more efficient , and more resilient health-care systems in developing countries .
but when countries rush to build more clinics , the resulting facilities tend to be hastily constructed and lacking in the equipment , supplies , and staff needed to deliver vital health services effectively .
in my frequent visits to rural areas of my native sierra leone , i have seen more than a few health facilities that communities could do without .
to be sure , if wilson were alive today , he might agree with trump on some issues , though his proposed solutions would be very different .
for example , wilson would probably concur with trump that the level of openness in global markets today is excessive .
it is indeed problematic that us banks and businesses can export capital , technology , and jobs as they please , with little or no regard for the domestic costs .
but wilson ’s solution would likely focus on developing and implementing improved regulations through a multilateral process dominated by democracies .
likewise , he would probably advocate a fiscal policy aimed at advancing the common good , with higher taxes on the wealthiest companies and households funding , say , infrastructure development , quality education , and universal health care .
but in march 2010 , in a move i believe was key to our subsequent growth , i announced “ englishnization , ” a plan to make english our corporate language within two years .
the goal was to lay the groundwork for global expansion in an industry that competes aggressively for internet-savvy talent .
when i announced englishnization , only 10 % of our workforce was proficient in english .
unsurprisingly , some on my team were apprehensive ; others , especially those outside the firm , thought i was a little crazy .
but , just seven years later , titans of corporate japan are seeking our advice in how to build a global brand headquartered in the japanese capital .
but that would only further weaken the banks ’ credit portfolios at a time when european regulators are desperate to strengthen them .
the ecb ’s decision to provide the banks with unlimited liquidity does not solve governments ’ debt problems , nor is that its intent .
but it at least prevents the debt problem from creating banking problems , which , in turn , worsen the debt problem without end .
europe ’s second vicious spiral runs from fiscal consolidation to slow growth and back to fiscal consolidation .
tax increases and cuts in public spending are still needed ; there is no avoiding this reality .
add economics to this recipe as well .
price regulations and other ill-considered features of european policy contribute to the fact that 60 % of the world 's new drugs are developed in the us , compared to 40 % only ten years ago .
this sterility and inertia make europe less and less interesting for americans .
so american eyes are turning elsewhere : to china with its 1.3 billion people and an economy growing at 8-10 % , year in and year out , and to india , with its 1.1 billion people and 6 % annual growth .
indeed , india now has some of the world 's best engineers , it technicians and medical professionals .
but they will probably die a lot faster if we suddenly contact them , bringing with us modern pathogens against which they have no antibodies .
these tribes might be isolated , but their demise will have serious consequences .
with their reverence for – and understanding of – nature , such groups serve as the world ’s environmental sentinels , safeguarding 80 % of global diversity and playing a critical role in climate change mitigation and adaptation .
when the devastating 2004 indian ocean tsunami struck , more than a quarter-million people died across 14 countries , but the two isolated andaman tribes , which rely on traditional warning systems , suffered no known casualties .
but , as bolsonaro ’s promises underscore , indigenous societies have been pitted directly against loggers , miners , crop planters , ranchers , oil drillers , hunters , and other interlopers .
in my former professional roles , i witnessed as few others did the entry of poland and hungary into the euroatlantic institutions .
i saw firsthand the eagerness and hope of their peoples at that momentous time .
that is why it is so hard for me to understand their position today .
of course , it is not unreasonable that poland and hungary , whose sovereignty was largely usurped by the soviet union , are particularly sensitive to external efforts to shape their decision-making and have a stronger sense of national identity than other eu countries .
but rejecting the eu will not insulate them from the uncertainty resulting from globalization .
no particular country or group created international maritime law as it now exists .
it is the product of humankind ’s collective wisdom , cultivated over a great many years for the wellbeing of all .
today , many benefits for humanity depend on the seas from the pacific to the indian oceans remaining fully open .
but what , exactly , does that mean ?
if we distill the spirit that we have infused into international law over the ages and reformulate it as three principles , the rule of law at sea becomes a matter of common sense .
when perpetrators of sexual violence are called to account in high-profile settings , such as the un , it becomes difficult for individual states to ignore activists ’ demands .
of course , effective solutions must consider local context .
sexual violence can take many forms ; understanding its possible purpose can help predict and prevent its use .
for example , armed groups that use force as a recruiting tool are more likely to commit egregious forms of sexual violence than groups that recruit through other means .
moreover , people living in the shadow of armed groups with genocidal goals have a higher risk of being targeted by sexualized violence – such as forced pregnancies .
because an enlarged union will become a reality in just two months , it is imperative to develop concepts for cultural understanding that contribute to the successful integration of the new members .
some values , long espoused by the union , should be relatively easy to convey .
a decade ago , with the maastricht treaty , eu members agreed to respect the history , culture , and traditions of all of their constituent peoples .
the draft constitution that recently failed to gain acceptance in the first round of negotiations not only promises to respect cultural heritage ; it obliges the union actively to protect , maintain , and develop the wealth of europe 's cultural and linguistic diversity .
but europe can succeed in this task only if its various constituent cultures do not seal themselves off from one another .
if successfully implemented , this agenda is likely to reverse global savings and consumption patterns that have underpinned large imbalances in recent years .
china is responsible for the savings side , while the us disproportionately accounts for the consumption side , ultimately turning the chinese into america ’s creditors .
of course , global savings and consumption patterns have undergone significant change since the financial crisis , with both the west and china trying to restore internal equilibrium .
doubling average household income by 2020 – the target set at the chinese communist party ’s 18th congress in november – is likely to release 64 trillion renminbi ( $ 10.3 trillion ) in purchasing power , with china ’s huge internal market gradually becoming a new long-term driver of domestic and international growth .
this model presupposes that china will develop domestic capital , rather than simply relying on foreign investment .
i understand reding ’s reticence – and her frustration .
i do n’t like quotas either ; they run counter to my belief in meritocracy .
but , when one considers the obstacles to achieving the meritocratic ideal , it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily mandated .
after all , four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in europe as well as the us are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions – no matter how much “ soft pressure ” is put upon them .
when women do break through to the summit of corporate power – as , for example , sheryl sandberg recently did at facebook – they garner massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule .
new delhi – in 2009 , when i competed in india ’s last parliamentary election , i was something of a rarity .
i was not a professional politician .
by contrast , all of the other candidates in my constituency – indeed , most of the contenders across the country – had devoted their entire lives to politics , many since their student days .
i was not born into a political family ; i had no seat or political fiefdom to inherit ; and i had entered the race without a political “ godfather . ”
i had not even lived in india for decades , having spent my adult life working abroad for the united nations .
but , in the end , the experiment failed .
the fdp abandoned the talks out of frustration that , as its leader christian lindner put it , “ the four discussion partners have no common vision for modernization of the country or common basis of trust . ”
even without a jamaica coalition , germany still has a stable liberal majority in the bundestag .
the same can not be said for the rest of the eu , where almost every other member state is now a “ 50-50 society ” : half cosmopolitan , half communitarian .
in these countries , the government at any given time represents whichever side won the latest round in an ongoing culture war .
for starters , all countries need to define the crime of online child trafficking and incorporate it into their national penal codes , along with tough punishments for violators .
all recruitment activities , advertising , and financial transactions associated with online child trafficking should also be criminalized .
raising awareness about the issue is also crucial – especially in developing countries , where illiteracy , poverty , and a lack of age-appropriate sex education in schools can leave children even more vulnerable .
parents must build bridges of trust so that their children feel able to open up about their problems .
faith leaders , too , should educate and sensitize their followers in this regard .
moreover , communities need to increase access to contraceptives and other sexual-health services ; one way to do this would be to revive or establish youth-friendly spaces and centers where information can be shared .
these spaces should be open after school and on weekends , staffed by knowledgeable , sympathetic adults .
special attention must be devoted to rural regions and people with special needs , an often-overlooked segment of the youth population .
these reforms are essential to improve the life prospects of guyana ’s young people .
if more teenagers had access to sex education and contraception , fewer girls would have their lives interrupted by pregnancy .
many are low-income workers who would otherwise be unemployed .
this suggests that stronger economic – and , thus , employment – growth would reduce the number of workers engaged in independent work .
but , regardless of macroeconomic conditions , independent work is likely to account for a rising share of work in the long run , owing to technological advances and individual preferences .
while digital platforms for independent work are still in the early stages of their development , and are being used by only 15 % of independent workers , they are proliferating and expanding rapidly .
mckinsey estimates that 30-45 % of the working-age population would prefer to earn an income , whether primary or secondary , from independent work .
the demand for the abolition of censorship was one of the first political slogans of the polish march ‘ 68 .
demands for freedom of assembly and the right to organize followed .
crucially , the protesters did not demand free elections .
in this they were realists , but they did demand a measure of civic control over the authorities , both in the political and the economic sphere .
one slogan was “ no bread without freedom . ”
new haven – in what could well be a final act of desperation , central banks are abdicating effective control of the economies they have been entrusted to manage .
first came zero interest rates , then quantitative easing , and now negative interest rates – one futile attempt begetting another .
just as the first two gambits failed to gain meaningful economic traction in chronically weak recoveries , the shift to negative rates will only compound the risks of financial instability and set the stage for the next crisis .
the adoption of negative interest rates – initially launched in europe in 2014 and now embraced in japan – represents a major turning point for central banking .
previously , emphasis had been placed on boosting aggregate demand – primarily by lowering the cost of borrowing , but also by spurring wealth effects from appreciating financial assets .
as a result , demand now falls short of any binding constraint .
indeed , the price of permits fell below three euros a ton in april 2013 , rendering the emissions-trading market almost irrelevant .
this , in turn , has encouraged greater reliance on highly polluting coal – the worst energy source , from the standpoint of global warming .
that would not have happened if the price mechanism still underpinned climate-change policy .
moreover , the eu ’s renewables policy has also proved to be ruinously expensive .
the task facing the imf is formidable .
it will , of course , be important for the fund to focus on global imbalances , not bilateral imbalances .
in a multilateral trading system , large bilateral trade deficits are often balanced by bilateral surpluses with other countries .
china might want oil from the middle east , but those in the middle east – with so much wealth concentrated in so few hands – might be more interested in gucci handbags than in china ’s mass-produced goods .
so china can have a trade deficit with the middle east and a trade surplus with the us , but these bilateral balances indicate nothing about china ’s overall contribution to global imbalances .
asked about their feelings the previous day , the majority of americans ( 55 % ) in 2018 said they had experienced stress during a lot of the day , nearly half ( 45 % ) said they felt worried a lot , and more than one in five ( 22 % ) said they felt anger a lot . ”
stress , worry , and anger all hit ten-year us highs in 2018 .
the us was the seventh-most stressed population in the world in 2018 , less stressed than greece , the philippines , and iran , but more stressed than uganda , turkey , and venezuela .
these stress measures are consistent with another notable finding : americans ’ self-reported happiness also declined in 2018 .
asked by gallup how they would rate their life on a scale from zero ( worst life ) to ten ( best life ) , americans in 2018 responded with an average of 6.9 , down from 7.0 in 2017 , and 7.3 during 2006-2008 .
a written code – emphasizing the commercial benefits of ethical business conduct , and the negative consequences of falling short – is part of that effort and may help preserve and strengthen a culture ; but a code alone is not enough .
constant reminders and repetition are essential .
employees must understand instinctively what may be done and what should never be done .
they must internalize a culture that values strict adherence to high ethical standards of conduct .
to that end , banks should make their values and culture integral to their hiring , firing , and promotion decisions .
islamabad – one hundred years ago , women in the united kingdom gained the right to vote , and today , most women in the developed world are enfranchised .
but in many developing countries , the resistance that british suffragettes faced a century ago , rooted in misogyny , persists .
this is certainly true in pakistan , where the general election set for july 25 provides an ideal opportunity to advocate for change .
at first glance , pakistan seems progressive .
the law has permitted women to vote since 1956 , almost a decade after independence from britain .
in some cases , the outcome has been unexpected : some lending rates have actually increased .
it should have been apparent that most central banks ’ pre-crisis models – both the formal models and the mental models that guide policymakers ’ thinking – were badly wrong .
none predicted the crisis ; and in very few of these economies has a semblance of full employment been restored .
the ecb famously raised interest rates twice in 2011 , just as the euro crisis was worsening and unemployment was increasing to double-digit levels , bringing deflation ever closer .
they continued to use the old discredited models , perhaps slightly modified .
but mao ’s death did at least end the era of caesarism in china .
because he had no son to succeed him , mao appointed a five-person politburo to do the job .
its members , which included his nephew , mao yuanxin , his mistress , zhang yufeng , and jiang qing , his last wife – were as incompetent at governing as kim , but , following the disaster of the cultural revolution , antagonism to them in the military and other state institutions was too widespread for them to last .
they , and the gang of four ( of which jiang qing was a member ) , were soon ousted .
china ’s transit from caesarism to despotism , and then from marxism to capitalism , has been fortunate for china ’s citizens .
we in ukraine learned this truth from harsh experience in the communist era .
although communism could , every now and then , coexist with private property , and sometimes with private enterprise , it could never coexist with civil society .
the most fateful attack to accompany the installation of any dictatorship is an attack on civil society .
in ukraine , freedom of speech was , on communism ’s fall , restored overnight .
but reviving civil society – the many mutually complementary ways in which citizens participate in public life – is a complicated task , as the peoples of egypt and tunisia will soon find out .
then , imagine that us intelligence agencies confirmed that an act of aggression was indeed underway , despite putin ’s denials .
finally , imagine how trump might respond .
would he call putin to ask what ’s going on ?
and would putin make another “ incredible offer ” to help us investigators get to the bottom of things ?
even more to the point : would trump quickly invoke the principle of collective defense under article 5 of the nato treaty ?
but these outside risks do not make the outlook for global growth necessarily grim .
the baseline scenario for the us is still strong growth .
europe ’s growth could be above trend as well , as it continues its long , slow recovery from the debt crisis at the beginning of the decade .
and china ’s economy has been proving doubters wrong for many years .
so 2019 could turn out to be another year of solid global growth .
argued by eugene scalia , the son of us supreme court justice antonin scalia , the case against the sec was won in the us court of appeals , dc circuit , on a technicality – the sec ’s failure to conduct a cost-benefit analysis ahead of time .
this small victory turned into a major defeat for shareholders when the sec , rather than performing such an analysis and re-proposing the rule , chose to stall .
at a conference last december , i asked sec chairwoman mary schapiro when her agency was planning to reintroduce the rule .
i even offered to do the cost-benefit analysis for free .
but she confessed that the sec had many other items on its agenda , and had placed the issue on the back burner – a polite way to say that the sec , like the heroic students in tiananmen square , had surrendered under irresistible pressure .
but these are not normal times .
indeed , the fed ’s monetary policy has not been sufficient to stave off a us recession , albeit one that remains so mild that many doubt whether it qualifies as the real animal .
the european central bank ’s response has been analogous to the fed ’s , but less forceful , with monetary policy easier than the headline inflation rate would suggest is appropriate .
and in western europe , too , gdp is now declining .
in brief , the major central banks on both sides of the atlantic have responded to the financial crisis , but they have not overreacted .
when the opposition tried to challenge these inconsistencies , the eck abruptly declared kibaki the winner .
days later , the eck ’s head publicly acknowledged that kibaki supporters had pressured him to announce the “ results ” immediately , despite the clear evidence of vote rigging .
shockingly , he declared that he did not know who really won .
the eu observers also announced that the election tally had not met basic international standards .
the election is a disaster for kenya , but the response of the international community , led by the us , is no less distressing .
moreover , a host of problems related to risk premiums make such indicators hard to interpret .
unsurprisingly , therefore , surveys of households ’ and firms ’ inflation expectations forecast actual inflation more accurately .
given that the market-based measures currently conflict with most other key economic data as well , little weight should be attached to them .
it is also true that current global trade tensions have hit eurozone manufacturers hard , particularly in germany .
but it is difficult for monetary policymakers to respond to the introduction of trade barriers .
but pharmaceutical companies continue to hold assumptions about the boundaries of pre-competitive collaboration that need to be challenged .
at first sight , it seems counterintuitive that companies would want to share data and potentially give away competitive advantages .
but this presupposes that the possession of such data does indeed imply a competitive advantage , and that a closed operating model is financially sustainable .
drugs that make it to market have to fund the cost of failure of those that did not make it to the market .
as a recent morgan stanley report pointed out , the pharmaceutical industry ’s current success rates are not sufficient to sustain large internal r & d organizations , making the industry ’s current operating model financially non-viable .
although the iranian government could most likely be deterred from using a nuclear weapon , the price of a nuclear iran could well be a regional arms race – a nuclear saudi arabia , possibly followed by turkey and egypt .
nuclear weapons , components , and materials in a region that is already volatile and violent , and that determines the world ’s oil prices , is an appalling scenario .
the market has already taken the measure of the past week ’s tensions , driving up the price of some oil contracts to their highest levels in eight months .
trying to force iran to back down with steadily mounting sanctions has not produced results .
despite the tightening economic noose – the us imposed sanctions on all companies that do business with iran ’s central bank , and the european union plans to impose sanctions on iranian oil exports by the end of january – many nuclear experts now estimate that iran is very close to enriching enough uranium to build a bomb .
this levy , strongly backed by those countries whose financial sectors are in tatters after the crisis , is hard to swallow for eu states that did not intervene to bail out their banks .
the levy is an easy way to spread the political and financial costs of the crisis from some to all eu members .
if applied , bank capital will be scarcer , the flow of credit slower , and bank fees higher in countries with pretty stable financial sectors , simply because others have spent a fortune to support their financial systems – and because the european commission never misses an opportunity to unify rules across the eu .
the same is true , for instance , for the derivatives trading system .
the post-crisis harmonization fervor in this area means that it will now be more costly everywhere in the eu to insure against currency volatility or unexpected changes in interest .
at & t offers scholarships through partner non-profit institutions and provides paid internships for up to 100 graduates .
learnup , a san francisco startup that has attracted funding from some of the biggest venture capital firms in silicon valley , establishes partnerships with employers to offer online training modules that connect job seekers to specific jobs , primarily entry-level positions that do not require college degrees .
employers foot the bill , with the expectation that learnup will help them recruit higher-quality applicants .
and , indeed , once candidates have completed the training , learnup helps them to secure interviews with prospective employers , which already includes several large companies .
the california community college system is already working with learnup to give students access to the skills required to fill available local jobs .
porto – the military coup that has overthrown egypt ’s first democratically elected president and led to the arrests of muslim brotherhood leaders across the country poses an enormous danger not only for egypt ’s democratic transition , but for the democratic hopes of the entire arab world as well .
the fact that the coup was undertaken with massive popular support is a sign of the enormous difficulties faced by the muslim brotherhood during its first turn in power .
president mohamed morsi ’s government struggled to address egypt ’s inherited economic and social crises in the face of the enormous public expectations created by the 2011 revolution , whose protagonists sought not only freedom , but also economic development and social justice .
of course , the muslim brotherhood was also a victim of its own mistakes , particularly the failure of morsi and his government to reach out to the secular opposition , elements of which had contributed to his election .
the morsi government seemed incapable of understanding that a slim electoral majority is not enough , especially nowadays .
paris – earlier this month , the trial of pascal simbikangwa , accused of complicity in the genocide in rwanda , in which 800,000 people were killed between april and july 1994 , began in paris .
unfortunately , mass killings in africa continue .
in south sudan , africa ’s newest state , massacres of civilians are still taking place , particularly around the city of bor .
and french military intervention in the central african republic has not put an end to severe inter-communal violence there .
yet , paradoxically , even as such episodes continue to occur in africa , perhaps on a larger scale than anywhere else in the world , the continent has also become a beacon of hope .
moreover , with growing concerns about the sustainability of us fiscal policy , the euro has a huge opportunity to play a significantly larger role as a reserve currency .
one shudders to think what will happen if europe does not pull out of its current funk .
certainly , europe would lose traction as a badly needed counterweight to the us in world economic policy .
europeans may not mind this right now ( one sees more obama t-shirts in europe than in the us ) , but they might not be so happy if a george bush iii comes along .
fortunately , europeans will probably not wait so long to start moving ahead again .
that implies that it was not appropriate to focus on growth until the deflation gap narrowed considerably – that is , until now .
the third arrow is not a traditional industrial-policy-based approach .
on the contrary , it emphasizes reform of the labor market , deregulation , and a reduction in the corporate-tax rate .
a key component of abe ’s growth strategy is to expand the workforce – a major challenge , given that japanese society is aging rapidly .
one logical solution would be to integrate more foreign labor into the japanese economy .
what is certain is that the vacuum left by sharon ’s departure from politics is all the more striking in view of the images of chaos emerging from the gaza that israel has vacated , and the collapse of the palestinian authority before our eyes .
nor will the emergence of another providential figure come easily .
not all exceptional periods create their bonapartes , and this is probably a good thing , for exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all problems have solutions , which is far from true .
the natural course of history in the most optimistic sense is progress “ at the margin , ” but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect equally rapid progress in human affairs .
many of us believe that such an impossible wager can be fulfilled only by a providential man , with all the hopes – and dangers – that this entails .
so , while the cameron government ’s support for deeper eurozone integration is welcome , the eurozone can not and will not be shaped from outside and according to british interests .
the uk is not in a position to block the other eu member states from deeper integration , given most other member states ’ political will to move forward .
indeed , last year ’s negotiations on the “ fiscal compact ” should already have demonstrated to cameron the difficulty of exercising the so-called national veto .
still , the uk has played a leading role in designing key eu policies , including measures concerning the single market , overseas development aid , trade , and climate change .
uk leadership in these areas has been highly appreciated – and would be sorely missed should the british decide to leave .
but they will fault the us for not comprehending the larger war .
it is already clear that the obama administration did n’t know what it was bargaining for when , without thinking about what would come next , it called in 2011 for assad ’s removal .
in july of that year , robert s. ford , the us ambassador to syria , was sent to the sunni town of hama , where assad ’s father had ordered a massacre 30 years earlier .
according to the state department at the time , the point of the visit was to “ [ express ] our deep support for the right of the syrian people to assemble peacefully and to express themselves . ”
did the administration really not foresee that assad – like his father before him – would react to a popular uprising with violence ?
beijing – after years of intervening to manage the renminbi ’s exchange rate , china ’s central bank , the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) , is under pressure to float the currency .
but striking the right balance between loosening its grip on the exchange rate and maintaining monetary stability will not be easy .
all economics students learn the mundell-fleming model , according to which an economy can not maintain a fixed exchange rate , free capital movement , and an independent monetary policy simultaneously .
if a country with a fixed exchange rate and an open capital account tightens monetary policy , in order to contain inflation , the rise in domestic interest rates will give market participants an incentive to borrow foreign currencies and convert them into the domestic currency for investment in domestic assets .
the resulting capital inflows , if persistent , would generate upward pressure on the currency , forcing the central bank , in a bid to maintain exchange-rate stability , to intervene by selling domestic currency , especially for us dollars , until interest rates and the money supply have returned to their original levels .
us presidential candidate hillary clinton has a more targeted proposal : a 15 % tax credit for profits that companies distribute to workers over two years .
by providing temporary tax relief , the scheme would help companies offset the administrative costs of establishing a profit-sharing program .
in order to limit costs and prevent abuse , profits totaling more than 10 % on top of an employee ’s wage would be excluded ; the overall amount offered to individual firms would be capped ; and safeguards against the substitution of profit sharing for wages , raises , and other benefits would be established .
the tax credit could also foster changes in corporate culture , by spurring board-level discussions not only of the benefits of profit sharing , but also of sharing information and decision-making authority with employees .
the stagnant incomes of the majority of us workers are undermining economic growth on the demand side ( by discouraging household consumption ) and on the supply side ( through adverse effects on educational opportunity , human-capital development , and innovation ) .
most russians do not see a connection between the prosecution of key figures and the credibility of the authorities .
on the contrary , people seem to identify with putin ’s message that the establishment is finally tackling corruption .
but it is the message to russia ’s shaken elites that is more relevant .
and that message is straightforward : no one is safe from prosecution , even if – like abyzov and ishayev – they have retired from public service and no longer have any influence .
moreover , selective repression has become harsher .
it also supported a successor to the commission , the high level expert group on the measurement of economic performance and social progress .
last week , at the oecd ’s sixth world forum on statistics , knowledge , and policy in incheon , south korea , the group issued its report , beyond gdp : measuring what counts for economic and social performance .
the new report highlights several topics , like trust and insecurity , which had been only briefly addressed by mismeasuring our lives , and explores several others , like inequality and sustainability , more deeply .
and it explains how inadequate metrics have led to deficient policies in many areas .
better indicators would have revealed the highly negative and possibly long-lasting effects of the deep post-2008 downturn on productivity and wellbeing , in which case policymakers might not have been so enamored of austerity , which lowered fiscal deficits , but reduced national wealth , properly measured , even more .
seventy-three years ago , john maynard keynes thought about the reform and regulation of financial markets from the perspective of the first three purposes and found himself “ moved toward ... mak [ ing ] the purchase of an investment permanent and indissoluble , like marriage ... ”
but he immediately drew back : the fact “ that each individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is ‘ liquid ’ ( though this can not be true for all investors collectively ) calms his nerves and makes him much more willing to run a risk ... ”
moreover , for keynes , “ [ t ] he game of professional investment is intolerably boring and over-exacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct ; whilst he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll ... ”
it is for these reasons that we have seemed frozen for the past generation or two whenever we have contemplated reforming our system of financial regulation .
and it is why , even in the face of a severe financial crisis , we remain frozen today .
perhaps the most outrageous example is america ’s $ 0.54 per gallon import tariff on ethanol , whereas there is no tariff on oil , and only a $ 0.5 per gallon tax on gasoline .
this contrasts with the $ 0.51 per gallon subsidy that us companies ( a huge portion of which goes to a single firm ) receive on ethanol .
thus , foreign producers ca n’t compete unless their costs are $ 1.05 per gallon lower than those of american producers .
the huge subsidies have meant that the us has become the largest producer of ethanol in the world .
yet , despite this huge advantage , some foreign firms can still make it in the american market .
the results have not only created a conflict between us federal law and state legislation , but also signal a shift in attitudes not dissimilar to that concerning same-sex marriage .
just as important , however , was president barack obama ’s reaction to the colorado and washington votes – both states that he won easily in his re-election bid .
the legal and political challenges implied are no minor matter : marijuana remains an illicit substance under us federal law and international conventions that america has adopted .
on other issues – notably immigration – obama rejects claims of states ’ rights and insists on federal authority .
moreover , the topic remains highly sensitive : while public-opinion polls in 2012 indicate for the first time a small majority in favor of legalization , opponents remain vehement .
the result has been disastrous , as ethnic rivalries sharpened .
whatever else is said about such french-backed authoritarian regimes , hindsight leaves no doubt about the benefits of the social stability seen in the ivory coast during the period until the 1980 ’s , when france remained paternalistically engaged with its former colony .
the political upheavals of 1999-2000 resulted in a new “ democratic ” constitution that became an invitation to civil war .
regional and religious tensions had been growing since houphouet ’s death and were aggravated by the new constitution , which enshrined ethnic discrimination .
about four million northerners were denied political participation or land ownership on the grounds that they were descendants of migrants from neighboring countries .
these are highly educated people who know that knowledge is power , have a clear agenda , and are taking advantage of the fact that education in the european union is the responsibility of national governments , not brussels-based institutions .
these governments want to establish an educational system according to which the state alone decides which fields of research are necessary and socially important .
in the long run , they probably also want the state to grant political loyalists the right to produce and transfer knowledge .
in other words , access to knowledge will cease to be a civil right .
political trustworthiness will determine who can teach and study what about a country and its past .
dubai – globalization , as many have recently noted , is in retreat .
despite all of its undeniable benefits , it has spawned problems of governance and management that have exposed the inadequacy of national governments and international institutions .
this has left people everywhere , rich and poor alike , struggling to cope with problems – from failed states to failed banks , from over-fishing to under-employment , from climate change to economic stagnation – to which globalization has contributed but can not address effectively .
fragile institutions have given rise to a political backlash and the danger of disaster on many fronts .
mark leonard , director of the european council on foreign relations and vice chair of the world economic forum ’s new global agenda council on geo-economics , has noted that interdependence , formerly an economic boon , has now become a threat as well .
london – for two decades , chinese diplomacy has been guided by the concept of the country ’s “ peaceful rise . ”
today , however , china needs a new strategic doctrine , because the most remarkable aspect of sri lanka ’s recent victory over the tamil tigers is not its overwhelming nature , but the fact that china provided president mahinda rajapaska with both the military supplies and diplomatic cover he needed to prosecute the war .
without that chinese backing , rajapaska ’s government would have had neither the wherewithal nor the will to ignore world opinion in its offensive against the tigers .
so , not only has china become central to every aspect of the global financial and economic system , it has now demonstrated its strategic effectiveness in a region traditionally outside its orbit .
on sri lanka ’s beachfront battlefields , china ’s “ peaceful rise ” was completed .
should the euro break up and the gipsic countries default , germany alone would lose about € 545 billion euros , nearly half of the aggregate sum mentioned , since the bundesbank has carried out most of the net payments on behalf of the gipsic countries that are reflected in the target balances .
germany has the biggest exposure by far among the countries rescuing the eurozone ’s crisis-stricken countries , and thus helps to mitigate austerity more than any other country .
george soros underestimates the risks that debt mutualisation would pose for the future of the eurozone .
when alexander hamilton , the first us finance minister , mutualised state debts in 1791 , he thought this would cement the new american nation .
but the mutualisation of debt gave rise to huge moral hazard effects , inducing the states to borrow excessively .
hong kong – looking back on 2016 , there may not seem to be much to celebrate .
in terms of global health alone , the year appeared to be one of unrelenting tragedy .
beyond stories of hospitals in conflict zones being bombed , the zika virus emerged as a growing threat .
there was also the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant microbes , or “ superbugs , ” the continued revival of yellow fever , and the reemergence of polio in nigeria , which had previously been declared polio-free .
hopes for a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine were dashed .
when it comes to ensuring equity in banking , these precedents and existing institutions point the way forward .
history also shows us that financial exclusion is a persistent problem whenever universal service requirements are absent .
during the new deal era , regulators included the functional equivalent of such a requirement in charters for banks and thrifts .
but these mandates were removed during the wave of deregulation in the 1980s , and banks quickly began to move away from low-cost financial services , and toward high-profit activities .
this dynamic can be seen in the trend toward bank consolidation and branch closings , which has accelerated since the 2008 financial crisis and reduced access to services in low-income communities .
after all , the israeli government not only permitted the supposedly unapproved outposts to exist , but also supplied them with water , electricity , internet , and military protection .
this was n’t lost on all us leaders .
in april 2014 , then-us secretary of state john kerry told the us congress that direct talks between israel and palestine went “ poof ” when israel announced 700 new housing units for israelis in the west bank .
by december 2016 , obama was allowing the un security council to vote on that trump-derided resolution declaring israel ’s settlement construction a “ major obstacle ” to a two-state solution .
it is not difficult to imagine what palestinian negotiators must have felt as they drove by the massive israeli settlements on territory that they were working to include in an independent state .
new haven : across europe and america , men in black tie and women in kenzo and armani gowns are once more summer pilgrims to places like bayreuth , glyndebourne , and glimmerglass .
once again , too , state coffers are tapped to support these privileged retreats .
perhaps , then , it is also time to ask once again a basic question : should the state continue to ladle out generous subsidies for such an elite activity ?
consider a thing of indisputable beauty and spiritual depth : the roman catholic high mass .
does its grandeur mean that the state should subsidize it ?
so the key characteristic of foreign policy integration is that governments can not know in advance what they are letting themselves in for .
in the case of defence and warfare , unpredictability includes the possibility of young men dying in action .
it is not surprising , therefore , that foreign policy integration has not made much progress .
this contrast underlines the fact that the great achievements of eu integration have taken place in that no-man ’s - land which lies between complete national independence and a complete loss of sovereignty in a federation .
but foreign policy , as we have known it , is essentially a manifestation of the nation state or of the superpower .
we are facing a shortfall of $ 100 million for the new school year .
without additional support from the international community , our vision will not be realized – despite strong political will and rigorous planning .
lebanon often struggles to attract funding because of its status as a middle-income country , but this label is misleading , as it does not take into account serious structural weaknesses that pre-date the syrian crisis or the huge proportion of the resident population composed of refugees from syria , palestine , and iraq living in abject poverty .
one thing i hope will become clear at the oslo education summit is the need to help middle-income countries affected by fragility and conflict .
i am thankful to the donors who have been with us from the beginning , but we now need additional international support .
what does this tell us about human nature , and our ability to live either prudently or ethically ?
part of the problem , of course , is that we make resolutions to do only things that we are not otherwise likely to do .
only an anorexic would resolve to eat ice cream at least once a week , and only a workaholic would resolve to spend more time in front of the television .
so we use the occasion of the new year to try to change behavior that may be the most difficult to change .
that makes failure a distinct possibility .
a second conclusion to be drawn from the current situation is that the fed has now overestimated the strength of the us economy for 11 consecutive years .
elementary mathematics dictates that credible forecasts should at least overestimate half the time and undershoot half the time .
if each year of fed forecasting were a coin toss , we would now have had eleven heads in a row , and zero tails .
the odds of that happening are one in 2,048 .
the fed clearly needs to take a deep look at its forecasting methodology and policymaking processes .
any study seeking to determine whether a psychiatric disorder is over-diagnosed will find that some patients with the condition do not have it upon re-interview .
such is the nature of the imperfect reliability of psychiatric diagnosis .
the question , then , is not whether some patients previously given a diagnosis do not seem to have it upon re-interview , but rather how many .
how high the percentage should be before claiming over-diagnosis is a significant problem and a value judgment .
but we think that an over-diagnosis rate of more than 50 % crosses the clinical significance threshold .
in many of the previous banking crises , it was a country or a region that was hit hard ( argentina , japan , etc. ) .
this time , virtually every economy is suffering substantially and the banking crisis is global .
policymakers will continue to throw whatever ammunition they can find at the problem , but it will take time for the deleveraging from the boom to run its course .
at times of serious economic distress , policymakers thrash about seeking solutions , and some people lose confidence in the economic system itself .
indeed , in the great depression of the 1930 ’s , it was common for western intellectuals to turn to communism and central planning as a hoped-for panacea .
washington , dc – steve bannon ’s extensive travels in europe this year have not drawn as much attention as they should have , given that he is the key theoretician of us president donald trump ’s signature brand of nationalism .
bannon now wants to build a federation of nationalist parties in europe .
and yet , one wonders how an “ america first ” ideologue can pursue his political project anywhere other than in america .
by joining forces with the french far-right leader marine le pen – herself an open supporter of russian president vladimir putin – bannon seems to have in mind a new type of “ neo-nationalist international . ”
as more countries transform themselves into “ nationalist autocracies ” and “ illiberal democracies ” under strongman rule , nationalism has become an ideological common denominator .
one famous incident in the late eighteenth century was lord macartney ’s british mission to the imperial court of china .
macartney refused to conform to chinese imperial protocol by declining to kowtow to the emperor , because he was not required to do the same to his own sovereign .
this , too , was very much a case of “ keeping face ” : the chinese expected tribute ; the british lord insisted on the equal status of his king .
as a result , the mission broke down .
diplomatic immunity from local prosecution was an idea that sprang directly from another incident , almost a century earlier , involving the arrest of a russian aristocrat , andrey matveyev , who represented peter the great in london .
if not , the loss in the price of the bond would more than wipe out the extra interest that he earned , even if rates remain unchanged for five years .
here is how the arithmetic works for an investor who rolls over ten-year bonds for the next five years , thus earning 2 % more each year than he would by investing in treasury bills or bank deposits .
assume that the interest rate on ten-year bonds remains unchanged for the next five years and then rises from 2 % to 5 % .
during those five years , the investor earns an additional 2 % each year , for a cumulative gain of 10 % .
but when the interest rate on a ten-year bond rises to 5 % , the bond ’s price falls from $ 100 to $ 69 .
only the world ’s political and economic heavyweights , the main industrialized countries that remain by far the biggest consumers of hydrocarbons , can initiate change on a global scale .
change must begin in the transport sector , which accounts for more than half of current oil consumption – a share that is likely to rise in the future .
the g-8 countries should therefore agree to no longer license any new , oil-powered cars from 2025 onwards .
this decision would not be directed against individual mobility , but against the dissipation of a scarce resource that is more urgently needed to produce synthetic materials .
political leaders should not privilege any particular technology .
ithaca – us president-elect donald trump has once again managed to turn facts on their head .
as part of a broader effort to take china to task for supposedly “ raping ” the united states economy through unfair trade policy , he has now renewed his accusation that the country manipulates its currency in order to gain an advantage for its exports .
such statements are as dangerous as they are unmoored from reality .
make no mistake : trump ’s accusation of chinese currency manipulation is not supported by the facts .
on the contrary , for the last two and a half years , the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) has been intervening in currency markets for the opposite purpose : to prevent the renminbi ’s value from falling too sharply against the dollar .
new delhi – late last month , when two indian states and the national capital were held to ransom by rioting mobs protesting their spiritual leader ’s conviction on two counts of raping minor girls , many indians found themselves confronting several painful truths about their country .
the leader who spurred these protests is gurmeet singh , one of the more prominent of several “ godmen , ” or self-proclaimed spiritual leaders , who flourish across india .
the flamboyant , jewelry-bedecked singh calls himself baba gurmeet ram rahim singh insan – a compound of hindu , muslim , and sikh names , followed by the word for “ human ” in hindi , punjabi , and urdu .
and he has a reputation for sexually exploiting his female followers .
in 2002 , two of those followers mustered the courage to press charges .
by contrast , some american policymakers continue to believe that iran would abandon its enrichment program if only the european union imposed unilateral sanctions .
but a clear-headed analysis of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’s behavior indicates that eu sanctions would lead to more trade diversion , with china , russia , turkey , or dubai benefiting from reduced levels of european exports to iran .
of course , some imports would become more expensive for iran , but the economic effect of such sanctions would remain limited .
politically , ahmadinejad certainly would not miss the chance to exploit unilateral measures for propaganda purposes – claiming that iran has a conflict not with the international community , but with imperialist states intent on depriving his country of technological progress .
for these reasons , europeans favor a new security council resolution , even if its measures are weaker than what the united states or the eu could impose unilaterally .
no one could be more identified with the political elite than abe , the grandson of a wartime cabinet minister and later prime minister , and son of a foreign minister .
and yet , he shares right-wing populists ’ hostility to liberal academics , journalists , and intellectuals .
postwar japanese democracy was influenced in the 1950 and 1960s by an intellectual elite that consciously sought to distance japan from its wartime nationalism .
abe and his allies are trying to quash that influence .
his efforts to revise japan ’s pacifist constitution , restore pride in its wartime record , and discredit “ elitist ” mainstream media , such as the left-of-center newspaper asahi shimbun , have earned him the praise of donald trump ’s former strategist , stephen bannon , who called abe a “ trump before trump . ”
ensuring high-quality output and local consumers ’ loyalty requires keeping their workforces happy and maintaining a positive public image .
by contrast , african countries often see the worst sides of multinationals : energy , mineral , and precious metal companies go where resources are , not where it ’s pleasant to work .
as one former mining manager in the region told me , “ the aim was always simple : get the assets out of the ground and out of the country as cheaply and with as little fuss as possible . ”
because the customer is abroad , and there is little processing to be done in country , why should companies upgrade local skills or otherwise help the host economy ?
but sub-saharan africa ’s potential relationship with global corporations need not be so limited .
the first big city to boom was london , starting around 1996 .
boom mentality spread to los angeles , new york , and sydney around 1997 , to paris in 1998 , to miami , moscow , and shanghai in 2001 , and vancouver around 2002 .
these and other cities have been booming pretty much ever since ; prices in most are up at least 50 % in real terms since 2000 .
this has been a big windfall to homeowners , but has hurt anyone planning to buy .
now growth in home prices is weakening in some of these cities .
the government employs a host of new legal regulations , a shadowy internet police force , and a powerful hardware-based national information filtering system .
control also relies on the demography of internet users , most of whom belong to china 's economic elite and are more likely to adopt the internet as part of a newfound consumer lifestyle than as a tool for political or social revolution .
what is surprising is that the government 's control mechanisms have been largely effective .
but it is also prompting profound social changes that are rooted in a rising rights consciousness within society , something strengthened -- and amplified -- not only by the growth of the economy , but by the rapid spread of the internet .
after two and a half decades of market-oriented economic reform , chinese citizens are increasingly aware of how to protect their economic and social interests by using the language of rights .
this european polity lacks the second crucial element of madison ’s scheme : diversified political representation at the federal level .
individual nation-states , regions , and special-interest groups are represented within the eu .
but , while common european causes arise daily , they have no europe-wide political representation .
no single political party or politician in brussels can claim to represent european citizens ’ associated interests , because none has had to compete for europe-wide public support .
as a result , nationally elected representatives are responsible for making crucial eu-level decisions .
is there anything more , really , that one can ask of a president ?
and yet us presidential campaigns generally neglect discussion of advisers or intellectual influences .
although a president ’s advisers may change , one would think that candidates would acknowledge them , if only to suggest where their own ideas come from ; after all , realistically what they are selling is their ability to judge and manage expertise , not their own ability as economists .
this time , too , however , there was no mention by name of any deep economic thinker , or of any specific economic model .
obama originally had a wonder team of economic advisers , including lawrence summers , christina romer , austan goolsbee , and cass sunstein .
for another , they will have to make their own , distinct contribution .
they can not simply wait for america to move , nor can they always seek to placate washington 's preferences .
in short , they will have to make their own efforts to sustain the common effort .
what this distinct contribution could be is not difficult to define .
after all , only the ingrained habit of playing second fiddle to the us prevents eu members from clearly and loudly distancing themselves from israel 's repressive interferences on the west bank and gaza , even though such a stance would help strengthen the commitment of arab states to the coalition against terrorism as well as provide a useful shove to american diplomacy .
one reason for this is that small numbers of patients make studying illnesses and testing drugs difficult .
as a result , medical professionals often know little about the symptoms and biology of these diseases .
earlier this year , i participated in a rare disease day program in california .
the topic was an obscure but large collection ( more than 70 ) of diseases caused by a specific type of genetic error – one that takes place in the machinery of cells that chemically attaches sugars to proteins and lipids .
little is known about what causes the mutations that give rise to these congenital disorders , and treatments exist for only a few .
markets become rigged , justice becomes transactional , and politicians sell themselves to the highest bidder .
in time , this “ culture of corruption ” will permeate society .
in ukraine , even universities are compromised : degrees are regularly bought and sold .
although corruption is more of a symptom than a cause of ukraine ’s problems , the culture of corruption must be uprooted before conditions can improve .
one might assume that this simply requires a strong state , with the means to root out corrupt politicians and businessmen .
nor should anyone expect a moratorium on settlement expansion .
on the contrary , the settlements offer cheaper housing than is available in israel , and thus resolve one of the main economic problems of the country ’s middle class .
“ red lines ” in israel have a way of mutating into lines drawn in the sand , which are then rendered invisible at the slightest wind .
the new government ’s fragile equilibrium only reinforces this sober interpretation .
in israel , obama will encounter a country that has indeed moved , but not toward a missing center .
as a result , the ratio of tax revenue to total spending this fiscal year has fallen below 50 % for the first time in japan ’s postwar history .
if the government continues on this path , many expect next year ’s budget deficit to widen further .
despite the weakness of japan ’s fiscal position , the market for japanese government bonds ( jgbs ) remains stable , at least for now .
japan had a similar experience in the 1990 ’s , the country ’s so-called “ lost decade . ”
at that time , japan ’s budget deficit soared after the country ’s property bubble burst , causing economic stagnation .
the mugabe regime has committed outrage after outrage .
its catalogue of crimes includes : stealing the 2002 elections that enabled mugabe to hold on to power ; torturing and murdering supporters of the opposition movement for democratic change ; transformation of a fertile , prosperous country once considered africa 's breadbasket into a place where half the population barely survives on foreign food handouts ; and , as exemplified by its attacks on the daily news , the suppression of critical voices .
yet zimbabwe 's neighbors , particularly those in southern africa , have defended president mugabe .
in late august , the heads of state of thirteen members of the southern african development community ( sadc ) , including mugabe and president thabo mbeki of south africa , the leading regional power , met in dar es salaam , tanzania , to consider the challenges before them .
among the 54 paragraphs of the summit final communiqué , two dealt with zimbabwe .
a 2014 pew study found that while only 25 % of respondents were satisfied with the direction of national policy , 60 % were satisfied with governance in their own communities .
and the us constitution allows individual states to function as what judge brandeis called laboratories of democracy by experimenting with innovative policies without putting the rest of the country at risk .
there is a long and rich history of successful experiments .
state and local governments were leaders in establishing public primary and secondary education systems , as well as state colleges and universities .
california , wyoming , and other states allowed women to vote – an example that encouraged passage of the nineteenth amendment ( enfranchising all adult women ) .
should higher nominal ( that is , inflation-driven ) growth replace debt-driven growth ?
europe must aim for sustainable , non-inflationary growth and the creation of competitive jobs .
the current inflation rate of 0.3 % is due to the significant decline in commodity prices and the painful but unavoidable adjustment of costs and prices in the peripheral countries .
only greece currently has a slightly negative inflation rate .
in other words , price stability reigns in the eurozone .
thus , record-high speculative prices have likely caused bunker traders to release inventory , but those releases may have been purchased by speculators who are now active lessees of commercial storage capacity .
the implication is that speculators can drive up prices and increase their inventory holdings even as total commercial inventories remain little changed .
additionally , oil market speculation may have induced “ echo speculation , ” whereby ultimate users buy refined products in advance to protect against future price hikes .
they then take delivery on their premises so that overall refined inventories rise , but that increase is not part of reported commercial inventories .
proving that speculation is responsible for higher prices is always difficult , because it tends to occur against a background of strong fundamentals .
but both states lack the domestic revenues needed to sustain their institutions .
if they wish to survive well into the next century , they will probably need to be subsumed under a union supported by a larger , more powerful , and more established nation-state .
furthermore , the disintegration that the region has already witnessed – and will undoubtedly continue to witness – will reverberate beyond the arab map with the creation of a sovereign kurdish state .
such a state , whether exisiting de facto or with widespread formal recognition , will have an ever-lasting effect on the boundaries of the arab world ( syria and iraq ) and of the wider middle east ( turkey and iran ) .
the arab spring has toppled some regimes , though not others .
we tend to think that new risk-management products , such as novel types of insurance or financial derivatives , will primarily interest the rich , or at least relatively wealthy people .
in fact , new risk-management products are being developed for some of the poorest people in africa , asia , and latin america .
it is important to recognize that the world ’s poorest people are not the same people from year to year .
good fortune and bad fortune alternate randomly , and the poorest people are particularly vulnerable when misfortune – like a hurricane in a fishing village – strikes .
so risk management , by smoothing out bumps in income , can be extremely important in alleviating the effects of poverty .
that disconnect is nothing new ; there have always been tsars and serfs , politburo commissars and proletariat .
that postcommunist boris yeltsin , however , although he sometimes declared allegiance to a hazy collective sense of rossiyane ( citizens of russia ) , deprived – or freed , it ’s a matter of opinion – russians of all collective life ; both the real life of shared hardship and the imaginary half-life of communist solidarity .
today everyone deals with life and hardship individually ( a new word in our everyday vocabulary ) regardless of any kremlin desire to make life uniform .
indeed , even russian uniformity is different nowadays .
in novgorod i saw lukoil ( one of russia ’s big private oil companies ) petrol stations .
greater international cooperation would maximize immigration ’s economic benefits .
but , despite the potential benefits of cooperation in controlling illegal immigration , most countries , including the us and the uk , seek to reform their immigration laws unilaterally .
they view cooperation as infeasible , given the natural competition between destination and source countries for the most productive workers .
a new system , in which “ reversible bonds ” replaced quotas and desirability screenings , would diminish such competition , while mitigating the risks to destination and source countries .
reversible bonds would act as an insurance mechanism for both sides , shielding destination countries from the expense of fiscally motivated immigration and protecting source countries from the costs associated with the loss of talented workers .
every downturn eventually comes to an end .
the mark of a good policy is that it succeeds in making the downturn shallower and shorter than it otherwise would have been .
the mark of the austerity policies that many governments embraced is that they made the downturn far deeper and longer than was necessary , with long-lasting consequences .
real ( inflation-adjusted ) gdp per capita is lower in most of the north atlantic than it was in 2007 ; in greece , the economy has shrunk by an estimated 23 % .
germany , the top-performing european country , has recorded miserly 0.7 % average annual growth over the last six years .
twenty-five years ago , poland 's people were stunned by the choice of their compatriot , cardinal karol wojtyla of cracow , as pope .
some were frightened , others wept with joy .
here , said a prominent writer , was " poland 's second baptism . "
but even in our euphoria , we did not expect how much the new pope would change not only poland , but the world .
his first return visit to his native country soon afterwards showed to all the world the new pope 's power .
although the hong kong courts surely could have dealt with the issue themselves – under the “ one country , two systems ” framework , hong kong is assured an independent court system , in addition to the right to elect its own legislature – an enraged china intervened .
restraint is not , after all , a leninist virtue .
in an extraordinary move , china ’s national people ’s congress standing committee stepped in to “ clarify ” article 104 of the basic law , declaring that all oaths taken by office-holders must be “ solemn , accurate , complete , and sincere . ”
yau and leung were barred from taking their seats in the legislative council .
to most hong kong lawyers , the display of political authority did not represent simply a reinterpretation of old rules , but a move toward making new ones .
prodded by groups like the workers rights consortium and the ethical trading initiative , some corporations promise to pay living wages , open their factories to monitors , and even provide employees a voice in the workplace .
reebok , the multinational sportswear firm , advertises its corporate code as being " based on the core principles " of the un 's universal declaration of human rights .
the company markets its soccer balls and other goods with a " guaranteed : manufactured without child labor " label .
but sensitivity to human rights has done nothing to staunch trade unionism 's worldwide decline .
the international labor organization reports that unions are in retreat in most nations .
the united states has already taken the next logical step .
the securities and exchange commission requires companies that use tantalum , tin , gold or tungsten in their products to investigate these raw materials ’ origin , and to mitigate risks in their supply chains in line with the oecd guidance if they are found to originate in certain conflict-affected or high-risk areas .
the 12 member countries of africa ’s international conference on the great lakes region have committed to similar mandatory due-diligence requirements .
that is as it should be .
responsible sourcing is a duty , not a choice .
they will conclude that they can have it both ways , keeping the benefits of economic integration without losing their ability to infringe on their citizens ’ rights or use eu financial transfers to build patron-client relations and reinforce their hold over the state .
illiberal cee nationalists like hungarian prime minister victor orbán like to claim they are defending national sovereignty from bureaucrats in brussels .
cameron ’s initiative plays right into their hands , allowing orbán and his allies in neighboring countries to declare anathema any move toward ever-closer union and the strengthening of federal authority and legitimacy .
the truth , however , is that cee countries do not have much to lose in the way of sovereignty .
most of their productive and financial assets are owned by foreign companies , just as most of the rules governing their economies have been determined by the eu .
the systemic crises in food , fuel , and finance that came to a head in 2008 – and that are ongoing in many countries – have their roots in an economic paradigm that has not accounted for the value of nature and its array of life-supporting services .
as the recently released report “ towards a green economy : pathways to sustainable development and poverty eradication ” shows , the market economy as currently constituted has resulted in the misallocation of capital on an unprecedented scale .
indeed , the deep and pervasive market failures – in carbon emissions , biodiversity , and ecosystem services – are accelerating environmental risks and ecological scarcities , and undermining human well-being and social equity .
that is why the link to governance and institutions at rio +20 is just as important as the transition to a green economy : markets are human constructs that require rules and institutions to guide not only their direction , but also their boundaries .
one concern among critics is that a transition to a green economy will essentially monetize nature , exposing the world ’s forests , fresh water , and fisheries to the profit-seeking behavior of bankers and traders , whose shortcomings helped to trigger the financial and economic turmoil of the past four years .
third , as usual , israel has accused of anti-semitism those who have dared to criticize its disproportionate response to hamas ’s indefensible rocket attacks and its collective punishment of palestinians .
an italian cardinal , who admittedly spoke intemperately , was accused of using the language of holocaust denial .
by that standard , does my unqualified criticism of hamas ’s rocket attacks make me an islamophobe ?
coincidentally , the deadly attack on gaza came at the same time that a clutch of america ’s most distinguished would-be middle east peacemakers published books about how the task should properly be tackled .
it all sounded a bit like a series of job applications – the war for president barack obama ’s ear .
a similar political imperative is at the heart of the sinhalese chauvinism that has made a sudden return to public life in sri lanka .
the religious and ethnic passions of the sinhalese were encouraged during the final , bloody push that ended sri lanka ’s quarter-century of civil war with the tamil tigers in 2009 .
but instead of seeking reconciliation with the tamils following their defeat , then-president mahinda rajapaksa continued to play on ethnic hatred as he subverted sri lanka ’s democracy .
rajapaksa ’s unexpected defeat by a coalition of sri lanka ’s democrats and tamil political parties in last january ’s presidential election – a result that he then sought to annul – should have ended both his career and the politics of race-baiting .
but the former president is now mounting a furious comeback bid and might well win the parliamentary election scheduled for august 17 .
these are not isolated examples of children caught in the crossfire ; this is what happens when classrooms become the actual targets of terrorists who see education as a threat .
( indeed , boko haram is literally translated to mean that “ false ” or “ western ” education is “ forbidden . ” )
in at least 30 countries , there is a concerted pattern of attacks by armed groups , with afghanistan , colombia , pakistan , somalia , sudan , and syria the worst affected .
such attacks reveal with stark clarity that providing education is not only about blackboards , books , and curricula .
schools around the world , from north america to northern nigeria , now need security plans to ensure the safety of their pupils and provide confidence to parents and their communities .
more scholarship opportunities for refugees , and greater funding for schools within and outside refugee settlements , would also be welcome .
modest seed funding can go a long way toward helping refugee-owned businesses get off the ground .
meanwhile , some companies and organizations – including wework , ikea , and starbucks – are developing innovative approaches to hiring refugees .
global organizations are tapping into networks of tech-savvy refugees and hiring them for online work .
some , such as tent , encourage businesses to hire refugees and integrate them into supply chains where they live .
that is why it is increasingly being rejected in favor of an agro-ecological model based on the principle of “ food sovereignty . ”
the latter approach , which has been endorsed by the un human rights council , calls on farmers to share their existing knowledge and seeds with one another other , and to protect local ecosystems .
next month , representatives from more than 190 countries will meet in sharm el sheikh , egypt , for the 14th meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity ( un biodiversity conference ) .
while there , they will consider whether to press the brakes on gene drives , to ensure that farmers and indigenous peoples are fully consulted before these technologies are unleashed in their communities .
one hopes that the international community will uphold its duty to protect food supplies , as well as the rights of farmers around the world .
it is not exactly clear how long venezuela ’s hugo chávez was actually dead before his passing was officially announced .
buying time to secure their own political future , venezuelan officials carefully stage-managed chávez ’s illness and eventual death , even suggesting near the end , while he was undergoing complex and agonizing cancer treatments , that he was still “ walking and exercising . ”
the information vacuum was reminiscent of the secrecy surrounding the deaths of stalin and mao , and the practice in the ottoman empire of keeping the sultan ’s death a secret for weeks until the succession was settled .
the emotional manipulation of the mise-en-scene surrounding chávez ’s death appears certain to translate into electoral support for his grey successor , nicolás maduro .
but will this suffice to create a chávista lineage ?
governments in developed countries also have a role to play in affecting the nature of technological innovation .
too often , they subsidize labor-replacing , capital-intensive technologies , rather than pushing innovation in socially more beneficial directions , to augment rather than replace less skilled workers .
such policies are unlikely to make much difference to developing countries .
for them , the main obstacle will remain that existing technologies allow insufficient room for factor substitution : using less-skilled labor instead of skilled professionals or physical capital .
the demanding quality standards needed to supply global value chains can not be easily met by replacing machines with manual labor .
berkeley – on january 20 , 2017 , us president-elect donald trump will take office having received almost three million fewer votes than his opponent ; and he will work with a republican senate majority whose members won 13 million fewer votes than their democratic opponents .
only the republican majority in the house of representatives , led by speaker paul ryan , has any claim to represent a numerical majority of the 55 % of americans who voted on election day 2016 .
trump will also begin his presidency with an approval rating below 50 % .
this is unprecedented – or “ unpresidented , ” as one of his semi-literate tweets put it ( before he deleted it ) – in the history of such ratings .
the government of the world ’s oldest democracy is , in fact , not democratic .
the s-400 dispute is merely the latest example of how military procurement matters have created a rift between turkey and its western allies .
in turkey ’s view , its western partners have not done enough , through technology transfer and joint-production schemes , to accommodate its burgeoning defense industry .
in contrast , chinese and , to a lesser extent , russian firms have been more receptive to such turkish demands as part of the latter ’s military procurements .
and domestic defense-industry interests are only part of the story .
more broadly , turkey and the west are undergoing a political , strategic , and geopolitical decoupling , reflected most recently by each side ’s differing threat perceptions and alliances in the syria conflict .
underdevelopment in many countries of the south , which are faring poorly in their struggle to remain viable in a globalizing world , creates conditions of desperate poverty , ecological collapse and rootless , unemployed populations beyond the control of atrophying state systems .
we will not create a better world in the 21 st century by forgetting what happened in the 19 th and much of the 20 th .
this is not to say that our responses to the dangers emerging from the legacies of the past must be rooted in the past .
there is a greater need than ever before for innovative , forward-looking approaches to global governance .
as we embark upon the still-new millennium , though , it seems ironically clear that tomorrow 's possible disorder might be due , in no small part , to yesterday 's colonial order .
in bilateral negations with moscow , us officials have been offering four concrete bmd collaboration projects :
· bi-national and multi-national jointly manned centers where russian personnel can see the non-threatening nature of us and nato missile-defense activities ;
· joint russian-us expert studies regarding how bmd might affect russia ’s nuclear deterrent and what steps can be taken to minimize any problems ;
· expanded nato-russian theater-level bmd exercises that build on earlier collaboration – disrupted by russia ’s august 2008 war with georgia – and that rehearse how deployed nato and russian forces can jointly defend against missile threats ; and
· an underlying legal framework to support these and other cooperative projects .
under these conditions , trump ’s biggest and boldest policy proposals will likely run into budgetary constraints .
he has already ruled out any changes to social security .
his and congressional republicans ’ attempts to replace the affordable care act ( obamacare ) , and to curtail the growth in medicaid spending , have been unsuccessful .
and a temporary increase in defense spending will revert back to insufficient levels after this fiscal year .
although the tax package that trump signed into law last december front-loaded tax cuts and is now helping the economy to grow , government revenue has yet to respond much to that growth .
the eu has always supported a two-state solution , despite the challenging demographic reality , not to mention the need to preserve the jewish state 's identity .
granting observer-state status to palestine would take off the table the prospect of a “ one-state ” solution , which has recently gained momentum among experts .
but these sound reasons for supporting palestine ’s bid probably will not prevent the eu from delivering a split vote , the reverberations of which will not only echo throughout the arab world , inviting accusations of hypocrisy , but will also hinder european efforts to reset relations with countries in the middle east and north africa .
a split vote thus undermines european interests , delivering an unequivocal blow to european foreign policy in a challenging geopolitical environment .
indeed , europe ’s divided stance on the israeli-palestinian conflict exemplifies its poor record of achieving foreign-policy consensus .
moreover , in countries where google is criticized for blocking access to information , it points out the information ’s absence when something is blocked – letting people know that it exists but that they ca n’t have access to it .
on the other hand , every time someone in china googles something and gets an answer – a product ’s good and bad points , the details about someone the government does not like – he must wonder , “ why ca n’t i get this kind of information about everything ? ”
with google , people start to expect answers about everything .
a little transparency inevitably leads to more .
rather than demand an end to censorship now – an impossible dream – google is working to make that happen by eroding government control over information .
although no outcome was formally agreed or made public , several themes emerged from the beijing meeting .
taken together , they offer reason for confidence that it may be possible to recreate international consensus , so long missing in syria , about how to deal with the hardest mass-atrocity cases .
first , there was widespread acceptance that the “ responsibility to protect ” ( r2p ) doctrine , unanimously agreed by the united nations general assembly in 2005 , is here to stay .
r2p recognizes that sovereign states have a responsibility to protect their people from genocide , ethnic cleansing , crimes against humanity , and war crimes ; that other states have a responsibility to assist them to do so ; and that if a state is “ manifestly failing ” to protect its people , the wider international community has a responsibility to step in with “ timely and decisive action , ” which might in an extreme case include military action if approved by the un security council .
true , some chinese scholars remain inclined to argue that the entire r2p enterprise – particularly its sanction of military action in exceptional cases – is just “ old neo-interventionist wine in a new bottle . ”
so the global economy should really be thought of as the global capitalist system .
global integration brought tremendous benefits : the international division of labor , which are so clearly proved by the theory of comparative advantage ; dynamic benefits such as economies of scale and the rapid spread of innovations from one country to another , which are less easy to demonstrate by static equilibrium theory ; and noneconomic benefits such as the freedom of choice associated with the international movement of goods , capital , and people , and the freedom of thought associated with the international movement of ideas .
but global capitalism is not without problems ; we need to understand these better if we want the system to survive .
by focusing on these problems i am not trying to belittle globalization ’s benefits .
these benefits , i believe , can be sustained only by deliberate and persistent efforts to correct and contain the system ’s deficiencies .
trump has been portraying the report ’s findings as completely exonerating him ( “ no collusion , no obstruction ” ) , even though the report explicitly stated that this was not the case .
worse for trump , the widely admired mueller in effect recommended that congress undertake an impeachment process .
mueller explained that a controversial justice department policy , intended to help president richard nixon , bars the indictment of a sitting president .
this is n’t in the constitution , nor is it a law .
( nixon was an unindicted co-conspirator in the watergate burglary cover-up , whereas trump is one in new york case involving his participation in pre-election payoffs to silence two women with whom he had sexual liaisons shortly after the birth of his son barron . )
russia ’s supposed “ peacekeeping troops ” in abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia ’s other secession-minded region , have in fact protected their rebel governments .
russia has also been enforcing a complete trade embargo on georgia in the hope of weakening the resolve of its pro-western president , mikhail saakashvili .
should russia recognize abkhazia ’s independence , saakashvili might be tempted to respond militarily to prevent his country from unraveling .
renewed conflict in abkhazia would not only bring the risk of open warfare with russia , but strain relations with armenia , as there are near to 50,000 armenians in abkhazia who support the breakaway government .
another risk in the south caucasus is that russia ( with armenian support ) will recognize nagorno-karabakh ’s self-proclaimed independence from azerbaijan .
europe must make progress on the first opportunity if it is to seize the second , and that means strengthening the eurozone .
on this front , macron has already offered ambitious proposals : a separate eurozone budget , a eurozone finance minister responsible for it , and a eurozone parliament ( composed of members of the european parliament and national parliamentarians ) to hold the finance minister accountable .
before germany ’s new coalition government was formed , a franco-german working group was established to consider macron ’s proposals .
now that merkel ’s new administration is in place , we will find out how far germany is willing to go in supporting greater eurozone cohesion .
in the short run , it seems unlikely that the new government will support macron ’s proposals in their current form .
in addition , the recent establishment of two other large mdbs – the asian infrastructure investment bank and the new development bank established by the brics countries ( brazil , russia , india , china , and south africa ) – will contribute further to a more balanced public-private mix in development finance .
the financial crisis also prompted some european , african , and asian governments to establish new ndbs , and other countries to expand theirs .
as a result , the total assets of ndbs reached approximately $ 5 trillion in 2015 .
today , they are an important feature of most developed and middle-income countries ’ financial sectors , notably in china , germany , india , and south korea .
and large ndbs can have a big impact , especially in emerging economies .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
as i pointed out earlier this year , the conservatives ’ plan would essentially solve one big problem – the rundown of britain ’s diplomatic service – by creating a much larger problem : the loss of britain ’s soft power .
so what should the us and other governments that support liberal democracy do now ?
the answer could affect egypt ’s political future and that of countries throughout the region .
as many commentators have pointed out , from the islamists ’ standpoint , morsi ’s removal looks remarkably like the algerian military ’s overthrow in 1992 ( with us support ) of an elected islamist government ; the turkish military ’s “ soft coup ” in 1997 , when it forced an elected islamist government out of power ; and the us government ’s reversal of its support for “ arab democracy ” after hamas won elections in gaza in 2006 .
if the choice for islamists is still bullets or ballots , bullets may now look more promising .
more generally , military interference with civilian politics , for any reason , weakens the processes , institutions , and checks on state power that make liberal democracy work .
for example , in the early 2000s , rwanda and ethiopia recruited and trained thousands of such workers to lead the fight against malaria by educating communities on prevention and detection , distributing tools like bed nets , and administering treatment .
as a result , the incidence of malaria fell by 75 % in the two countries from 2000 to 2015 .
yet the world continues consistently to underestimate the capabilities and contributions of frontline health workers .
this not only undermines their ability to do their jobs effectively ; it also puts them at significant risk , with widespread misinformation about vaccines , for example , fueling attacks against those who provide them .
consider pakistan , where hardline clerics and militants view polio vaccination programs as western ploys to sterilize and spy on muslims .
once the potential “ military threat ” posed by the soviet union had vanished into thin air , successive waves of nato enlargement served neither a military nor an ideological purpose .
the west ’s logic for enlargement was geopolitical : to bring the former soviet republics and socialist states of central and eastern europe into the western sphere of political and economic influence .
at first , nato ’s new members were declared to have met both democratic and military criteria .
later , these criteria were abandoned when nato began to invite even the most backward and corrupt states to join .
nato , moreover , not only enlarged its membership , but also transformed itself from an anti-communist defensive alliance into an offensive grouping ( with operations in yugoslavia , iraq and afghanistan ) .
ironically , this was leading the imf to focus on its supervisory role .
so , in searching for the causes of the imf ’s failure , we can rule out distraction by more urgent matters .
the fund normally expects that problems come from the usual suspects – economically volatile developing countries – but this time the crisis was developing a few miles away from its headquarters .
perhaps this proximity was at the root of the imf ’s failure to interpret the evidence right under its nose .
if so , it is a failure that raises two key questions .
it is a shift that raises a major question : if those who are willing to act prove incapable of doing so “ successfully , ” what happens to global stability unless those who are capable are also willing to step in ?
at the crossroads of this question stands nato , an organization perceived as american by europeans and international ( i.e. , not american ) by the average us citizen .
but if nato is – for better or worse – in command on the ground in libya , it is the un that has given the necessary green light to french action there .
it is this specific “ marriage of reason ” between france and the un that is essential to understanding the french position on libya .
indeed , the same relationship between france and the un that led to the country ’s resistance to intervention in iraq in 2003 has now pushed france to intervene in libya in 2011 .
but if that hour was really a lunch with a lobbyist , then they ( and their aides ) would have to lie deliberately to conceal it .
of course , there is no way to enforce full disclosure , but by creating explicit processes and expectations , we hope to reset norms .
if an official meets with a lobbyist and is not ashamed of it , he can simply say so .
voters can make their own judgments .
and if an official meets mostly with lobbyists , at the expense of other types of meetings , voters can make judgments about that , too .
and there is the risk that the tech giants will use their vast armies of programmers to develop a nearly identical product , and their vast legal resources to defend it .
big tech firms might argue that all the capital they pour into new products and services is pushing innovation .
one suspects , however , that in many circumstances the intent is to nip potential competition in the bud .
it is notable that big tech still derives most of its revenues from its companies ’ core products – for example , the apple iphone , microsoft office , and the google search engine .
thus , in practice , potentially disruptive new technologies are as likely to be buried as nourished .
historically , both state and federal attorney generals have preferred to prosecute “ occasional ” traders , who stick out like a sore thumb .
for example , when a tiny italian bank received from someone who never traded a large order for shares of us shoe shortly before the company was acquired by italian eyewear maker luxottica , it was not difficult to smell a fish .
in other words , precisely because occasional traders trade rarely , it is much easier to prove the nexus of causality between their trades and an illegal tip .
by contrast , it is much more difficult to identify a problem when a person makes hundreds of trades every day .
in rajaratnam ’s case , the possibility of establishing such a link has come through telephone surveillance .
african girls are also disproportionately vulnerable to contracting hiv .
roughly 90 % of the world ’s pregnant women and children with hiv live in africa , and , despite notable recent reductions in hiv transmission rates , adolescent girls are still more than twice as likely as boys of the same age to carry the virus .
yet barely a third of young africans know how to prevent hiv – another reason for urgent and comprehensive sexuality education .
another epidemic afflicting african women is violence , all too often perpetrated with impunity .
sexual violence is used as a tactic of war .
new york – many historians and economists insist that we live in an age shaped by vast and impersonal forces .
the actions and decisions of one man or woman , no matter how powerful , can not determine the destiny of nations .
this may be true much or most of the time .
but there are moments when an individual leader ’s choices can change the course of history .
that has certainly been true in russia , and it may soon turn out to be true in turkey as well .
as i show in a new peer-reviewed paper , even if successful , the agreement reached in paris would cut temperatures in 2100 by just 0.05 ° celsius .
the rise in sea level would be reduced by only 1.3 centimeters .
this may seem surprising : we constantly hear how every country has made important commitments to reduce co2 emissions – the so-called “ intended nationally determined contributions , ” or indcs .
according to the un ’s climate chief , christiana figueres , “ the indcs have the capability of limiting the forecast temperature rise to around 2.7 ºc by 2100 , by no means enough but a lot lower than the estimated four , five , or more degrees of warming projected by many prior . ”
figueres suggested that the paris agreement will cut almost 2 ° c of warming , from 4.5 ° c to 2.7 ° c. though her wording was crafted to avoid actually saying this , it was , predictably , what most people heard .
anti-euro political forces are clearly making electoral inroads , and they will continue to gain ground as long as growth remains anemic and unemployment remains high .
in the meantime , the eu will most likely not pursue substantial policy or institutional reforms in the near term , for fear that doing so could adversely affect the outcome of consequential elections this year in the netherlands , france , germany , and possibly italy .
of course , an alternative view holds that brexit , trump ’s election , and the rise of populist and nationalist parties will serve as a wake-up call , and spur europe toward broader integration and growth-oriented policies .
this would require eu policymakers to abandon the view that each country is solely responsible for getting its own house in order , while upholding eu fiscal , financial , and regulatory commitments .
upholding eu rules is no longer practical , because the current system imposes too many constraints and contains too few effective adjustment mechanisms .
russians realized that they did n’t need to win at all costs ; they could be great without the kremlin ’s militaristic say-so .
then the pension reform was announced , spurring a string of protests that drove putin to pledge to soften the measure , while asking for russians ’ understanding .
yet , as of september 3 , 53 % of the population said that they were ready to protest further .
and on september 9 , while local government elections took place , tens of thousands of russians joined protests organized by the anti-corruption lawyer and opposition leader alexei navalny , defying the prohibition of “ political agitation ” on election days .
navalny himself could n’t attend the event , after being arrested for a previous unsanctioned demonstration .
china squandered its economic and technological potential by itself , not because of external force .
by the time europe and china crossed paths in the opium wars of 1839-42 , a technologically superior europe had vast military advantages and so forced china into a series of unilateral , humiliating concessions .
china 's imperial state and society were destabilized by european incursions .
the imperial dynasty collapsed in 1911 , under external pressures and internal demands for change .
change , however , did not come smooth .
the obvious success of these cities , as both government and economic centers , attests to the fact that urban land derives value from the presence of a well-planned city there .
where land today is cheap , it will have great value in the future if only someone takes the dramatic step of planning and creating a whole city there .
true , the establishment of such cities is a relatively rare event .
private developers have trouble getting a large plot free of restrictions .
but they tend to be ingenious at developing glamorous new areas from little towns within an hour ’s commute from major cities .
it can last for awhile but will create increasing friction with economic realty and an increasing incentive for chavez to be authoritarian .
there is no imminent crisis about to happen , but chavez must choose venezuela ’s future .
if he opens the economy and adjusts the exchange rate , there will be a path for growth and stability .
if he goes statist/populist , 2001 will be a crisis year .
so far , venezuela ’s elite , and much of the investment community , has assumed the worst and behaved accordingly : no blueprints for chavez , no options , just badmouthing .
growth is forecast to return above trend by 2005-06 , bringing the current cycle to an end .
the average surplus on the " current " budget since this cycle began is 0.8 % of gdp .
huge surpluses in the three years since 1999 far outweigh the official deficits forecast in the next two years .
this means that the treasury expects the average surplus since 1999/2000 to stabilize at 0.7 % of gdp until the cycle ends , allowing brown 's strictures to be met .
but independent forecasters are more pessimistic .
instead , strategies have been derived from the view that all our behaviors are selfish , with the intellectual challenge being to design “ incentive-compatible ” mechanisms or contracts , an effort that has also been recognized with nobel prizes .
but , as george price showed long ago , darwinian evolution may have made us altruistic , at least toward people we perceive as members of the group we call “ us . ”
the new revolution in economics may find a place for strategies based on affecting ideals and identities , not just taxes and subsidies .
in the process , we may understand that we vote because that is what citizens ought to do , and we excel at our jobs because we strive for respect and self-realization , not just a raise .
if successful , the new revolution may lead to strategies that make us more responsive to our better angels .
such openly thuggish rulers as kuchma of ukraine or lukashenka of belarus , are almost impossible to imagine in romania nowadays .
moreover , joining nato means subsuming romania 's military and intelligence services under nato command ( i.e. american ) control , thus any attempt at staging a coup , or stirring up trouble between romanians and our sizeable hungarian minority , can be prevented .
the more tightly bound to the democratic world a country like romania is , the less likely it is to experience dramatic social or political unrest or to eviscerate its democratic system .
nato fixes hard limits on the autonomy of local political elites to do what they want .
of course , nato can not safeguard democracy alone and it is no panacea for our many social and political illnesses ; yet it can act ( and has already done so during the process of admission ) as an incentive for governments and parties to behave responsibly and to abide by the rule of law .
this is the underlying dynamic driving corruption in china today .
in fact , the consequences of leadership degeneration are easy to see : faltering economic dynamism and growth , rising social tensions , and loss of government credibility .
the puzzle is why neither the compelling self-destructive logic of autocratic rule nor the mounting evidence of deteriorating regime performance in china has persuaded even some of the most knowledgeable observers that the end of ccp rule is now a distinct possibility .
an obvious explanation is the power of conventional thinking .
long-ruling regimes – think of the soviet communist party , indonesia ’s suharto , and egypt ’s hosni mubarak – are typically considered invulnerable , even just before they collapse .
some readers may say that the granddaughter of nikita khrushchev , who , it is falsely said , gaveled his shoe on a desk at the united nations general assembly in 1960 , should steer clear of the topic of world leaders ’ manners .
but there is a point to be made about the recent conduct of the chinese .
when it comes to diplomatic offhandedness , the chinese have long had what british gamblers would call “ form . ”
on a visit to the soviet union , mao zedong famously refused to use the flush toilet adjoining his room , and instead used a chamber pot he had brought from china .
perhaps he suspected that stalin , as the bbc alleged last year , was collecting and analyzing his feces to glean information about the great helmsman ’s temperament .
indeed , a potential heir today needs legitimacy , not only from the powerful oligarchs but also from the street .
that is why so-called “ system liberals , ” or loyalists who stand for kremlin-backed change , want to control the protest movement and use it as a lever in an ultimate fight with the “ siloviks ” ( putin ’s military and security apparatus ) .
system liberals believe that russia has , on the whole , built an acceptable market economy .
its further development requires only the removal of some of putin ’s cronies through controlled political reform .
until recently , the loyalists argued that the quest for change precludes criticizing the government , which should somehow be influenced through constructive suggestions .
my office worked closely with the state to assure that , in most cases , juries are used .
similarly , my office defended the liberal weekly newspaper novoe vremya ( new times ) , which was being pressured by moscow 's city government on the pretext of a commercial dispute about a lease .
that fight is not over , but after my intervention , moscow 's authorities must take into account the public 's negative attitude to their effort to quash this publication .
of course , russia provides far more headline-grabbling examples of political and human rights problems , such as the low-grade war in chechnya or the yukos affair .
my office pays maximum attention to chechnya , although this is not easy to do from moscow .
new delhi – international discussion about china ’s rise has focused on its increasing trade muscle , growing maritime ambitions , and expanding capacity to project military power .
one critical issue , however , usually escapes attention : china ’s rise as a hydro-hegemon with no modern historical parallel .
no other country has ever managed to assume such unchallenged riparian preeminence on a continent by controlling the headwaters of multiple international rivers and manipulating their cross-border flows .
china , the world ’s biggest dam builder – with slightly more than half of the approximately 50,000 large dams on the planet – is rapidly accumulating leverage against its neighbors by undertaking massive hydro-engineering projects on transnational rivers .
asia ’s water map fundamentally changed after the 1949 communist victory in china .
they pose continuing risks to economic stability without providing compensating benefits in terms of increased investment in productive activities .
as stanford ’s anat admati and others have long argued , banks require , at a minimum , higher capital requirements and tighter regulatory scrutiny .
the fact that financial institutions have escaped relatively unscathed from the crisis of 2008-2009 speaks volumes about their political power .
as the failures of financial regulation suggest , important as such economic reforms are , they need to be complemented with measures that remedy the asymmetry of political access .
in the us , holding elections on workdays , rather than weekends or holidays – together with restrictive registration rules , gerrymandering , and myriad other electoral rules – places ordinary workers at a significant disadvantage .
for israel , an occupying power whose people enjoy democratic civilian authority and a gdp tens times that of the people it is denying basic rights of freedom and independence , photo opportunities provided by meeting and greeting palestinian leaders has replaced achieving peace .
a serious look back at the 17 years since yassir arafat and yitzhak rabin shook hands on the white house lawn is revealing .
the number of illegal jewish settlements and settlers has more than doubled in the areas israel occupied in 1967 .
negotiators have parsed every possible solution to the permanent-status issues of jerusalem , borders , settlements , refugees , and economic relations .
leaders of the world ’s superpowers , united nations officials , the elders , and tens of people of goodwill have offered their goodwill offices and their services to bring about peace .
in other words , the export miracle was sparked not by state-sponsored chinese companies but by offshore efficiency solutions crafted in the west .
this led to the economic equivalent of a personal identity crisis : who is china – them or us ?
in personal relationships , denial tends to mask imbalances – but only for so long .
ultimately , the denial cracks and imbalances give rise to frictions and blame – holding a codependent partner responsible for problems of one ’s own making .
such is the case with the us and china .
as lamy has put it , nearly 80 % of the curry is ready ; we need only additional spices from the major players – india , the european union , the us , brazil , and china .
these can be provided in politically palatable ways , which also means that the conclusion of doha is within our reach , not beyond our grasp .
but why bother to continue trying ?
if doha fails , some say , life will go on .
that is true , of course , but that does n’t make this view any less naïve .
the eu has also suddenly awakened to the need for a common external energy-security policy , not least to diversify away from russian supplies .
given that 20 % of russian gas destined for europe passes through belarus , a stable and structured relationship with its government has become a priority .
in turn , lukashenko has decided for economic reasons that his country needs eu support and can no longer depend exclusively on russia without paying a heavy political price .
but the thaw in eu-belarus relations needs to be based on reciprocal , permanent steps .
after all , no eu strategic partnership is unconditional .
paris – the world is witnessing a drastic decline of its natural capital .
plant and animal species worldwide are vanishing at an unprecedented pace – 100 to 1,000 times the natural extinction rate .
the planet ’s most endangered ecosystems are located in developing countries , and thus depend on some of the world ’s neediest communities for their preservation .
conversely , the poor are the first to suffer from deterioration of their natural environment .
but in the developing world , immediate economic needs often override long-term imperatives , and protecting a fragile environment is rarely a priority at the national level .
africa has an exceptionally rich portfolio of clean-energy assets , including almost nine terawatts of solar capacity , more than 350 gigawatts of hydropower capacity , and more than 100 gw of wind-power potential .
this is more than enough to meet the continent ’s future demand .
at the same time , renewable-energy sources are becoming less expensive , making them increasingly competitive with fossil-fuel alternatives .
for example , the price of utility-scale photovoltaic solar energy in africa fell by 50 % between 2010 and 2014 , and continues to decrease today .
and south africa ’s renewable energy independent power producer procurement programme has seen an overall decline in bid prices and oversubscription rates .
paris – immigration-related headlines have become a staple in europe , whether the story is of an illegal malian immigrant scaling a paris building to rescue a toddler or the formation of a populist government in italy that aims to deport a half-million migrants .
and yet , despite the constant coverage of the issue – or , more likely , precisely because of it – the immigration policy debate remains beset by misconceptions and politicization .
in the united kingdom , the brexit vote was fueled partly by false and distorted claims , such as that unrestrained migration from the rest of europe was driving down wages .
since the vote , however , the anti-brexit camp has engaged in similar distortions , warning that , once it has left the european union , the uk will face a skills shortage .
but plenty of countries – such as australia , canada , and singapore – do just fine without agreements guaranteeing freedom of movement from other countries , by issuing skills-matching visas .
that is not to suggest that we should scrap or revise gdp ; but we do need to recognize its limitations .
the problem with gdp is not that it is a poor measure of material wellbeing ( setting aside distributional issues ) , but that it is incomplete .
it does not include the increase in the scope of goods and services delivered at negative incremental cost , nor the non-material side of individual wellbeing or social progress more generally .
looking ahead , the same cost-structure dynamics promise to produce large increases in many areas of wellbeing .
most medical professionals will soon have digital assistants to offer diagnoses ( particularly for certain cancers , diabetic retinopathy , and other chronic illnesses ) , perform non-invasive surgeries , or find pertinent published research .
whereas psephological studies in the united states have demonstrated that the poor do not vote in significant numbers ( presidential-election turnout in harlem averaged 23 % before barack obama ’s two candidacies ) , the opposite is true in india .
in india , it is the poor who take the time to line up in the hot sun , believing that their votes will make a difference , whereas more privileged voters , knowing that their views and numbers will do little to influence the outcome , have been staying at home .
studies of indian elections have consistently shown that the poorest vote in numbers well above the national average , while the educated middle-class turn out in numbers well below it .
the significant changes in the social composition of india ’s politicians and bureaucrats since independence are indeed proof of democracy at work .
but many lament that the poor performance of the country ’s political class in general offers less cause for celebration .
should we be watching the french presidential campaign with admiration or alarm ?
or perhaps a bit of both ?
it is undeniably a great “ show ” with all the ingredients of a hollywood blockbuster , including a surprising plot twist : the emergence of a “ third man , ” françois bayrou .
even if his victory remains unlikely , bayrou must now be taken seriously .
first and foremost , he has found in ségolène royal and nicolas sarkozy two remarkable spokespersons for his candidacy .
but that may be changing in response to us president donald trump ’s escalating attacks on the rules-based trading system .
japan recently agreed to negotiate a preferential trade agreement with the united states that could challenge one of the pillars of the multilateral trading system : the “ most favored nation ” ( mfn ) obligation , which states that any concessions or privileges granted to one country in a trade deal must be extended to all wto members .
here , japan is again acting “ voluntarily , ” under strong pressure from the us .
according to press reports , trump has presented japan with a stark choice : open its ( very protected ) market to american agricultural exports , or face increased us tariffs on automobiles and other industrial goods .
gaining access to japan ’s agricultural market would , it seems , render moot trump ’s “ national security ” concerns over imported toyotas and hondas – the justification that allows him to circumvent wto rules with his tariffs .
not unlike holland in the early 1980s , brazil 's economy today faces the challenge of stimulating rapid employment growth amid fiscal constraints and high interest rates .
while brazil 's registered unemployment rate is not very high by regional standards , its fast growing labor force requires a high rate of job creation .
emulating the dutch experience with job creation provides the surest possible path to alleviating poverty in brazil .
the idea is not that brazil should seek to implement the dutch social-economic model -- the countries are too different for that .
but lula can and should follow kok 's example and use his trade union connections , as well as his rapport with the working class , to achieve a social pact aimed at achieving sustained improvement in brazil 's overall economic performance and realizing its potential to become latin america 's economic powerhouse .
consider emma gonzález , a previously unknown florida teenager who “ assembled ” two times more twitter followers than the national rifle association almost overnight .
by following an eloquent survivor of the parkland massacre , 1.66 million twitter users have signaled their support for stronger gun-control regulations , and their opposition to the us gun lobby .
nonetheless , assembly in physical space fulfills functions for democracy that online activity , however permanent or passionate , simply can not .
in 2011 , when then-us representative barney frank asked why occupy wall street protesters “ think that simply being in a physical place does much , ” an appropriate answer would have been : “ actually , occupying public spaces can accomplish a great deal , depending on who the occupiers are and how many they number . ”
hence , the civil rights marchers in the us during the 1950s and 1960s often evoked the “ meaning of our numbers . ”
economic commentators are better at rationalizing past exchange-rate movements than at forecasting future trends .
so , when it comes to explanations for the dollar ’s decline over the past year , we are confronted by an embarrassment of riches .
the most popular explanation for dollar weakness is that trump , through incompetence or misdirection , failed to deliver what he promised .
there was no across-the-board import tariff .
there was no abrogation of the north american free trade agreement .
of course , some worried about the collapse of the household savings rate , but few were overly concerned .
in one of his last articles , milton friedman wrote that savings nowadays took the form of houses .
to me , this view of things explains much better than the orthodox account why , for all the money-pumping by central banks , commercial banks have not started lending again , and the economic recovery has petered out .
just as lenders did not force money on the public before the crisis , so now they can not force heavily indebted households to borrow , or businesses to seek loans to expand production when markets are flat or shrinking .
in short , recovery can not be left to the fed , the european central bank , or the bank of england .
but there do seem to be some fundamental rules of political survival that have been ignored in australia in recent years , and spelling them out may help both the alp and others to remember them .
the first rule is to have a philosophy – and to stick to it .
the hugely successful labor governments led by bob hawke and paul keating two decades ago did just that , essentially inventing the “ third way ” model that later became associated with tony blair and gordon brown in britain .
its elements were clear : dry , free-market economics ( but in our case with low-paid workers benefiting enormously from “ social wage ” increases in medical care and retirement income ) ; compassionate social policy ; and a liberal internationalist foreign policy .
by contrast , the current alp government has struggled until now to re-create anything as compelling .
this is the fifth piece of the comprehensive plan .
finally , to absorb and integrate more than a million asylum seekers and migrants a year , the eu needs to mobilize the private sector – ngos , church groups , and businesses – to act as sponsors .
this will require not only sufficient funding , but also the human and it capacity to match migrants and sponsors .
the exodus from war-torn syria should never have become a crisis .
it was long in the making , easy to foresee , and eminently manageable by europe and the international community .
a corollary is that wealth drops as the value of fuel-inefficient houses , gluttonous cars , and oil companies ’ shares declines .
the problem does not come from the use of a price instrument .
it would be the same in a planned economy : carbon efficiency would also require old , inefficient equipment to be discarded and additional investment so that gdp becomes less carbon-intensive .
with recent estimates putting the required additional investment at some 2 % of gdp annually in 2040 , a correspondingly smaller share of output will be available for household consumption .
furthermore , the distributional effects of the green transition are unfortunately adverse .
but it also represents an opportunity to forge a new uk-eu partnership .
and besides , things could have been much worse .
owing to the withdrawal agreement that was concluded this past october , a destructive “ hard ” brexit has been averted .
since the beginning of the brexit negotiations , we on the eu side – the 27 member states and the european parliament – have not strayed from the bloc ’s core interests nor lost sight of the need for unity and solidarity .
our priority was first and foremost to secure the rights of european citizens , including by finding a solution for the people of northern ireland and ireland , for whom the negotiations were about peace and stability , not just trade and the economy .
the israeli-palestinian conflict continues to be the diplomatic charade that it has been for many years now .
and nothing has attenuated the tensions between israel and both syria and lebanon .
history teaches that diplomacy all too frequently produces results only when backed by overwhelming power .
such was the existentialist worldview of us president and nobel peace prize laureate theodore roosevelt , a major advocate of american expansionism : “ a just war is , in the long run , far better for a man ’s soul than the most prosperous peace . ”
a century later , another american president , barack obama , immersed in two hopeless wars in the middle east , received his nobel peace prize with an apology for “ just wars . ”
yet , today , as iran ’s influence grows and islamist terrorism continues to proliferate , palestine is the last of saudi arabia ’s worries .
so fundamental are the changes to the kingdom ’s strategic interests that , despite being the custodian of islam ’s holiest sites , it said nothing when us president donald trump recognized jerusalem as israel ’s “ eternal capital . ”
other sunni gulf monarchies , as well as egypt , have gone further , engaging in security cooperation with israel .
politics is also superseding religion within israel .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu ’s expansionist drive in the west bank is about political power , not judaism .
europe is abuzz with mergers not only to take advantage of europe 's broader economic space but also to confront tough competition in world markets .
in sum , the old continent is hot .
no one can say how deep the changes will go , nor how fast they will shift europe into the fast lane .
no day passes without major headlines of big mergers in europe ; germany is ablaze as its mammoth corporations are performing mating rites .
in france big strategic plays are underway in banks and fashion ; italy is seeing its major players position themselves on a european and world scale .
germany ’s binding fiscal rules set a positive example for other eurozone countries .
but all eurozone governments need to demonstrate their own commitment to fiscal consolidation in order to restore the confidence of markets – and of their own citizens .
recent studies show that once a government ’s debt burden reaches a threshold perceived to be unsustainable , more debt will only stunt , not stimulate , economic growth .
greece ’s debt crisis was a clear warning that european policymakers must not allow public debt to pile up indefinitely .
the eu was right to react decisively to ensure the euro ’s stability by providing short-term assistance to greece and establishing the european financial stabilization mechanism .
not considered to be part of the native russian people , jews were assumed to belong to an international cabal , and hence to be inherently treacherous .
but stalin did n’t invent this idea .
in the 1930s , fascists and nazis also denounced jews , as well as marxists and freemasons , as “ cosmopolitans ” or “ internationalists ” – people whose loyalty was suspect .
it is the kind of vocabulary that emerges from nativist movements that are hostile to ethnic or religious minorities , or to financial or intellectual elites who supposedly conspire to undermine the true sons and daughters of the nation .
to prewar fascists , the us was often regarded as the symbol of cosmopolitan decadence .
“ they should not come near the shariah .
it should be above the constitution , and not an article for referendum . ”
but was the ansar al-shariah brigade really behind the attack on the us consulate ?
the nature of libya ’s post-revolution armed islamist forces is by no means straightforward .
salafi jihadism is not an organization , but an ideological trend based on the core belief that armed tactics of all kinds are the most effective – and , in some versions , the most legitimate – method of bringing about social and political change .
their hope surely dwindled further when they saw bulldozers arrive to prepare the ground for new settlements – not an uncommon occurrence .
the number of israelis living in exclusively jewish settlements in the west bank has tripled since the 1993 signing of the memorandum of understanding between the palestine liberation organization and israel .
in any case , israel now seems to have dropped the charade .
in london early this month , netanyahu refused three times to answer questions from the press about his support for the two-state solution .
he recently said that his ultimate aim is for palestinians to have a palestinian “ state minus ” that is limited in size and sovereignty .
the euro ’s design flaw – an economic union motivated by politics but expressed in economics – has become manifest .
structural changes to economies that experienced a sharp fall in interest rates when they joined a germany-dominated currency bloc now must be made quickly , in crisis , and without the luxury of devaluation .
the pain that this policy is causing has been revealed in protests across the continent and in the bitter impact on many struggling families , the young , and the elderly .
the foundation of the pro-europe case was partly the promise of ever upward prosperity .
at present that promise is severely in question .
the problem after all is not in east germany but rather in the west .
unification meant that everybody gets not only the benefits of west german economic institutions – property rights and hard money – but also all disastrously negative institutions : unions , overpaid unemployment and excessive job security , pervasive regulation .
if west germany , in the face of unification , had rolled back all these unaffordable limitations to the free play of markets , the economic costs would have been far lower : east and west germany would have more nearly full employment , the drive for productivity would have been far more aggressive .
of course , german corporatism did not allow such a solution : unions wanted their wages protected .
the only way to secure them was for the government to pay lots in unemployment compensation in a high wage east germany .
amman – recently , israel ’s vice prime minister shaul mofaz offered an unequivocal veto on a key issue in the middle east peace process .
any return of the golan heights to syria would result in an “ iranian foothold ” on israel ’s border and would thus not only be politically naïve but irrational .
mofaz ’s statement is symptomatic of a perception that is now deeply entrenched , not only in the middle east , but in the united states as well .
that notion is of a hegemonic iran that is attempting to dominate the region through an array of shiite proxies .
this iranian fifth column is believed to stretch from beirut via damascus , gaza to baghdad and finally from iran to saudi-arabia to yemen . recent armed clashes between hezbollah and the lebanese government are , it is said , just another sign of iran ’s hegemonic reach .
stanford – successful political candidates try to implement the proposals on which they ran .
in the united states , president barack obama and the democrats , controlling the house of representatives and ( a filibuster-proof ) senate , had the power to do virtually anything they wanted in 2009 – and so they did .
obama and his congressional allies enacted an $ 800 billion “ stimulus ” bill that was loaded with programs geared to key democratic constituencies , such as environmentalists and public employees ; adopted a sweeping and highly unpopular health-care reform ( whose constitutionality will be determined by the supreme court this year ) ; imposed vast new regulations on wide swaths of the economy ; embraced an industrial policy that selects certain companies for special treatment ; engaged in borrowing and spending at levels exceeded only in world war ii ; and centralized power in washington , dc ( and , within the federal government , in the executive branch and regulatory agencies ) .
the last election that was followed by such a sweeping change in policy direction occurred in 1980 , when president ronald reagan overhauled taxes , spending , and regulation , and supported the federal reserve ’s course of disinflation .
while the 1988 , 1992 , and 2000 elections were also quite consequential , the policy shifts were not nearly as large as in 1980 and 2008 .
all sides agree that the stability of the international economy is predicated on a system of global rules .
what is contested is the nature of these rules .
opponents of trade liberalization decry the secretiveness and " non-democratic " nature of the wto , and the influence of corporate interests in rule-making .
they see a trading system that privileges business over labor , the environment , and consumer safety .
developing countries complain about restrictive rules applied to their exports ( garments , agricultural products , labor services ) , and fear that new demands they face over labor and the environment are designed to undermine their competitiveness .
but , having fought for freedom from apartheid south africa , geingob says , namibia must defend the freedoms it won .
besides , geingob recognizes how transparency protects him from demands for favors from corporate and other interest groups .
not all of namibia ’s key resources are finite .
some – like fisheries – are renewable , and the government is working hard to preserve and enhance them .
most important , unlike most other resource-dependent economies , it has succeeded in diversifying the economy – to the point that services account for more than 60 % of its gdp , with tourism leading the way .
the vulnerability of gordon ’s argument is his shortened time horizon for ir # 3 .
consider the following four sentences in his paper :
· “ both the first two revolutions required about 100 years for their full effects to percolate through the economy . ”
· “ at a minimum , it took 150 years for ir # 1 to have its full range of effects . ”
· “ the inventions of ir # 2 were so important … that they took a full 100 years to have their main effect . ”
given all this , the most critical policy question in emerging markets today is how to respond to inflows that will inevitably drive up their exchange rates and threaten export-led growth .
the first option is to do nothing and allow the currency to appreciate .
this may be the right response if the inflows and upward pressure on the exchange rate are driven by fundamental factors ( a current-account surplus , an undervalued currency , a large and persistent growth differential ) .
but , in many cases , inflows are driven by short-term factors , fads , and irrational exuberance , which can lead to an overvalued currency , the crowding out of non-traditional export sectors or import-competing sectors , a loss of competitiveness , and eventually a large current-account deficit and thus tighter external constraints on growth .
this problem is exacerbated by the fact that the world ’s biggest exporter , china , is aggressively intervening to minimize any appreciation of the renminbi .
plunging debt service is largely an outgrowth of the fed ’s unprecedented zero-interest-rate policy .
as long as the stock of debt remains excessive , consumers will dismiss the reduction in interest expenses as nothing more than a temporary subsidy from the fed .
moreover , the decline in unemployment largely reflects persistently grim labor-market conditions , which have discouraged many workers from remaining in the labor force .
if the labor-force participation rate was 66 % , as it was in early 2008 , rather than 62.8 % , as it was in december 2013 , the unemployment rate would be just over 11 % , not 6.7 % .
yes , there has been some progress on the road to recovery .
but while she likes to raise her voice , she acts with caution : today ’s german fiscal adjustment is , in reality , very gradual .
the countries facing the fiercest budget battles are , instead , the united kingdom and the us , where fiscal deficits exceeded 10 % of gdp in 2010 .
in london , prime minister david cameron is on the offensive .
upon assuming office , he entrusted budgetary forecasting to a new , independent office for budget responsibility ( obr ) , thus forfeiting any opportunity for sleight-of-hand .
he then announced a bold consolidation program to cut the cyclically adjusted deficit by 1.5 % of gdp per year , thereby targeting a deficit of 3.5 % of gdp in 2013 .
indeed , demilitarization of sinai is one of the fundamental elements of the stability of egypt ’s peace with israel .
other great and independent countries , such as japan , germany , and austria , have been subjected for decades to limitations on their acquisition of certain weapons and military equipment .
similarly , the refusal of palestinian refugees ’ claim to a right of return to israel proper is understandable , logical , and just .
what sense would it make to bring back millions of palestinians into a state whose character and symbols are foreign to them – a state where the majority belongs to another ethnic group ?
are they to go back to homes and farms that no longer exist ?
in austria , voters will choose between a pro- and an anti-eu candidate in the nationalist mold of le pen , norbert hofer of the austrian freedom party ( fpö ) .
a victory for hofer could add wind to le pen ’s sails .
the constitutional changes that renzi ’s yes campaign is asking voters to approve would undo some of his predecessor silvio berlusconi ’s legacy – a legacy that serves as a prime example of the damage right-wing populism can do to a country .
among other things , berlusconi altered italy ’s political system in such a way as to prevent the left from ever gaining full power again , and to block any criminal charges that could be leveled against him .
renzi ’s proposed reforms would , among other things , modernize the political system by disempowering the senate ( the upper house of parliament ) .
still , it is important to remember that there ’s a positive aspect to the party ’s self-confidence .
as political scientist kevin o’brien has argued , china ’s increased readiness to compromise with some domestic protesters , rather than treat all forms of collective action as subversive , can be seen as reflecting a growing sense of security .
conversely , some of china ’s most disturbing moves can be chalked up to exaggerated feelings of insecurity .
consider the harsh treatment of the gadfly critic liu xiaobao , sentenced to 11 years in prison on trumped-up charges of “ subversion ” for launching an internet petition drive championing civil liberties .
would a truly self-confident ruling elite have been so skittish about his activism ?
but discussions about competition and fair trade again demonstrate the intellectual poverty and inequity of trade negotiations .
anti-dumping laws are intended to ensure fair trade by preventing the sale of goods below cost .
within the developed countries , there has long been concern about such behavior -- so-called `` predation '' -- and well-defined standards have been developed .
with globalization , it would be natural to extend such principles to the international arena , making it irrelevant whether a producer is domestic or foreign when judging whether he is engaged in an unfair trade practice .
but it does make a difference whether a good is produced at home or abroad .
but start treaty ratification is going nowhere fast in the us senate and progress on other key issues has been slow or shaky : bringing the comprehensive test ban treaty into force ; starting negotiations on a new treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ; strengthening the non-proliferation regime with effective measures to detect violations and deter treaty walk-outs ; reaching agreement on some form of international management of the most sensitive aspects of the fuel cycle ; and , above all , starting new rounds of serious disarmament talks , involving not just the two nuclear superpowers , but all eight nuclear-armed states .
arms control and disarmament is a grinding , unglamorous business that brings few quick returns .
with domestic issues and re-election anxieties now dominating most political agendas , it will be all too easy for commitment to wane .
if that is to be avoided , continued leadership from the top – above all from obama and russian president dmitri medvedev – will be indispensable .
but there are a number of major contributions that less powerful states and leaders , as well as civil-society organizations , can make .
“ that was the investigation , ” he replied .
the military had investigated the military .
this “ apparent suicide ” seemed immediately suspicious to me .
i had just toured those cells : it is literally impossible to kill yourself in them .
their interiors resemble the inside of a smooth plastic jar ; there are no hard edges ; hooks fold down ; there is no bedding that one can use to strangle oneself .
in south africa , for example , the unodc has established three centers ( in mpumalanga , the eastern cape , and the northern cape ) that offer legal counsel and medical care to women , and that work with men to help break the cycle of domestic violence .
moreover , because more needs to be done to improve the world ’s understanding of gender-based violence , the unodc is working with the international community to develop a more detailed and accurate picture of the problem .
this includes examining the causes of male-on-female violence and assessing the associated risk factors , such as the incidence of drug and alcohol use .
but gathering information is only one step toward closing loopholes in criminal laws and overcoming gaps in prevention policies .
decisive policy action , supported by more rigorous enforcement of relevant laws , is needed to improve reporting and prosecution rates , which remain low in many countries .
the main driver of the higher ex post real returns is the comparatively high coupon these sovereign bonds offer .
beyond the return history itself , there is the fact that emerging and developing economies now account for about two-thirds of global gdp , compared to just one-third 50 years ago , when portfolio diversification was almost entirely a domestic affair .
adding to the attractiveness of a portfolio of emerging-market sovereign securities , its returns are not perfectly correlated with equity returns .
moreover , there is evidence that creditor rights and enforcement powers in external sovereign debt markets have increased in the wake of recent us court judgements .
these findings are not an invitation to embrace indiscriminate risk taking .
but the higher home prices rise , the further they will fall – and the greater the collateral economic and financial damage will be – when the bubble deflates .
in countries where non-recourse loans allow borrowers to walk away from a mortgage when its value exceeds that of their home , the housing bust may lead to massive defaults and banking crises .
in countries ( for example , sweden ) where recourse loans allow seizure of household income to enforce payment of mortgage obligations , private consumption may plummet as debt payments ( and eventually rising interest rates ) crowd out discretionary spending .
either way , the result would be the same : recession and stagnation .
what we are witnessing in many countries looks like a slow-motion replay of the last housing-market train wreck .
but the arab world is divided about how to deal with the sudden rise in iranian power .
the tension is particularly acute in saudi arabia , which has warned the us about the dangers of iraq ’s possible collapse and now finds itself in an unequal face-off with iran .
some in the kingdom argue that saudi arabia must confront iran , stand up for sunni arab interests , and become a hands-on regional power .
other saudis believe that confrontation will only lead to wider wars and are urging dialogue and accommodation .
in this view , the us , not iran , produced the region ’s current problems .
beijing – us president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping may have agreed at the g20 summit in osaka to resume trade negotiations , but the path to ending the trade war remains far from clear .
after all , the two leaders reached a similar agreement at the previous g20 summit – in buenos aires last december – and those talks ultimately failed , not least because trump mistook china ’s conciliatory attitude for weakness .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
when asked to choose between the risk of being known to posterity as the central banker who let the system collapse and the intangible future benefits of teaching risk takers a lesson , it does not take genius to predict the central banker ’s decision .
democracy tends to institutionalize moral hazard in sectors that are economically or politically important , such as finance or real estate , allowing them to privatize gains and socialize losses .
even though the authorities insist that the next time will be different , everyone knows that they will make the same decision when confronted with the same choice again .
so , knowing that next time will not be different , the authorities try their best to prevent a “ next time . ”
but risk takers have every incentive to try their luck again , knowing that , at worst , they will be bailed out .
among the large continental countries , including india and brazil , only china has a small segment of coastline but vast interior regions .
when the main object of human consumption was food , this was not a problem , because what mattered was land and water .
but in modern industrial , urban , and market-based societies , what may matter increasingly are transport costs , which means that geography can cause deep regional inequalities .
though such disparities can , of course , have other causes as well , geography does seem to explain a lot .
first of all , it explains why china ’s coastal regions developed earlier and faster after the country launched its market reforms and opened to the world .
the idea that some version of the soros plan would have accelerated growth is speculative at best .
most of the benefit of mortgage reduction flows to consumers only over time .
as a result , careful calculations about the impact of mortgage reductions on aggregate demand ( which we performed and which johnson and soros have not ) do not bear out their claims : the extra spending per dollar of relief was likely to be less than a dime on the dollar of government resources expended .
this leaves aside the further lesson , gained from experience , that institutions with large amounts of public capital tend to be very passive about increasing lending .
fifth , in the political environment that prevailed in 2009 , it would have been difficult or impossible to get more money for the troubled asset relief program .
because many contracts are “ sticky " ( that is , not easily revised ) in monetary terms , inflation and deflation would both inflict damage on the economy .
rising prices reduce the value of savings and pensions , while falling prices reduce profit expectations , encourage hoarding , and increase the real burden of debt .
keynes 's dictum has become the ruling wisdom of monetary policy ( one of his few to survive ) .
governments , according to the conventional wisdom , should aim for stable prices , with a slight bias toward inflation to stimulate the “ animal spirits " of businessmen and shoppers .
in the ten years prior to the 2008 financial crisis , independent central banks set an inflation target of about 2 % , in order to provide economies with a price-stability “ anchor . "
margaret thatcher was always an opponent of the ideal of a politically integrated europe .
british hostility to this objective has become increasingly fierce , as john major lost his tory majority in parliament , and fell under the power of the anti-europeans in his party .
today the british appear an insuperable obstacle to the attainment by the others of a more integrated eu .
in law , the british can prevent unwelcome developments in the eu , because the union is based on a treaty ; therefore the british have an effective veto over any change in the treaty .
in practice , the british have already lost this power because they demanded , and got , the right to opt out of participating in emu .
princeton – democracy everywhere is facing serious challenges .
the united states is gripped by the most bizarre presidential primary campaign in living memory , with populist outsiders threatening to topple established party machines .
brazil is paralyzed by constitutional crisis .
europeans trace their malaise to a democratic deficit in the european union .
and , in the united kingdom , the vision of recovered national sovereignty is fueling the campaign to leave the eu .
to avoid exciting the markets , it would have to be voluntary .
persuading the bondholders to agree would be challenging – even more so in light of recent court decisions in the united states that strengthen the hand of holdout investors .
but there is no superior alternative .
ukraine would be an ideal candidate for re-profiling .
given uncertainty about the country ’s near-term prospects , both a mega-bailout and a full-fledged debt restructuring would be overkill .
in times of shortage , it is the refugees who are likely to be among the first to feel the effects .
water supplies in many refugee camps , in both jordan and lebanon , have been cut to a minimum – a decision that affects millions of people who are already enduring scorching temperatures .
at rukban , a refugee camp on jordan ’s joint border with syria and iraq , more than 85,500 residents each receive barely five liters per day for cooking , drinking , and washing .
the situation in yemen is similarly grim .
racked by sectarian violence and civil war , the country has no functioning government to manage water resources .
first , the volume of jgbs has soared relative to japanese household assets .
japanese households hold about ¥ 1,100 trillion in net monetary assets , an amount that will be exceeded in about 3-5 years by the value of jgbs .
at that point , government debt will no longer be backed up by taxpayers ’ assets .
and , reflecting the aging of japanese society , the household savings rate itself will decline dramatically , making it difficult for the private sector to finance annual budget deficits .
at the same time , japan ’s demographic trends will boost demand for fiscal expenditure , as pension and health-care costs rise .
a lot has been happening in yugoslavia recently , much of it surprising .
after some procrastination and an initial failed attempt , milosevic has been arrested , without bloodshed , though not without danger .
the peaceful vote in montenegro last weekend may presage conflict and difficult decisions about independence , but chances are strong that the parties will settle these matters by talking rather than fighting .
these are great steps forward , and they show that despite brainwashing and the complicity of many serbs in the crimes of the milosevic regime , democracy and open society have a chance of taking root in what remains of yugoslavia .
one key decision facing serbia , and its new authorities , is whether milosevic should be extradited to the hague .
as political pressure on central banks , including the ecb , increases , its president must not hesitate to criticize european politicians and , if necessary , publicly name and shame them .
the ecb ’s independence is its most valuable asset – indeed , it is indispensible .
a good central banker must be able to say no to politicians .
this does not mean the ecb president should pick fights whenever possible .
on the contrary , he should be able to build support for the ecb ’s independence .
greece could in principle have counted on a large amount of regional development aid from the european union budget , which was underutilized owing to a lack of local co-financing .
it took until last summer to recognize – and even then only to a modest degree – that this aid could be used to support economic recovery .
europe ’s final error was a certain level of indifference to fair burden-sharing .
it is understandable that the imf , a technocratic institution , does not venture beyond macroeconomics .
but the eu is a political entity that has made social justice one of its fundamental goals .
brussels – the consequences of europe ’s debt crisis are all too present throughout much of the european union , as distressed economies attempt to stabilize and grow at the same time .
notwithstanding the important decisions taken over the last couple of years , the reality is that we need to do more to tackle the challenges facing the eurozone .
reform and consolidation measures are being implemented across the eu .
joint financial backstops have been put in place .
and the european central bank has consistently shown that it will stand by the euro .
but the rise of interactive social networking has made financial innovation more bottom-up .
millions of bank customers using mobile phones can provide immediate feedback on which products and services they like or dislike .
in the future , client-service and transaction-management systems will receive more input from customers more frequently , so that product design is shaped interactively .
the current strategy in the financial sector drives excessive competition by increasing market share at rivals ’ expense , often breaking trust with customers for the sake of short-term gains .
yet the financial sector has , in previous eras , proven that it can operate as a public good by providing trustworthy , efficient services .
so the unraveling of multi-national states is a false path .
the way forward lies in democratic forms of federalism , which can preserve sufficient central authority for the purposes of statehood , while respecting local and regional cultures .
today ’s upsurge of micro-nationalism is not just a consequence of the revolt against empires : it is also a revolt against globalization .
there is widespread resistance to the idea that the chief function of modern states is to slot their peoples into a global market dominated by the imperatives of efficiency and cheapness , heedless of the damage to non-economic activities .
this feeling is strengthened when the global economy turns out to be a global casino .
still , it is right to ask if the american way of life will survive the twenty-first century , and , if it does , whether it will survive in america or migrate elsewhere as the us economy and political system collapse under the accumulated weight of decades of myopic national leadership and squandered opportunities .
indeed , chinese president hu jintao ’s recent trip to washington was seen by many – particularly many chinese – as the passing of the torch .
pessimists have been saying this for a long time .
optimists , touting gdp and other indicators , will continue to insist that americans have never had it so good .
if there is any continuity worth underscoring , it is the regular cohabitation of boosterism with declinism : america ’s glass is always simultaneously half full and half empty .
but even as those uncertainties play out , both countries are engaging in a kind of zero-sum transfer of emotions that is impossible to ignore .
in the past , traveling to london from paris , one could easily sense the difference between the two cities .
london was bursting with dynamism , and proud to assert itself as the world capital of multiculturalism .
paris , although undeniably more beautiful , was in danger of becoming a new rome , a prisoner of its past glory , at best a place to visit , but not a place to be .
today , confidence has been sucked out of britain by social and political upheaval , terrorism , and uncertainty about the country ’s future .
these speculative investments can further strengthen the trend and push futures price further away from market equilibrium , especially if many investors follow suit or those who invest have sufficient funds to influence the market .
index funds are an example of such powerful investors .
they have become key players in the market , holding about 25-35 % of all agricultural futures contracts .
besides investing large amounts of money , they hold futures contracts for a long time , which might make them less likely to react to changes in market fundamentals .
empirical evidence yields no clear answer concerning which hypothesis is correct .
i have never been heavily involved in partisan politics , but these are not normal times .
president george w. bush is endangering the united states and the world 's safety while undermining american values .
for opposing him , i have been demonized by the bush campaign .
president bush ran in 2000 on a platform promising a " humble " foreign policy .
if re-elected , the bush doctrine of preemptive action - and the invasion of iraq - will be endorsed , and the world will have to live with the consequences .
the balkan wars of the 1990 's ravaged not only millions of people , but also the social institutions that gave shape to their lives .
indeed , the changes brought about by yugoslavia 's dissolution and the wars of succession that followed annihilated large parts of the traditional education and training systems of serbia , croatia , bosnia , macedonia , and kosovo .
since then , stability and hope have begun to return to a region affected by the destruction of war and the widespread despair of social displacement .
the balkan stability pact of 1999 and massive international support have helped rebuild local education , while developing innovative vocational education and training systems that should boost long-term employment .
the results of many projects in these countries are encouraging , with the current focus on training key groups , such as entrepreneurs , teachers , and young and unemployed people .
thus , two important steps have been taken : one by the people of iran , who have shown that they understand the challenges they face , and the other by their new president , who has assembled the best team available to undertake an enormously difficult program .
there is an expression in iran that applies to the international community : “ you can wake only someone who is sleeping , not someone who is pretending to be asleep . ”
whether iran ’s international interlocutors act on the importance of rouhani ’s election is a matter of choice , not of ignorance .
in a middle east so full of uncertainty , a more predictable iran – one that behaves like a regionally important state , not a destabilizing shia movement whose ambitions exceed what international law permits – would be in everyone ’s interest .
there can be no path from the middle east ’s agony without the participation , commitment , and determination of all parties .
nairobi – with unemployment soaring , bankruptcies climbing , and stock markets in free-fall , it may at first glance seem sensible to ditch the fight against climate change and put environmental investments on hold .
but this would be a devastating mistake of immediate , as well as inter-generational , proportions .
far from burdening an already over-stressed , over-stretched global economy , environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work , get order books flowing , and assist in powering economies back to health .
in the past , concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury ; today , it is a necessity – a point grasped by some , but by no means all , economic architects yet .
a big slice of president barack obama ’s $ 825 billion stimulus package for the united states includes a boost to renewable energy , “ weatherizing ” a million homes , and upgrading the country ’s inefficient electricity grid .
we could perhaps all be happy working fewer hours if the decline reflected gradual social progress .
but we are not happy with unemployment that results from a sudden fiscal crisis .
that is why sudden austerity can not be a morale builder .
for morale , we need a social compact that finds a purpose for everyone , a way to show oneself to be part of society by being a worker of some sort .
and for that we need fiscal stimulus – ideally , the debt-friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures equally .
that federal law , enacted in june 2016 , also established an oversight board with fiscal decision-making authority for the us commonwealth .
the restructuring process started on may 3 , when the board filed a petition in federal court .
but many crucial decisions have yet to be taken , such as how much overall debt relief will be provided , and how the “ haircut ” will be distributed among holders of different types of bonds .
these decisions will determine which policies are feasible to boost puerto rico ’s economic prospects – and thus how much it can pay its creditors .
at the center of any effort to resolve the debt crisis must be the understanding that just as today ’s debt restructuring affects puerto rico ’s future growth , puerto rico ’s future growth affects how much debt restructuring is needed .
with goodwill on all sides , real advantages can materialize from building up this informal grouping , as it is a gateway to the huge markets of southeast and northeast asia .
an economic bonus of such an effort for the entire region would come from the opening of direct flights and sea transport across the taiwan strait .
ceagpol could even become a building block for a northeast asian version of asean – an “ association of northeast asian nations . ”
as a result of historical suspicion between china , japan , and korea , northeast asia ’s economic heavyweights are the world ’s last remaining regional bloc that still lacks an inter-governmental organization of the likes of asean .
the european union is even more instructive , because centuries of war , culminating in the two world wars of the twentieth century , inspired , rather than deterred , european economic , political and security integration .
even in europe and the united states , officials in the higher level jobs usually earn much less than persons with comparable skills and responsibilities in the private sector .
in all nations , many government officials are highly dedicated and absolutely honest , but low pay does attract into government service some rotten apples who are willing to raise their incomes by accepting bribes and engaging in other corrupt practices .
even some honest officials may become disillusioned , and surrender to the many temptations to use illegal means so as to raise their incomes to levels they deem more appropriate to their responsibilities and training .
many years ago , the late economist george stigler , and i published an article that proposed a way to reduce malfeasance among government employees .
we suggested , among other things , that officials in vulnerable and important posts receive higher instead of lower salaries than comparable workers get in the private sector .
london – russia ’s invasion of ukraine and annexation of crimea have jeopardized global security and dominated the headlines .
but the current rules-based international system , which has been decades in the making , remains most seriously threatened by the civil war in syria .
not only are millions of lives in jeopardy ; the global framework of human rights and humanitarian law is on trial as well .
now these risks are in danger of being overshadowed by the crisis in ukraine , with confrontation in the united nations security council threatening to subordinate syria in the pecking order of international problems .
last month , on the third anniversary of the eruption of protests in damascus and other syrian cities , people around the world mobilized in street vigils and online as part of the “ with syria ” campaign .
this is true for its financial parameters too .
public and private contributions are combined in many ways .
to be sure , there is the additional feature that many higher education institutions have an endowment , which they can use to balance inequities .
it will take some time to build up such endowments in europe and elsewhere .
even so , the principle is surely right : universities must be set free .
but , rather than picking facts and stories to fit some grand narrative of decline or progress , we should try to compare across all areas of human existence to see if the world really is doing better or worse .
together with 21 of the world ’s top economists , i have tried to do just that , developing a scorecard spanning 150 years .
across ten areas – including health , education , war , gender , air pollution , climate change , and biodiversity – the economists all answered the same question : what was the relative cost of this problem in every year since 1900 , all the way to 2013 , with predictions to 2050 .
using classic economic valuations of everything from lost lives , bad health , and illiteracy to wetlands destruction and increased hurricane damage from global warming , the economists show how much each problem costs .
to estimate the magnitude of the problem , it is compared to the total resources available to fix it .
clearly , investment in food production must be increased in the medium and longer term .
but there is a policy prescription available to leaders today that could help remove supply-side obstacles : more trade .
this proposal may puzzle some , but the logic is straightforward and irrefutable .
trade is the transmission belt through which supply adjusts to demand .
it allows food to travel from lands of plenty to lands of little .
but the republicans ’ proposed tax reform is a bigger gift to corporations and the ultra-rich than most had anticipated .
it avoids necessary reforms and would leave the country with a mountain of debt ; the consequences – low investment , stalled productivity growth , and yawning inequality – would take decades to undo .
trump assumed office promising to “ drain the swamp ” in washington , dc .
instead , the swamp has grown wider and deeper .
with the republicans ’ proposed tax reform , it threatens to engulf the us economy .
yet finance can fail in many ways ; the lehman collapse is only one .
if this cycle is even approximately right , regulatory fatigue from battling to make finance safer will soon turn into regulatory confidence that the last war has now been won .
in a strong economy , finance will look stronger and existing regulation will appear to be effective .
it is common for people to update their views of the world with what they have last seen ; if what they last see is a strong economy and a stable financial system , they will conclude that they have stabilized the system .
the fed ’s 2008 transcripts reveal that its leaders saw such a world .
but , with the psychotic label already affixed to their files , whatever they did was assumed to be a symptom of their insanity .
at best , they would be declared to be “ in remission . ”
rosenhan ’s experiment suggests that questions about trump ’s mental health might never go away , no matter what steps he takes to change his detractors ’ minds .
even if he stops ranting on twitter or speaking in convoluted and incoherent sentences , at best he will be viewed as being “ in remission . ”
modern psychiatrists would argue that they have taken to heart the lessons of the rosenhan experiment , and now make diagnoses much more cautiously and rigorously .
boston – a resurgence of nativism and xenophobia in countries around the world has created a toxic environment for those fleeing from geopolitical crises .
but among the many challenges that refugees must confront while they await resettlement , finding access to high-quality physical and mental health care tops the list .
it is a challenge that demands more attention not just from doctors , nurses , non-governmental organizations , and other relevant actors , but also from engineers , who can make indispensable contributions to global public health .
those contributions are highly relevant to refugees .
beyond building bridges and creating gadgets , engineers can help improve the quality and affordability of health care around the world , by developing faster methods for diagnosing diseases and delivering medical services .
over the last 30 years , the prevailing ip regime has erected more barriers to the use of knowledge , often causing the gap between the social returns to innovation and the private returns to widen .
the powerful advanced-economy lobbies that have shaped that regime clearly put the latter first , reflected in their opposition to provisions recognizing intellectual property rights associated with traditional knowledge or biodiversity .
the widespread adoption of today ’s stringent ip protection is also historically unprecedented .
even among the early industrializers , ip protection came very late and often was deliberately eschewed to enable for quicker industrialization and growth .
the current ip regime is not sustainable .
during this era , the dollar strongly appreciated against major currencies and by 1985 was overvalued by virtually every measure .
throughout this period , the bundesbank sold dollars to curb the dollar 's appreciation ( figure 1c ) but the fed did not intervene at all ( figure 1b ) .
despite the advent of the european central bank , this asymmetry continues : while the ecb repeatedly tried to break the dollar 's appreciation in 2000-2001 through consecutive interventions in the foreign exchange market , the fed intervened only once .
this confirmed america 's interest in maintaining a strong dollar .
so long as these interests diverge , we should expect little coordination of foreign exchange policy between the two central banks .
in coming meetings of the g8 ( the world 's club of rich industrial countries plus russia ) , four members -- germany , france , italy , and the uk -- will participate both individually and as members of the european union , whose president also attends to represent the eu as a whole .
but should n't the eu have only a single representative ?
regardless of whether these meetings are productive , unitary eu participation would be of supreme symbolic value : it would affirm a common european stance in international relations and international economic policy .
the main argument in favor of such a change is that joint participation by the eu would increase europe 's weight in international relations , especially vis-a-vis the us .
after all , a key reason for european integration in the first place was precisely to provide a more powerful voice for europe in the international arena .
the idea behind a slippery slope is that if you do x , which is acceptable , you will end up doing y , which is not .
indeed , two types of slippery slopes – logical and sociological – exist .
on the logical slippery slope , you slide to the bottom and embrace the morally unacceptable because there is no way to distinguish it from an acceptable practice .
you can slide down the sociological slippery slope from one practice to the other – even if the two are conceptually different – just because the existence of one creates a social climate receptive to the other .
therapeutic cloning is conceptually distinct from reproductive cloning .
soon , devaluation in a nearby country reveals how vulnerable the economy is to the loss of international confidence .
suddenly , foreign creditors curtail short-term credit lines .
the central bank tries to hold the exchange rate , but eventually is forced to let the currency float .
the result is a currency collapse and a wave of bankruptcies .
the economy confronts its most severe economic crisis in many decades .
the world might not support the us in its unilateral attempts to become the world 's policeman , especially because they may well bring more instability .
nevertheless , it is important to realize why the us is undertaking them and that they respond to a core problem of today 's international order .
if russia and the other countries that opposed america 's iraq policy in the security council really wanted to convince the us not to attack iraq and to defend international law , it was a naive policy doomed to failure .
if we sought to preserve the un security council and the position of the present permanent members , then those actions were more likely to produce the opposite effect .
similarly , rearguard efforts to prove that those who opposed war in iraq were right and that the americans and the britons wrong , together with demands for `` proof '' that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction , are unconstructive and only cause mutual irritation .
some 8,000 refugees a day – a modern day volkerwanderung – are entering germany , partly because of harsh conditions back home , and partly because of germany ’s willingness to take them in .
the challenge of caring for , employing , and integrating such numbers will soon run up against the limits of physical capacity , financial resources , and public tolerance .
it is obvious that public policy can not succeed if it is focused on the consequences , rather than the causes , of the refugee crisis .
the change that would have the greatest positive impact would be the emergence of a new government in damascus that was acceptable to the bulk of the syrian people and a satisfactory partner for the united states and europe .
unfortunately , this seems likely to come about only with the blessing of russia and iran , both of which appear more inclined to increase their support for president bashar al-assad than to work for his removal .
israel also joined nato ’s naval control system in the mediterranean , contributing to operation active endeavor by joining nato forces in patrolling the mediterranean .
both sides seem eager to expand the scope of their partnership , with the objective of reaching a high level of interoperability .
recently , in anticipation of a hypothetical confrontation with iran , a major military maneuver – the juniper cobra exercise – was conducted to test israel ’s integration into us ballistic missile defenses .
american sources described the drill as “ the most complete air missile defense system we ’ve ever done anywhere in the world . ”
it was a major contribution , they said , to the development of a planned nato missile shield for europe .
it is difficult to see how the girls could be returned safely .
launching a military rescue operation would be highly risky .
it is believed that the girls have been split into separate groups , so that any attempt to rescue one group would imperil the others .
despite talk of the government negotiating a deal with the captors , this option , too , would be fraught with danger .
even if all of the girls eventually do come home , nothing will ever be the same again for them or their families .
the country played according to the “ rules ” of financial markets and managed to finalize the restructuring rapidly ; but the agreement was a bad one and did not help the economy recover .
three years later , greece is in desperate need of a new restructuring .
distressed debtors need a fresh start .
excessive penalties lead to negative-sum games , in which the debtor can not recover and creditors do not benefit from the larger repayment capacity that recovery would entail .
the absence of a rule of law for debt restructuring delays fresh starts and can lead to chaos .
we would expect to see a large number of illnesses among both employees and patients in hospitals where the victims are treated , and soon someone ( perhaps even a carrier who is not ill ) would spread it to ankara , istanbul , tbilisi , damascus , baghdad , and beyond .
the anti-flu drugs tamiflu and relenza are extremely expensive and in short supply .
history suggests that if we were to make these drugs available to poor countries for ring prophylaxis , they would often be administered improperly – such as in sub-optimal doses – in a way that would promote viral resistance and only intensify a pandemic .
or perhaps they would be sold on the black market to enrich corrupt government officials .
a politically incorrect but rational strategy would be for rich countries to devote resources to developing countries primarily for surveillance .
the best solution is to make western labor markets flexible by opening the system of collective wage bargaining , dismantling labor market regulation , and reforming the welfare state .
if workfare replaces welfare , wages will become more flexible enabling eu labor markets to absorb immigrants more efficiently .
but even with these measures , social benefits may artificially increase the incentive to migrate .
if immigrants gain welfare benefits in addition to wages , more will be lured into coming than necessary , and marginal migrants would create welfare losses for the eu equal to the benefits .
given that immigrants usually enter countries that redistribute resources from above-average to below-average incomes , such benefits are likely even if immigrants work and pay taxes and social security contributions .
president mahmoud abbas has made no secret of his objection to such a strategy .
but , with their government unable to do anything about the expansion of israeli settlements , including in east jerusalem , as well as continued conflicts over holy sites in hebron , bethlehem , and the al-aksa mosque , west bank palestinians are extremely frustrated .
recent street demonstrations could easily turn into an outbreak of ongoing resistance to israeli rule .
the palestinian authority , which runs the west bank , is afraid that a popular , non-violent intifada might quickly turn violent .
if so , israel might use it as a pretext to crush the palestinians and their newly built institutions .
li must ensure that china ’s economy , which still boasts significant growth potential , does not sink into lethargy and fall into the so-called “ middle-income trap . ”
a developing economy may slow prematurely when external factors alter the conditions supporting growth .
wages continue to rise , reducing competitiveness vis-à-vis low-income economies , but the growth model is not yet equipped to support competitiveness in high-skill industries , leading to stagnation .
in order to avoid such an outcome , li must adapt china ’s growth model to current conditions , which include intensifying trade friction with the european union and the united states , greater pressure to allow the renminbi to appreciate , an aging population , slowing urbanization , and rising labor costs .
the “ new normal ” that has emerged from the global financial crisis , characterized by sluggish gdp growth and diminished import demand in the west , makes reform even more urgent .
but , after nine years of conservative rule , moon will not be able simply to swoop in and implement his agenda .
in fact , with his democratic party holding only 40 % of the 299 seats in the national assembly , he will have to win support from centrist parties and even the conservative opposition .
moreover , he will need broader public backing .
to succeed , moon will have to reexamine carefully the effectiveness and feasibility of his campaign promises , identify the most promising measures , and avoid the most obvious pitfalls .
when it comes to public-sector job creation , for example , the main problem to consider is the long-term financial burden that such large-scale hiring could create .
commercial television programs aimed at children are replete with advertising for processed foods of dubious value to human health .
and , for every celebrity who donates time to fighting obesity , there are a dozen who accept large payments to hawk products , such as ultra-sugary drinks , that are arguably the tobacco of our generation .
it is hard for non-profits to compete with the production values embodied in beyoncé ’s pepsi commercial or taylor swift ’s diet coke commercial .
the causes of obesity are complex , and the science of understanding human behavior is embryonic ; but it is not hyperbole to call the problem an epidemic .
according to the centers for disease control and prevention , roughly 18 % of children aged 6-11 in the us are not just overweight , but obese .
but america today is on the back foot , economically and militarily .
new powers like china and india are rising , not risen , mixing assertiveness with emphasis on their continued “ developing ” status .
europe , where shared sovereignty has been embraced , is struggling to solve its own problems , never mind becoming a global player .
so no one is in charge .
this is all the more problematic at a time when the world ’s states and people are more intertwined than ever , as ideas , information , finance , migrants , and problems flow ever more seamlessly across borders .
and per capita gdp must surely be preferable to aggregate gdp .
no doubt , recovery in the uk began more slowly than in other g7 economies , except italy .
but there is also no doubt that the uk recovery picked up speed after 2012 .
last year , its growth rate was the highest in the g-7 .
according to the imf , only the us economy will grow faster over the next four years , with the uk then regaining the lead .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
in 1802 , america ’s third president , thomas jefferson , wrote that “ religion is a matter which lies solely between man & his god . ”
offering assurances to a group of connecticut baptists who feared for their religious liberty , he pointed out that the first amendment ’s establishment clause and free exercise clause built “ a wall of separation between church & state . ”
i have personally talked with more than 50 foreign leaders , and we all agree that only by coordinating our actions can we stop the devastation in west africa and halt ebola ’s spread .
we are making progress on both issues , but much work remains .
bringing together countries with competing interests and varying resources is hard work .
it demands intense diplomatic engagement and calls upon relationships that have been built and maintained over decades , as well as alliances with new partners .
but by overcoming differences and coordinating efforts to defeat the islamic state and conquer ebola , we are reinforcing support for a world order grounded in collective solutions to common problems .
consider the example of a subsidiary of a us corporation that earns profits in ireland .
that subsidiary pays the irish corporate tax at ireland ’s low 12 % rate .
it is then free to reinvest the after-tax profits in ireland , in financial securities , or in operating businesses anywhere in the world – except the us .
if the foreign subsidiary ’s parent company brings the after-tax profits back to the us to invest or distribute to its shareholders , it must pay the current us corporate tax rate of 35 % on its original pre-tax irish profits , with a credit for the 12 % that it has already paid .
because of this 23 % penalty on repatriation , us companies generally choose not to repatriate the profits of their foreign subsidiaries .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
the problem does not observe national borders , and thus requires collective global action .
but the transition to a carbon-neutral economy also offers far-reaching opportunities .
with the right strategy in place , europe can boost its own technological innovation and deploy carbon pricing and other fiscal policies to protect european labor markets from being undercut by lower-cost production in china and elsewhere .
moreover , through the european investment bank , the eu already has a tool for mobilizing massive stores of capital for investments in infrastructure , research and development , and other essential areas .
and , as adam tooze has argued , by issuing green bonds and other “ safe assets , ” europe can secure greater economic independence from other powers and start to establish the euro as a global currency .
partly in response to the soviet collapse , india embraced capitalism without reservation , which has produced spectacular economic progress .
and , like the economy , india ’s self-confidence has boomed .
india today sees that the wider world , particularly the west , regards it with growing respect , not only for the country ’s performance , but also for its essence – a young country and that is also an ancient civilization .
a little more than 60 years ago , india remained the crown jewel of the british empire .
fifty years ago , if you sought to read about india in the west , you would mostly find books about spirituality .
a careful analysis of merkel ’s words shows that she was not questioning the future of the transatlantic alliance .
rather , she was calling for a stronger europe .
merkel knows that if the us sacrifices its place at the top of the international order for domestic political reasons , it will not be replaced by a new leading power , nor will a new world order emerge .
what we will have is a power vacuum , marked by chaos .
and as the world becomes less stable , we europeans will have no choice but to come together to defend our interests .
the point is that questions such as , " are we creating too much inequality ? " can not even be asked in china .
the upshot is that whenever a problem gets out of hand , the turnaround comes too late and is dramatic .
this is why china can not shelve the problem of its transition to democracy .
democracy is not only a mechanism to help prevent strategic mistakes .
there is a more mundane reason why many , even within the party , think that a democratic transition has become inevitable : the party is simply losing control of the country .
indeed , a number of interesting practical moves in this direction are underway , though not all of them pursue the original regional course set by their founders .
the economic community of west african states ( ecowas ) , for example , has unexpectedly demonstrated both the will and the capacity to raise a fighting force to intervene in regional conflicts , such as the awful civil war in sierra leone .
less spectacularly , but perhaps more important in the long run , ecowas is laying the groundwork for regional economic integration , with the creation of a single currency now a stated objective .
in southern africa , the southern african development community , after a shaky start , is pushing ahead with joint projects , of which transport infrastructure , a blight on much intra-african commerce , is a central theme .
east african countries are also pushing integration projects ahead , and appear to have learned from past failures in the region , which were the result of hastily constructed , inappropriate , and overly ambitious structures .
so where is this demand-driven growth ?
the european central bank ( ecb ) seems more interested in keeping interest rates high enough to force insolvent firms into bankruptcy than in promoting higher employment .
with private-sector demand stalling , the employment commission wants the government to serve as employer of last resort .
but the maastricht treaty 's stability and growth pact limits fiscal deficits to 3 % of gdp - a ceiling that germany is already hitting .
unless a future government is bold enough to violate the pact with abandon , its only alternative will be to increase taxes , which would merely prolong the very downturn in private-sector demand that has kept unemployment high .
new york – in his remarkable apology to the catholics of ireland ( most of that country ’s population ) , pope benedict xvi explained why he thought sinful priests were tempted to commit sexual acts with children .
it was because of “ new and serious challenges to the faith arising from the rapid transformation and secularization of irish society .
fast-paced social change has occurred , often adversely affecting people ’s traditional adherence to catholic teaching and values . ”
as we know , the abuse of children by catholic priests did not just occur in ireland , but in many other countries too , something the pope preferred not to dwell upon .
and ireland is not the only place where social transformation and secularization have challenged religious values .
last august , the israelis permitted an additional seven battalions and 20 tanks in zone c. but the egyptian armed forces never brought in the full number of additional troops , and did not even bother to transport the tanks across the suez canal .
egypt ’s approach toward sinai troop deployments reflects its traditional neglect of the peninsula .
historically , it has deployed only 70-80 % of the 22,000 soldiers that the treaty allows in zone a. and the military has never established a regional command in sinai , preferring to allow units temporarily stationed there to report to their superiors scattered around cairo and its environs .
egypt ’s new islamist leaders may want to restore “ full sovereignty ” over the peninsula , as president mohamed morsi ’s legal adviser , mohamed fouad gadalla , recently noted .
such saber-rattling comments vis-à-vis israel are currently popular in the country .
their home page shows a smiling young manager based in chile , and the company is pushing to enlist women in the palestinian territories – not for ideological reasons but because there are so many talented programmers there to hire .
“ thirty percent of women in many countries in the middle east have university degrees , ” zaleski explains , but they often can not get jobs commensurate with their training for cultural reasons .
with powertofly ’s technological ability to transcend cultural barriers , a woman can contribute at the highest levels to an american company – even if local laws prohibit her from driving a car .
not surprisingly , given such a model , many men want to participate as well .
the founders do not rule out eventually expanding to address that need .
so here are ten good reasons to believe in europe – ten rational arguments to convince pessimistic analysts , and worried investors alike , that it is highly premature to bury the euro and the eu altogether .
the first reason for hope is that statesmanship is returning to europe , even if in homeopathic doses .
it is too early to predict the impact of françois hollande ’s election as president of france .
but , in italy , one man , mario monti , is already making a difference .
of course , no one elected monti , and his position is fragile and already contested , but there is a positive near-consensus that has allowed him to launch long-overdue structural reforms .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
many of these decisions turned out badly , largely because information technology ( computers and how they are used ) eliminated many middle-class jobs .
increasing globalization of trade also did not help in this regard .
in addition , as till von wachter of columbia university has documented , prolonged periods of unemployment for parents have a severe and lasting negative impact on their children .
children whose families can not provide a decent start in life deserve help .
but america has not provided it – a point recently made by jeb bush , a leading contender for the republican presidential nomination in 2016 .
in most european countries , action to spur private investment in local services and transport – both large sectors – should also be considered .
governments , however , need to understand the barriers to investment : regulatory failures ; weak enablers , including financial and human capital ; poor infrastructure ; and substandard technology .
and they must undertake rigorous cost-benefit analyses , in order to ensure that any intervention translates into private investment that promotes productivity growth .
it is here – at the level of execution – that governments often perform poorly .
too often , they spend money to support private-sector projects that fail to provide a positive return for the broader economy .
here is where the connection between food and climate change comes in : as people climb out of poverty – as many are – they demand more meat and dairy .
this trend has grave implications for agriculture ’s ecological footprint .
animals consume more food than they produce .
cows release large volumes of heat-trapping methane .
and clearing land for pasture releases carbon dioxide at a staggering rate .
the african development bank ( afdb ) , the presidency of which i am currently seeking , has a far more expansive mandate .
but all of these institutions share an overarching goal : to lift people out of poverty and foster sustainable development .
leaders of these organizations must make complicated choices in allocating their finite resources .
for example , they must balance the battle against poverty and hunger against efforts to improve gender equality , increase access to education , or tackle corruption .
having served as sierra leone ’s finance minister , central bank governor , and now foreign minister , i have worked for many years with international organizations to manage these competing priorities as i oversaw the economic revitalization of my own post-conflict state .
berlin – europe ’s established left is facing the threat of extinction .
in less than two years , the continent ’s social-democratic parties have suffered historic losses in france , the netherlands , germany , and italy .
on a continent long defined by democratic competition between center-right and center-left parties , the collapse of the left could have far-reaching consequences , beyond particular party interests .
many factors underlie the left ’s decline , including the dissolution of the traditional working class .
but one of the most important reasons is as grim as it is simple : european voters are increasingly opposed to immigration , and do not trust the left to limit it .
the us is expected to become energy self-sufficient in 2020 , and to become an oil exporter by 2030 .
this scenario would grant the us three enormous advantages .
it would enhance us economic competitiveness , especially relative to europe , given the lower costs involved in the extraction of shale gas .
it would also reduce america ’s exposure to growing unrest in the arab world .
finally , it would increase the relative vulnerability of america ’s main strategic rival , china , which is becoming increasingly dependent on middle east energy supplies .
the gap between their objective analysis of reality and government policies has become a chasm .
in most western countries , for example , economists have long known about the growing divide in terms of incomes and other indicators between some affluent cities – which benefit from globalization – and the rest of the country .
yet not until french president emmanuel macron ’s administration did a national leader enact tax cuts on the basis of where one lives .
as a result , 1 % of france ’s gdp is now being redistributed first to the poorest parts of the country .
traditional parties could also learn something from listening to voters directly , rather than only through the filters of media and pollsters .
how many lives is that worth ?
let ’s suppose that the experience of visiting or recalling notre dame makes people about twice as happy as they would otherwise be over that time period , which means , in effect , an extra hour spent in notre dame , or in recalling one ’s visit , is as good as extending someone ’s life by an hour .
suppose we ’re saving lives of people who would live 60 more years , the 9,000 years of annual benefit is equivalent to saving 150 lives per year .
that ’s a significant number of lives , but now we must ask how many lives € 1 billion could save .
whatever the gilets jaunes may advocate , it ’s obvious that we could save more lives , and reduce more economic hardship , by helping people in extreme poverty in low-income countries than we could by spending it in france .
in fact , some see germany ’s renewed commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 , in order to achieve the goals of the 2015 paris climate agreement , as a battering ram against the schwarze null .
on september 20 , the german government announced some € 54 billion ( $ 59.4 billion ) worth of spending measures to cut emissions .
in the us , such a package would be called a green new deal .
spending on such priorities as energy and the environment can be useful .
but getting serious about co2 emissions and other environmental goals does n’t have to mean larger budget deficits .
any economist who appears to question the benefits of trade openness risks banishment , so let me be clear : i do not question the standard version of the gains-from-trade theory , but the extravagant , unsubstantiated claims made about the consequences of openness .
for the latter endangers broad public acceptance of the real article because it unleashes expectations unlikely to be fulfilled .
in the real world , opening up is not a simple matter of revising tariff codes and removing barriers to foreign investment .
it requires a heavy dose of institutional reform , which consumes financial , bureaucratic , and political resources .
while many institutional reforms are development-friendly , they may not be targeted at key developmental goals - growth , improved governance , industrial and technological capability , poverty alleviation - and occasionally divert attention from them .
but , as the examples cited above reveal , seas are not fulfilling their purpose reliably .
this is because , as it stands , technical specialists typically conduct seas at the behest of project developers – a practice that , as activists have repeatedly pointed out , is grossly unethical .
with the assessors frequently basing their conclusions on only a superficial appraisal of the ecological and market value of the affected ecosystems , it should be no surprise that damaging projects are often approved , despite failing to adhere to broadly agreed green development guidelines .
to play an effective role in protecting the planet and its people , seas must be rigorous , credible , and transparent .
this means that they must be conducted by well-regulated , impartial professionals .
but there are signs that these assumptions are now being challenged .
prior to the crisis , regulatory authorities focused mainly on removing barriers to trading , and generally favored measures that made markets more complete by fostering faster , cheaper trading of a wider variety of financial claims .
that is no longer the case .
on the contrary , nowadays many are questioning the assumption that greater market efficiency is always and everywhere a public good .
might such ease and efficiency not also fuel market instability , and serve the interests of intermediaries rather than their clients ?
following strenuous international protests over chen ’s kidnapping , the fpc decided to investigate .
xinhua announced that local officials responsible for the violence might be prosecuted .
central authorities seemed to sense an immediate need to quell criticism of its controversial population-control efforts .
and xinhua wasted no time in claiming that the abuses were limited to a few towns .
however , central government authorities have done little to halt intimidation of linyi ’s villagers .
tighter us monetary policy could intensify the global credit shortage , thereby increasing pressure on asia ’s economic and financial systems .
overreaction and herding behavior by market participants could trigger a sudden reversal of capital inflows , with a severe dollar shortage – as occurred in 1997 and 2008 – straining asian banks and corporations .
these risks explain why the fed ’s mere suggestion of a potential move toward reducing its purchases of long-term asset ( so-called quantitative easing ) caused emerging-market currencies and asset prices to plummet this summer .
they also underscore asian economies ’ need for stronger financial safety nets .
the 2008 global financial crisis revealed fundamental flaws in the international monetary system , as the failure to ensure sufficient liquidity weighed heavily on emerging asian economies .
for many russians , if not most , the authority figure embodies the powers that control everything that matters in life ; they support him , regardless of the policies that he implements , because there is no possibility of doing otherwise .
this partly explains enduring popular devotion to rulers like joseph stalin .
the question today is not about the outcome of next year ’s presidential election ; that has already been determined .
with the presidential term now extended to six years , we can expect an encore lasting up to 12 years – longer than putin ’s original performance .
but now the delusional and ignorant want to believe that putin will become a reformer this time around .
the old regime ’s adherents can more easily trick the newcomers into dangerous compromises if the process is exceedingly fast .
the other major shortcoming was that the leader of the orange revolution , viktor yushchenko , turned out to be a feckless and irresponsible president .
initially , he traveled the world for months to celebrate his victory , ignoring the chaos back home .
then he began vetoing virtually all decisions by the government , causing a political stalemate , and , toward the end of his presidency , tacitly joined with the old guard ( now back in power ) against then-prime minister yuliya tymoshenko ( whose party , to its credit , had voted against the constitution ) .
but , while yushchenko serves as a warning to russians not to elect an accidental president with excessive powers , an underlying cause of the orange government ’s breakdown was that most of its ministers ( yushchenko appointees ) were defectors from the old regime .
indian-style socialism was a compound of nationalism and idealism .
it embodied the conviction that goods and services vital to indians ’ economic well-being must remain in indian hands – and not in the hands of indians seeking to profit from producing and selling such goods and services , but rather in the disinterested hands of the state , the father and mother to all indians .
given this mindset , performance was not a relevant criterion for judging the utility of the public sector .
inefficiencies were masked by generous subsidies from the national treasury , and a combination of vested interests – socialist ideologues , bureaucratic managers , trade unions , and monopolies – kept it beyond political criticism .
the “ permit-license-quota ” culture of statist socialism allowed politicians and bureaucrats to use public service as a vehicle for private gratification , giving birth to a culture of corruption that still persists .
for organizations without the clout – and digital revenue – of the times , a people-oriented approach may also be needed to secure investment .
with the limits of the ad-driven business model becoming increasingly apparent , many media leaders – close to one-third , according to the reuters institute survey – believe that in the future foundations and non-profits will play a central role in supporting the media .
but persuading foundations and philanthropists to open their hearts and wallets will require human connection and engagement , not algorithms or ai-enabled software .
potential funders need to be convinced that journalism is as noble a cause as , say , cancer research .
technology alone can not encourage democracy , help answer important questions , and facilitate effective leadership by boosting accountability .
with europe politically and geographically divided , italy ’s politics could tip the balance .
a pro-eu italy governed by an m5s-democrat coalition could join with france and germany to reform the eu ; regain a clear foreign-policy voice for eu vis-à-vis the us , russia , and china ; and implement a strategy for green , innovation-based growth .
to forge such a coalition , the m5s would have to adopt a responsible and clearly defined economic program , and the democrats would have to accept being the junior partner of an untested insurgent force .
a possible key to mutual confidence would be for the democrats to hold the crucial finance ministry , while m5s appoints the prime minister .
it is not surprising that us president donald trump ’s utterly reckless former adviser , stephen bannon , rushed to italy to encourage m5s and the league to form a coalition that he called the “ ultimate dream , ” because it would break the eu .
my statements were also motivated by problems with the way capital punishment is imposed in india .
the supreme court has declared that the death penalty should be applied only in the “ rarest of the rare ” cases .
and , indeed , the last three executions in the country stemmed from terrorist offenses that threatened or took a large number of lives .
but the decision to impose capital punishment remains highly subjective .
indeed , whether the death penalty is meted out depends on a number of variables , beginning with judicial and social biases .
and the average hourly wages for all employees on private non-farm payrolls posted an annual increase of 2.5 % in october , the biggest since 2009 .
as the fed slowly raises interest rates , those middle-class families holding their hard-earned savings at the bank will finally start realizing some return on their deposits .
the long-term effects should not be underestimated , given the helpful impact of compound savings .
during the last tightening cycle between 2004 and 2006 , households ’ interest income rose 29 % .
although this time , the gains presumably will be smaller and slower to arrive , owing to the likely pace and extent of fed tightening , interest paid on savings will move household income in the right direction : up .
beijing – most western media have characterized the recent 19th national congress of the communist party of china ( cpc ) as a pure power play , with president xi jinping entrenching his position .
but the accumulation of political capital in this case is a means to an end .
for xi , that end is a smooth transition into modernity that cements the cpc ’s long-term authority and ensures his own legacy as modern china ’s most significant leader .
xi knows that if china is to continue to thrive in a fast-changing world , he will need to manage deftly a major social and economic transformation , while , even more important , improving state governance .
and , in order to secure the long-term survival of china ’s one-party system , he must reform state and party institutions ; indeed , political reform is , for xi , a prerequisite for economic reform .
another question is how much of the revenues should be transferred , and how transfers can be effected in a country as large , complex , and financially backward as nigeria .
but even with all the difficulties of corruption and inefficiency that will no doubt plague its actual implementation , our proposal is superior to the status quo .
after all , today 's terrible conditions are the result of staggering corruption and waste over the last 40 years .
at best , our proposal could fundamentally improve the quality of public institutions and thus transform economics and politics in nigeria for decades to come .
the time to act is now .
the instability of financial markets can cause serious economic and social dislocations .
the question poses itself : what should be done to preserve the financial system ’s stability ?
this can not be answered in the abstract , because every situation is different .
financial markets are best understood as a historical process , and history never quite repeats itself .
recent turmoil in asian markets raises difficult questions about currency pegs , asset bubbles , inadequate banking supervision , and the lack of financial information which can not be ignored .
screening travelers from affected regions may have prevented significant epidemics elsewhere .
health officials around the world should maintain their vigilance and prepare for the possibility that renewed control efforts will be required if sars resurges .
indeed , the experience with sars in toronto , where cases escaped detection and led to a second outbreak , stands as a warning against excessive optimism about the apparent control of the larger and more geographically dispersed outbreaks in taiwan and mainland china .
these epidemics may , in fact , be eliminated entirely in coming months .
but it is at least as likely that some transmission will persist , or that the virus will be reintroduced into human populations from animals .
the bush administration ’s recent decision to initiate a parallel anti-corruption process through the g-8 leaves the united states outside the premier international forum for addressing transparency in resource revenues while unnecessarily reinventing the wheel in the process .
nor have the us and britain used their power in iraq to promote transparency in the oil sector .
let us hope that the new iraqi government does better .
it is difficult to see how democracy can take root if the country ’s most important source of income remains as veiled in secrecy as it was under saddam .
the eiti still has a long way to go , but it is one of the most effective vehicles available for achieving a global standard of disclosure and accountability .
there are more united nations resolutions devoted to human rights abuses committed by israel than to abuses by all other countries combined .
stories about israel focus almost exclusively on the palestinian conflict .
joyce karam , the washington bureau chief of the pan-arab newspaper al-hayat , believes that this is because “ muslim killing muslim or arab killing arab seems more acceptable than israel killing arabs . ”
syrian , libyan , and yemenite victims are faceless ; the lionization of the incomparably fewer gazan casualties makes them unique .
this is not to say that israel should be consoled by the macabre arithmetic of bloodshed .
even the imf now recognizes that capital market liberalization has delivered neither growth nor stability to many developing countries .
yet , whether driven by narrow ideology or responding to the demands of special interests , the bush administration is still demanding an extreme form of such liberalization in its bilateral trade agreements .
the second issue concerns the unbalanced intellectual property provisions ( trips ) of the uruguay round of trade talks , dictated by america 's pharmaceutical and entertainment industries .
these provisions restricted countries from making generic imitations of drugs , making many critically important medicines unaffordable in developing countries .
spearheaded by worries about aids , activists around the world demanded that something be done .
now that the cap is coming into force , we will soon benefit from the extraordinary effects of a new , permanent global health dividend .
we can expect to see data in the coming years indicating reduced health-care costs and improved educational outcomes from around the world .
in the meantime , governments will be collaborating on additional measures to reduce the environmental and climate impact of the global maritime trade system .
such efforts are essential to reach the targets outlined in the 2015 paris climate agreement .
as matters stand , the shipping sector , ranked alongside countries , is the world ’s sixth-largest greenhouse-gas ( ghg ) emitter .
cambridge – the united states is famous for its ability to innovate .
aspiring fiscal conservatives around the world thus might be interested in learning four tricks that american politicians commonly use when promising to cut taxes while simultaneously reducing budget deficits .
these are hard promises to keep , for the simple reason that a budget deficit equals government spending minus tax revenue .
but , each of the four tricks has been refined over three decades .
indeed , they first acquired their colorful names in the early years of ronald reagan ’s presidency : the “ magic asterisk , ” the “ rosy scenario , ” the laffer hypothesis , and the “ starve the beast ” scenario .
so which is it : are banks still at risk ?
or has post-crisis regulatory reform done its job ?
the 2008 financial crisis highlighted two dangerous features of today ’s financial system .
first , governments will bail out the largest banks rather than let them collapse and damage the economy .
second , and worse , being too big to fail helps large banks grow even larger , as creditors and trading partners prefer to work with banks that have an implicit government guarantee .
although it is not yet possible to predict the outcome of the arab spring , the alliance proved its ability to act wisely in libya , thereby improving its image in north africa .
in chicago , nato will agree on a major political declaration offering further support for the region , on the condition that the region ’s countries request it .
the participants in chicago will have major differences over these issues , and the results may not be ideal .
but reinventing nato is a long-term process , and will necessarily occur in small steps .
the alliance ’s main goal must be to ensure that they are steps forward .
argentina ’s new president-elect , mauricio macri , an engineer by training , is often described in the international press as “ center-right . ”
but that label is not quite correct .
in argentina , the left-right divide has been blurred by the policies of the hydra-headed perónist justicialist party , which privatized state companies in the 1990s , only to re-nationalize them later .
moreover , “ center-right ” often means “ conservative , ” and macri ’s victory will not “ conserve ” the status quo .
macri is best described as a “ liberal ” – in the european sense of the word .
women who have an abnormal brca1 or brca2 gene run a lifetime risk of up to 85 % of developing breast cancer , while the increased risk of developing ovarian cancer is about 55 % for women with brca1 mutations and about 25 % for women with brca2 mutations .
most recently , huge studies analyzing effects of single nucleotide variations in genomic dna , so-called single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snp ) , on breast cancer risk of brca1/brca2 mutation carriers have identified so-called modifier snp that can decrease or increase the individual lifetime risk .
we have also learned that only 20-40 % of the breast cancers that cluster in families come from brca1 or brca2 germline mutations – genetic alterations that are present from birth in every cell of the body and can be transmitted to the offspring .
increased breast cancer risk is also known to be associated with several inherited syndromes , such as li-fraumeni syndrome , a condition that is further associated with childhood onset of multiple malignancies including soft tissue sarcomas , leukemias , and brain tumors .
in most cases of familial breast cancer , however , genetic predisposition remains elusive .
xi ’s government is struggling to maintain domestic stability as it moves china away from labor-intensive , investment-heavy economic growth toward a model based on domestic consumption and services .
the primacy of this domestic agenda means that china ’s attempt to lead global change will lack a clear vision and coherent strategy .
a second problem stems from china ’s incomplete transition on the world stage .
after prevailing in world war ii , the us immediately and undeniably dominated the globe .
china , in seeking to lead the next stage of economic globalization , enjoys no such geopolitical power and legitimacy .
our commitment to tackling climate change is based on an understanding of the enormous health risks and costs that arise from inaction .
costa rica devotes significant resources to tackling problems like dengue fever and malaria because our people remain our most important asset .
and staying below the 1.5 ° c limit will mean 3.3 million fewer cases of dengue fever annually in latin america and the caribbean , fewer people at risk of malaria , and less food instability and poor nutrition caused by higher temperatures and unstable weather patterns .
costa rica is proud to be leading the world by putting this approach into practice .
as a result , we are one of the few countries ready to exceed our commitments under the paris climate agreement .
promote china ’s traditional civilization with strengthened spiritual ties .
there is now real hope that talks along these lines can succeed .
but there is a major obstacle to easing tensions : the proposed $ 6.5 billion sale by the united states to taiwan of 30 apache attack helicopters and 330 patriot missiles .
china-us talks on defense cooperation had earlier stalled because of such arms negotiations .
they have since been restarted , an olive branch sent to the obama administration by china ’s government .
speaking at the european parliament in brussels in april 2017 , ceu president and rector michael ignatieff could say , “ i have support in washington .
i have support in berlin , i have support in budapest , [ … ] i have got support in munich .
it is now time to get some support in brussels . ”
and ignatieff did get some backing , at least initially .
in december 2017 , the european commission took hungary to the european court of justice ( ecj ) over the government ’s so-called “ ceu law , ” which the university said was intended to force it out of the country .
most chinese doctors and patients have , for example , long regarded acupuncture as an effective treatment for stroke , using it to improve motor , speech , and other functions that have been destroyed .
one survey showed that 66 % of chinese doctors use acupuncture routinely to treat the effects of stroke , with 63 % of the doctors surveyed believing it to be effective .
some 36 % of chinese doctors think the effectiveness of acupuncture remains uncertain , perhaps because the scientific basis for it remains so new .
recently , however , systematic scientific studies of acupuncture ’s effects in such treatment has begun .
almost all trials on acupuncture as a treatment for stroke conducted within china have been positive .
even after years of quantitative easing ( qe ) and ultra-low interest rates , central bankers in the advanced economies – particularly the eurozone – have continued to undershoot their inflation targets .
economists have also had to question long-held assumptions about downward nominal wage rigidity , an artifact of the 1960-70s , when organized labor was much stronger .
clearly , the idea that employees will always resist cutting wages ( or workers ’ hours ) no longer applies .
in fact , the declining power of labor may explain why the phillips curve no longer seems to hold true .
but , even more important , it could be the reason why measured productivity remains persistently weak .
but there need not be a trade-off between inequality and growth .
governments can enhance growth by increasing inclusiveness .
a country ’s most valuable resource is its people .
so it is essential to ensure that everyone can live up to their potential , which requires educational opportunities for all .
a modern economy also requires risk-taking .
this haughty attitude is reflected in the jargon of “ consenting a patient ” – as though it were something done to a patient , like drawing blood or administering an injection : “ dr. smith , please go consent mr. jones . ”
instead , consent should be viewed as a patient ’s cherished possession , which he or she may choose to relinquish , if presented with a sufficiently compelling case .
consent should not be snatched away , like a train ticket held out for the conductor .
the problem is compounded when consent is obtained just hours before a major operation , and months after the last consultation with the surgeon .
this can lead patients to consent to procedures that they do not understand – or want .
those with sought-after talents have more bargaining power , are better able to manage their careers , and command higher salaries .
those without in-demand skills are struggling and feel disposable .
so far , this abundance of choice has discouraged companies from spending resources on training employees , who might , after all , soon decide to join a competitor .
however , as talent shortages loom , the need to retain employees could tip the balance back toward greater investment in professional development .
employers that provide learning opportunities will become a destination for talent .
similar to traditional military command-and-control protocols , they gain power in numbers and can quickly react to a broad array of attacks .
such a digital ecosystem strengthens checks and balances , reducing the possibility of failure and mitigating the effects of an incursion .
in such a future scenario , a hollywood blockbuster might be about networks of computers fighting each other , while humans stand by .
it would portray the broader idea of “ singularity , ” a hypothetical turning point when the artificial surpasses the human .
fortunately , in this case , life is still far from imitating art .
on march 6 , i received six recommendations from the members of “ science20 , ” which was created by the national science academies of the g20 countries .
in order to reduce threats to marine ecosystems and conserve marine environments , the final two recommendations urge the “ establishment of an improved data storage and management system that ensures open access by scientists globally , ” and the “ sharing of information gained through research activities carried out under extensive and multinational collaboration , to expedite a comprehensive understanding of the global ocean and its dynamics . ”
it is precisely for this reason that we must ensure dfft and turn data into public goods for scientists worldwide .
the g20 summit in osaka is coming at the dawn of a new era – reiwa ( “ beautiful harmony ” ) – in japan .
on april 30 the world witnessed the abdication by his majesty the emperor emeritus akihito , the first abdication by a reigning emperor in 202 years .
by investing in “ smart ” and “ resilient ” urban planning , governments from bordeaux in france to curitiba in brazil are strengthening their brand identities and luring talent , investment , and businesses from around the world .
the american-canadian author and urban activist jane jacobs famously observed that cities are the true engines of national prosperity .
cities power growth through innovation , trade , and exchange .
and city services are often more visible to citizens than federal aid ; consider , for example , who responds during a traffic accident or a natural disaster .
to be sure , today ’s cities face many challenges .
the danger is not just that economic rivalry , protectionism , and trade restrictions would threaten global prosperity ; it is that these developments also would raise the risk of a serious political confrontation .
technological sovereignty would take the place of trade and exchange , and the nationality of corporations – even major multinationals – would become just as important as their business model .
still , it would be a mistake to conclude that this whole conflict was brought on solely by trump and his neo-nationalist agenda .
two days after google announced its decision , the new york times published a commentary by thomas l. friedman , author of the world is flat , echoing many of trump ’s attacks on china ’s unfair trade practices .
if that is where the previous ideological high priest of globalization now stands , china is facing off against not just trump ’s america , but liberal america , too .
in a small-state setting , imposition of a dense network of controls is likely to lead to the loss of mobile factors of production , while in a large state it is harder for labor or capital to escape .
on the international stage , large states try to make international rules , and often build their domestic legitimacy on their claims to be able to shape a larger world : they think in terms of what french thinkers call “ harnessing globalization . ”
instead of accepting the international system roughly as it is , with all its imperfections , they think that they can use their weight to alter the rules – in their favor .
small states ’ nervousness and fear began to increase roughly in 2000 .
the new political realities were highlighted by the iraq war , china ’s search for energy sources in developing countries , and russia ’s assertiveness in foreign and domestic policy .
democratic legitimacy won a major battle over social legitimacy .
this opens the way to more and deeper reforms .
a law restricting transport strikes took effect on january 1 , and sarkozy intends to break the 35-hour workweek , albeit indirectly .
instead of repealing the law , overtime work is to become easy and relatively cheap .
he is also preparing to raise the retirement age to 61 , from 60 .
with the exception of the united kingdom , the extreme free-market view gained less traction in europe in recent decades than it did in the us ; nonetheless , the challenge of implementing financial reforms in the eurozone is actually more difficult .
governments regard domestic banks as important buyers of sovereign debt .
the banks argue that more effective regulation would limit credit and slow the pace of economic recovery .
as a result , the authorities in germany and france ( as well as japan ) have consistently resisted increasing capital requirements , despite widespread agreement that doing so is an essential part of effective re-regulation .
their opposition has undermined international efforts to build a more resilient system – and it will likely hamper efforts to put the european economy on a sounder footing .
this reflects a fundamental conflict between thatcherism and trumpism : the latter aims to sweep away the neoliberal consensus of unregulated markets , privatization , free trade , and immigration that comprised the former .
but , even if the ideas are different , the tactics are the same .
to consolidate support , thatcher would go head-to-head with carefully selected enemies – from british miners to argentina ’s president , general leopoldo galtieri , to the bureaucrats in brussels .
similarly , as the hudson institute ’s craig kennedy recently told me , “ bannon wants to radicalize the anti-trump liberals into fighting for causes which alienate them from mainstream america . ”
every time trump ’s opponents march for women , muslims , or sexual minorities , they fortify trump ’s core support base .
young democracies can be cruel : their voters are often as unforgiving as political opponents .
the two weeks since taiwan 's disputed presidential election of march 20 - only the third such democratic vote in the country 's history - has tested this truism almost to the breaking point .
taiwan 's young democracy must now cope with the balancing act that president chen shui-bian 's re-election has thrust upon it .
while canvassing for votes in his hometown in southern taiwan on the eve of the election , president chen and vice president annette lu were both wounded by an assassin 's bullet .
the sympathy this secured gave the president his razor-thin margin of victory - with just 50.1 % of the votes - over lien chan , the candidate of the kuomintang party and people 's first party ( kmt-pfp ) coalition .
in this respect , the current effort to prop up the syrian government counts as a twofer .
but raising russian living standards remains central to putin ’s grip on power and his long-term legacy .
even before intervening in ukraine , putin was failing to deliver on his grand promise , made in 2003 , to double the size of russia ’s economy within a decade .
in terms of nominal per capita gdp , russia still fares little better than mexico .
signature efforts to diversify and modernize the economy failed , because disruptive technologies and business strategies can not be decreed from the top .
cambridge – greek prime minister alexis tsipras has the chance to become to his country what south korean president kim dae-jung and brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva were to theirs : a man of the left who moves toward fiscal responsibility and freer markets .
like tsipras , both were elected in the midst of an economic crisis .
both immediately confronted the international financial constraints that opposition politicians can afford to ignore .
on assuming power , kim and lula were able to adjust , politically and mentally , to the new realities that confronted them , launching much-needed reforms .
some reforms were “ conservative ” ( or “ neo-liberal ” ) and might not have been possible under politicians of the right .
annual economic growth in the state averaged more than 10 % from 2006 to 2012 , when the gujarati city of ahmedabad was short-listed for the lee kuan yew world city prize .
but history haunts modi ’s campaign – namely , the deaths of more than 1,000 people in anti-muslim riots in gujarat in 2002 .
though the supreme court cleared him of all personal wrongdoing , the tragedy ’s legacy persists , making it difficult for modi to win muslim votes without alienating his hindu nationalist base .
this has not prevented modi from taking political risks , beginning with his assertion that india needs toilets more than temples .
but his decision to run for prime minister is by far his riskiest move , as it will test his national appeal .
xi ’s anti-corruption campaign ca n’t overcome this resistance ; instead , it is merely discouraging initiative .
on a recent visit to beijing , a chinese economist told me that xi ’s campaign cost china 1 % of gdp per year .
a chinese businessman told me real growth was less than half the official figure .
perhaps this can be countered by the private sector ’s dynamism , but even there , fear of losing of control is increasing the party ’s role .
finally , there is china ’s soft-power deficit .
in the meantime , turkey and the united states have a mutual interest in working together in iraq , syria , and iran .
but , as turkey builds closer relations with the us , and its competition with iran stiffens in both iraq and syria , it will also have to deal with a more assertive russia , which is eager to prove itself in the middle east and eastern mediterranean – and to maintain its foothold in syria .
for better or worse , the status quo in the middle east has unraveled , and turkey must reassess and recalibrate its regional policies .
turkey ’s real strengths are its flourishing economy , secular democratic system , and ability to mediate between its western allies and a region that is struggling to join the mainstream of the twenty-first century .
how turkey navigates the syrian debacle will determine its position in the broader transformation of its neighborhood .
these remedies have reduced the rate of new infections ( though the total number of people living with hiv , especially aged 15-49 , continues to rise ) .
with almost two million patients now on antiretroviral treatment , annual aids-related deaths have fallen by around 100,000 since 2005 .
contagion among newborn babies , once running at around 70,000 per year , have been cut by some 63 % , and the lives of millions of hiv/aids sufferers have been prolonged .
another important factor has been better integration of treatment plans .
the government has aligned its early antiretroviral treatment programs for existing sufferers , initiated in 2008 , with early monitoring programs for pregnant women .
but this can happen only if nature ’s cornucopia is conserved , so that current and future generations of researchers can make new discoveries that benefit patients everywhere .
consider the polar bear , threatened with extinction in the wild by climate change .
these mammals spend up to seven months of the year hibernating , during which time they are essentially immobile .
a human would lose a third or more of bone mass when immobile for this period of time .
astonishingly , hibernating bears lay down new bone , by producing a substance that inhibits cells that break down bone and promotes those that produce bone and cartilage .
but they need stronger support – not just in the air or with weapons and training , but also from western special forces .
there is a strong argument , too , for nato to recognize that one of its members , france , has been attacked , thereby activating article 5 of the north atlantic treaty , which ensures mutual defense .
the entire alliance should commit itself to the defeat of terrorism .
yet this is not only europe ’s fight , or that of the united states .
this is about global order in a stable and prosperous world .
now , the eu is at the center of domestic political debates , which increasingly include existential questions about the survival of the eurozone and the entire european project .
this means that candidates in next year ’s election are unlikely just to focus on domestic issues .
while there will be some of that , there is likely also to be , for the first time , extensive discussion about europe ’s future and policies , especially in areas like migration , defense and security , energy and climate , and relations with major powers like the united states and russia .
after all , despite their differences , virtually every country in europe is currently grappling with the question of how much europe it wants , how open and optimistic it should be about new forms of technology-enabled globalization , and how much social solidarity is appropriate .
these discussions – and thus the european parliament that emerges next year – are unlikely to adhere to standard party lines .
market failures are a fact of life , but so are government failures .
neo-liberal ideologies assume perfect markets , perfect information , and a host of other things , which even the best performing market economies can not satisfy .
• while neo-liberals worry about excessive government , weak government impedes growth because weak states can not provide law and order , can not enforce contracts , and can not ensure a safe , sound banking system .
it was , after all , too little regulation – the capital and financial market liberalization foisted on east asia by the imf and us treasury – that led to financial crisis in 1997 .
the question should not have been about how to deregulate quickly , but about how to develop the right regulatory framework .
they certainly do , but so what ?
any and all monetary-policy actions redistribute wealth .
an interest-rate hike pleases savers , whereas a rate cut is a boon to borrowers .
importers prefer a strong exchange rate ; exporters prefer a weak one .
to make any sense at all , monetary policy must have different effects on different groups at different times .
in any case , the chinese wage story is much more complicated than it might seem .
nominal wages may increase , while real wages stagnate , owing to higher inflation .
even if real wages increase in some coastal cities , “ surplus labor ” could keep the national average flat .
and even a real wage increase on the national level will not undermine competitiveness if labor productivity grows still faster .
so the conclusion seems to be that wage growth will not threaten china ’s competitiveness in the next 10 or even 20 years .
to judge whether their prices are “ too high ” at the existing exchange rate we have to look at the trade balance .
germany , europe ’s largest exporter , has a very large trade surplus with the rest of the world .
because german exports are attractive to foreign buyers at the existing exchange rate , germany in 2009 was the world ’s second largest exporter ( after china ) .
germany ’s exports exceeded its imports by nearly $ 200 billion in the past twelve months , a surplus equivalent to nearly 6 % of gdp .
it is clear that germany ’s net exports would remain high even if the euro appreciated substantially from its current level .
these structural elements have been reinforced by developments in the region , which have reinforced the sense among israeli voters that they are threatened by numerous enemies : iran and its nuclear ambitions ; hezbollah and hamas and their missiles ; the rise of isis amid state failure in iraq , syria , and elsewhere .
against this backdrop , it is easier to defend the status quo than to advocate accommodation involving territorial concessions .
netanyahu ’s victory was clearly an impressive personal comeback .
in the weeks leading up to the elections , it seemed that the public had grown weary of a prime minister who had been in office long enough to be corrupted by the arrogance of power and tainted by a raft of petty scandals .
he conducted a campaign that relied on his eloquence and charisma , as well as on scare tactics .
investment should therefore be gradual , which may mean temporarily storing some oil wealth abroad .
throughout this process , kenya ’s leaders should bear in mind that even the best plans can sometimes go awry , as ghana ’s recent experience has shown .
four billion barrels of oil were discovered off ghana ’s coast in 2007 , and production began in 2010 .
the next year , the petroleum revenue management act divided the wealth among consumption , investment , and offshore savings , as recommended by economists around the world ( including us ) .
but , with last year ’s presidential election , the situation began to deteriorate .
in 1997 , the imf and the united states treasury blamed the crisis on a lack of transparency in financial markets .
but when developing countries pointed their fingers at secret bank accounts and hedge funds , imf and us enthusiasm for greater transparency diminished .
since then , hedge funds have grown in importance , and secret bank accounts have flourished .
but there are some big differences between then and now .
most developing countries have accumulated massive foreign currency reserves .
in any event , hardships suffered by eu citizens could be lessened if the eurozone followed draghi ’s final prescription – providing more fiscal and monetary stimulus in some areas to offset reform and fiscal consolidation in others .
by selectively addressing the most dangerous risks , draghi was able to minimize them .
policymakers should do the same when it comes to sanctions against russia , mitigating their impact on those europeans who stand to suffer the most .
european policymakers have the tools and the intelligence to retain influence in ukraine .
if they look to the ecb , they will find the right model for deploying them .
while reports are surfacing that palin told a group of african-americans that she did not have to hire black people , working-class white women often understand their own experience in terms of racial hostility .
they perceive an underclass that they believe receives benefits denied to them and a thriving economy in the developing world that siphons off well-paying blue-collar jobs .
so , when sarah palin is escorted into the media limelight , she becomes the symbolic revenge fantasy of many of those silenced , exhausted factory workers and secretaries .
to see a working-class white woman be picked to serve a heartbeat away from the us president resonates powerfully with them .
think of the appeal of films like thelma and louise or working girl , in which the leading character is a gutsy , exploited secretary who , trampled by a snooty female ivy league boss , nonetheless manages to end up with the dream job , the dream guy , and the corner office .
china has already delivered on that front by abandoning a growth model that had successfully guided the country ’s economic development for more than 30 years .
it recognized the need to switch from a model that focused mainly on export - and investment-led production ( via manufacturing ) to one led by private consumption ( via services ) .
that change will give china a much better chance of avoiding the dreaded “ middle-income trap , ” which ensnares most developing economies , precisely because their policymakers mistakenly believe that the recipe for early-stage takeoff growth is sufficient to achieve developed-country status .
the us and chinese cases do not exist in a vacuum .
as i stress in my new book , the codependency of china and america ties them together inextricably .
hong kong – next month , policymakers , business leaders , academics , and civil-society representatives will meet in kiel , germany , for the global economic symposium ( ges ) , where they will attempt to develop concrete solutions to today ’s most pressing economic issues .
whether they produce effective proposals will depend on a comprehensive understanding of the factors underpinning – and undermining – financial stability worldwide .
at last year ’s summit , dialogues on central banking ’s future , which pitted inflation targeting against financial stability , produced three solutions : central banks should adopt a counter-cyclical policy approach ; a world monetary authority should be created to promote multilateral cooperation among central banks ; and price stability must remain central banks ’ primary goal .
although these solutions have some merit , they are inadequate to address effectively the complex and far-reaching failings that led to the 2007-2009 global financial crisis .
the crisis represented a comprehensive systemic failure , involving breakdowns at almost all levels , from macroeconomic theory to micro-level incentives to institutions .
the piketty framework highlights several drivers of this trend .
for starters , by lowering trade and investment barriers , globalization has created a sort of winner-take-all environment , in which the most technologically advanced actors have gained market share through economies of scale .
in particular , as the global economy moves toward knowledge-based value creation , a few innovators in global branding , high-technology , and creative industries win big , with the global boom in tech stocks augmenting their gains .
the resulting concentration of revenue , wealth , and power undermines systemic stability by creating too-big-to-fail entities , while hampering smaller players ’ ability to compete .
the global financial system reinforces this concentration , with negative real interest rates promoting financial repression on household savings .
prevention , however , must also address the dangers posed by the potentially destabilizing movements of capital .
recent experience teaches that the speed and magnitude with which both domestic and foreign investors can move into and out of capital markets far exceeds the ability of individual countries — and the international community — to counter such flows .
many countries do not have foreign currency reserves sufficient to meet sudden and large outflows of capital without destabilizing their domestic economy .
sometimes these outflows can occur through no fault of the country concerned , but as a result of financial market contagion that spreads from disturbances elsewhere .
this phenomenon was all too evident during the asian crisis and following the russian debt default of august 1998 .
like the courtiers who surrounded louis xviii , they have forgotten nothing and learned nothing .
the only question now in doubt is whether brown 's verdict on the euro will be " not quite yet , " " not before the next election , " or just plain " no . "
it is a decision being taken virtually independently of prime minister tony blair , and even against his wishes .
blair believes that britain ought to join the euro , because he wants britain to be , as he puts it , " at the heart of europe " .
most commentators tended to assume that , if that 's what tony blair wants , then sooner or later that is what will happen , because , after all , he is the prime minister .
trump ’s rejection of “ reasoned discourse , including commitments to truth and evidence , ” has been accompanied by an unlimited “ capacity to manipulate mass opinion and play on such repressed emotions as racism and class envy . ”
the result of trump ’s approach is that america ’s existing problems are worsening and huge opportunities are being missed .
but what can stop demons already unleashed ?
and , even if they are stopped , can the damage they have already wrought be reversed ?
there was some backlash against trump when he failed to condemn clearly the white supremacist demonstrators in charlottesville , virginia , whose “ unite the right ” rally in august ended with the murder of a counter-protester .
finally , trump has proposed tax deductions for average childcare costs .
that might seem widely beneficial , but it would help only those in high enough tax brackets to itemize deductions – mostly households with annual income above $ 75,000 ( median us household income was $ 54,462 in 2015 ) .
the question of whether trump ’s tax policies would benefit him directly remains unanswered , because , unlike all other presidential candidates since richard nixon , he has refused to release his income-tax records .
what is certain is that trump ’s tax policies are fiscally irresponsible .
indeed , there is no indication how any of his tax policies would be financed , and every indication that they would sharply expand the budget deficit .
and in south africa , marlon parker , founder of the social innovation academy and incubator rlabs , created a virtual currency called zlato to encourage active participation in skills-training workshops .
when young people attend courses , access laptops , or book rooms at rlabs cafes , they earn zlato credit that can be exchanged for food , medical care , and basic necessities .
since its inception in 2008 , rlabs has created tens of thousands of jobs and is now active in 24 countries .
africa ’s youngest entrepreneurs are not only finding ways to support themselves and contribute to their communities ; they are solving the main cause of migration on – and off – the continent .
entrepreneurs supported through the anzisha prize , for example , have created more than 300 jobs and generated more than $ 850,000 in capital .
but then scotland would demand its own special arrangement vis-à-vis the eu , putting the uk on track for a major constitutional shakeup , and possibly dissolution .
avoiding this scenario means sacrificing autonomy over trade policy for the sake of the good friday agreement and territorial integrity .
but this would upset hardline brexiteers and could split the conservative party , a risk theresa may has been unwilling to take .
british leaders need to acknowledge that all brexit scenarios involve tradeoffs , and the country urgently needs to hold a national debate to rank the electorate ’s preferences .
the choice is between one of the three brexit scenarios and suspending the brexit process altogether .
the country also received $ 70 billion in remittances last year – more than double the level of inward foreign direct investment .
there is undoubtedly a utilitarian aspect to the pravasi bharatiya divas celebrations , as suggested by the many parallel seminars being run by state governments to attract expatriate investment .
the importance of diaspora financing – from the remittances of working-class indians that have transformed kerala ’s countryside to the millions poured into high-tech businesses in bangalore or gurgaon by silicon valley investors – simply can not be minimized , especially during a global financial crisis .
but we should not get carried away : overseas indians still invest a lower proportion of their resources in india than overseas chinese do in china .
encouraging them to do more , and giving them reasons to do more , is certainly a worthwhile task for the indian government – and an overt goal of the annual conclave .
businesses that ignore the broader social and environmental context in which they operate are likely to pay a price : reputational damage and loss of brand value , falling sales , difficulties in recruiting talent , lower worker productivity , corruption , tougher government regulation , or an increase in climate-change-related costs .
there are now mobile phone apps that assess and grade large multinational companies ’ supply chains for customers , investors , and public officials .
companies that score poorly risk losing sales and investors and triggering official regulatory or legal action .
for example , apple ’s brand was recently shaken by revelations about brutal workplace conditions at foxconn factories in china , where most of its iphones and ipads are assembled .
in response to concerns among customers , employees , and shareholders , apple has improved working conditions and agreed to regular reviews by an independent observer .
they also tolerate enterprise or government policies that encourage high saving .
for example , the uptrend in saving in china began at around the same time as its one-child policy was implemented in 1979 .
this prevented the birth rate from rebounding after the cultural revolution of 1966-76 .
the late nobel laureate economist franco modigliani , in his last major published paper in 2004 ( co-authored with shi larry cao ) , argued that this demographic change explains much of the increase in the saving rate , as chinese substituted investment in capital for investment in children .
but income growth and demographics do not explain everything .
while the concept is modern , the idea is not new .
practical people have long understood its importance in leadership .
in the 1930s , former supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes , a crusty old veteran of the american civil war , was taken to meet franklin d. roosevelt , a fellow harvard graduate but one who had not been a distinguished student .
asked later about his impressions of the new president , holmes famously quipped : “ second-class intellect ; first-class temperament . ”
most historians would agree that roosevelt ’s success as a leader rested more on his emotional than his analytical iq .
a separate but simultaneous vote in the oil-rich province of abyei will allow voters to choose if they want to join the north or south .
the artificial fusion of the mainly arab , muslim north of sudan and the african south , where christianity and traditional animist beliefs are predominant , has been an abject failure .
since sudan won independence from the united kingdom in 1956 , the country has been convulsed by almost constant civil war based on the north-south cultural and religious divide .
matters were subsequently complicated by a separate conflict – this time between muslims – over resources in the western darfur region .
if the non-muslim south had gained at independence a large degree of religious , cultural , and administrative autonomy within a devolved federal structure , it is conceivable that the country could have remained at peace .
when i was administrator of the undp , i had to deal with constant “ requests ” from government representatives .
usually , they were formulated in an acceptable way , asking me to “ look into ” a particular issue .
but i also received requests – often from the global superpowers – in a way that was in clear violation of article 100 of the un charter , and i had to spend a great deal of time trying to avoid engaging with governments on such terms .
nonetheless , my overall experience at the undp and the world bank suggested that staff and management could and did behave in accordance with article 100 .
being responsive to member states ’ concerns and priorities was right and normal ; taking orders from them was not .
more broadly , the investor agenda for a low-carbon world has attracted 477 signatories , representing around $ 34 trillion in assets under management .
these investors are calling on governments not just to limit rising temperatures , but also to meet the paris climate agreement ’s more difficult goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 ° c above pre-industrial levels .
meanwhile , the institute for energy economics and financial analysis has found that those who ignored climate-change warnings have already taken a financial hit .
blackrock , the world ’s largest fund manager , lost around $ 90 billion over the last decade , three-quarters of which was due to its holdings in exxonmobil , chevron , shell , and bp .
and investors in general electric , including blackrock , lost a whopping $ 193 billion in the three years leading up to 2018 , because the company misjudged the pace of the shift to green energy and the collapse in demand for gas turbines and thermal power stations .
conflict with the united states is unlikely for the moment .
at such a delicate time internally , china would gain nothing from antagonizing the us .
but trouble with us allies , particularly japan , could draw the us into a fight that it would strongly prefer to avoid .
in short , china is on the brink of large , necessary , and dangerous transformations that promise to change the country for the better – or make everything , including regional stability , much worse .
the entire world has a large stake in what happens next .
south africa ’s post-apartheid constitution guarantees the right to public-sector information and , in many cases , private business information as well .
south africa adopted a freedom of information law in 2000 , five years before the united kingdom did .
now , however , the right to information in south africa is in jeopardy .
in late november , the parliament ’s lower house , led by the majority african national congress ( anc ) , overwhelmingly approved a new law – the “ protection of state information bill ” – whose adoption would shield the country ’s most-powerful political and business elites from public scrutiny .
south africa ’s nobel prize-winning novelist and anti-apartheid activist nadine gordimer has likened the bill to apartheid legislation .
washington , dc – the chinese economy has slowed in recent years , but it is still a strong performer , contributing about one-third of total economic growth worldwide .
it is also becoming more sustainable , in line with the shift in its growth model away from investment and exports and toward domestic demand and services .
in the run-up to next month ’s g20 summit in hangzhou , china has been calling loudly for new commitments to structural reforms to stimulate growth in advanced and emerging-market economies .
but china faces serious risks at home .
above all , domestic credit continues to expand at an unsustainable pace , with corporate debt accumulating to dangerous levels .
hong kong – at the beginning of this century , when china launched its “ going out ” policy – focused on using foreign-exchange reserves to support overseas expansion and acquisitions by chinese companies – few expected the country quickly to emerge as a leading economic player in latin america .
yet that is exactly what has happened .
the question is whether this is good for latin america .
in less than 15 years , china has gone from playing a rather marginal economic role in latin america to being among the top investors and trading partners for most countries in the region , as well as its foremost lender and infrastructure builder .
with its economic plans in latin america cruising along smoothly – a trend that seems unlikely to change anytime soon – china has now set its sights on another goal : expanding its political influence in the region and beyond .
there is little question , however , about which us candidate putin would like to see in the white house .
in remarks following the press conference , he praised trump as “ a very colorful , talented person ” and the “ absolute leader of the presidential race . ”
the two men certainly deserve each other .
both are consummate propagandists and performers .
and both are prepared – even eager – to bully , harangue , and lie to get ahead .
the first was to adopt the center right ’s agenda and pursue labor-market , tax , and investment policies that would “ adapt ” france to “ capitalist ” globalization .
somewhat surprisingly , this is the route he initially chose , quickly becoming the darling of the business-oriented international press .
the other avenue would have required macron to build on a pre-existing but vague conception of left-wing internationalism .
in practice , that would mean pursuing policies to help the middle class , while updating an obsolete center-left program to account for the effects of disruptive technologies and business models .
as the economist dani rodrik has long argued , more globalization requires a larger state , in order to compensate those displaced by free trade , capital-account liberalization , and so forth .
in the benign scenario , people will club together in different states on the basis of their preferences for big or small government , public or private provision of services , and international cooperation or isolationism .
mick mulvaney , trump ’s budget director , has himself made the case .
“ if you live in a state that wants to mandate maternity coverage for everybody , including 60-year-old women , that ’s fine , ” and if you do n’t , “ then you can figure out a way to change the state that you live in ” or alter “ state legislatures and state laws , ” in mulvaney ’s words .
“ why do we look to the federal government to try and fix our local problems ? ”
in the vindictive scenario , by contrast , trump and the congress could seek to limit progressive states ’ rights .
for years , overreliance on traditional fuels discouraged investment in clean technologies for power generation , despite the fact that both countries are innovators in green industries , like energy storage and smart grids .
whereas 22 % of south korea ’s energy needs , and 14 % of taiwan ’s , are met by nuclear , those ratios are now set to drop dramatically .
blueprints are still being formulated , but taken together the two countries ’ commitments mark a major shift in regional energy planning toward greener , cleaner technologies .
moreover , they will pave the way for increased investment in renewable-power installations , placing their countries on a new competitive footing in the regional market .
south korea ’s strategy calls for a phased withdrawal from the nuclear industry , through non-renewal of existing licenses and bans on future plants .
under heavy pressure from america , china 's leaders have agreed in principle to float the renminbi , but refuse to say when .
a floating currency is inevitable as china liberalizes its capital market and eliminates restrictions on international capital movements ; otherwise , china would have to surrender control over its money supply and interest rates to the us .
yet china 's rulers are right to postpone the decision to float .
the chinese can delay , but they ca n't hide from a fundamental economic law : if the exchange rate between the currencies of two countries is fixed and capital flows between them are unrestricted , the economically dominant one will exercise control over the monetary policy of the other .
because the dollar is the dominant world reserve currency , and america 's fed controls the supply of us dollars , as long as china sticks to a fixed exchange rate , it can not control its own money supply .
so we are in a race .
can we turn the tap to zero net emissions before the tub hits a level that takes us above the 2ºc threshold set in paris ?
in fact , even that level may not be low enough .
as the paris agreement recognizes , many scientists believe that warming above 1.5 ºc is risky and that adaptation to it will be extremely expensive , particularly for developing countries and island states .
the good news is that if we somehow stopped all emissions today , temperatures would continue to rise only for a decade or so , before stabilizing .
indeed , no one has any idea of the consequences , both for the uk in the global trading system , or the effect on domestic political stability .
i am afraid it is not going to be a pretty picture .
mind you , citizens of the west are blessed to live in a time of peace : changing circumstances and priorities can be addressed through democratic processes instead of foreign and civil wars .
but what , exactly , is a fair , democratic process for making irreversible , nation-defining decisions ?
is it really enough to get 52 % to vote for breakup on a rainy day ?
defense spending is 1.6 % of gdp in germany , 2 % in italy , and 1.5 % in spain ; only france and the uk reach 3 % .
but confining discussion about defense commitment to the percent of gdp spent on the military is insufficient because there are economies of scale in defense spending .
so one would expect that smaller countries will spend proportionally more on defense than larger ones .
instead , today america alone spends more than most of its nato allies combined , and defense spending in the us is likely to increase even more in the years to come .
security and global influence are not the only benefits that come through military expenditure .
new york – at the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly this month , there was a widespread sense of foreboding among world leaders .
the anxiety went beyond standard concerns about what us president donald trump would say , do , or tweet .
even before the summit began , europeans , canadians , mexicans , south koreans , and japanese had been consulting in earnest about the need for a new alliance to save the multilateral system .
in the late 1960s , former us secretary of state dean acheson looked back at the immediate post-war era and felt as though he had been “ present at the creation ” of a new world based on shared rules and multilateral institutions .
but at the unga this year , many attendees felt as though they were present at the destruction of that world .
in the medium term , the world abounds with tensions and potential crises that us leadership is likely to be indispensable to resolving .
as events over the past two weeks in egypt have demonstrated all too vividly , the arab awakening is still only in its first act in many countries .
indeed , democracy is fragile , at best , across north africa ; and , in the middle east , jordan , the palestinian territories , kuwait , and saudi arabia have only begun to feel the ripples of the tidal wave sweeping the region .
bahrain remains a flashpoint ; iraq is deeply unstable ; and the simmering conflict between iran and israel could flare up at any time .
even when the us is not on the front lines , it has played a vital role in behind-the-scenes diplomacy , nudging wary rivals closer to one another to create a united opposition , and working with regional leaders like turkey , egypt , and saudi arabia to broker deals .
in today ’s germany , because no one with decisive power in business , finance , or government experienced the war , the european project is no longer viewed as conditioning europe ’s collective future .
these new leaders envision europe only as a trade regime .
meanwhile , german diplomacy is actively reconstructing the country ’s economic and cultural spheres of influence , and not only in eastern europe .
the impact of this lost european perspective became clear in the autumn of 2008 when , in the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis and the failure of lehman brothers , chancellor angela merkel ’s first impulse was nationalistic and wholly anti-european .
there would be no common european plan to address the crisis , and no call for public funds .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
such shortcomings are especially apparent in poland , where a highly centralized political system creates a pernicious winner-take-all dynamic .
when is a free-trade agreement bad ?
when the treaty 's underlying purpose is neither about trade nor freedom .
such a pact - calling for a " united economic space " - is now being entered into by russia , ukraine , kazakhstan , and belarus .
on the surface , a " united economic space " sounds like something to applaud .
but , sadly , the treaty will only entrench postcommunism 's corrupt and criminal business practices , not increase trade or prosperity .
the ascent of nahda ( renaissance ) , the leading islamist party , is less a reflection of latent ideological support among a newly liberated people than it is a testament to the party ’s remarkable ability to fill the post-revolutionary political vacuum .
since january , nahda has opened more than 200 offices .
scores of volunteers are deployed in electoral campaigning at a grassroots , door-to-door level .
the party ’s imposing headquarters in the suburbs of tunis symbolize its position as the most effective political operation in the country by far .
while opponents ominously recall the involvement of party cadres in the deadly bombings of tourist targets in 1991 , nahda has gone to some lengths to appease its critics .
consider first the claim that the dollar ’s status as a reserve currency protects it , because governments around the world need to hold dollars as foreign exchange reserves .
the problem is that foreign holdings of dollar securities are no longer primarily “ foreign exchange reserves ” in the traditional sense .
in earlier decades , countries held dollars because they needed to have a highly liquid and widely accepted currency to bridge the financing gap if their imports exceeded their exports .
the obvious candidate for this reserve fund was us treasury bills .
but , since the late 1990 ’s , countries like south korea , taiwan , and singapore have accumulated very large volumes of foreign reserves , reflecting both export-driven growth strategies and a desire to avoid a repeat of the speculative currency attacks that triggered the 1997-1998 asian financial crisis .
by bad economics , i mean allowing financial markets to dictate what happens to the real economy .
good economics , by contrast , recognizes a government ’s duty to protect its constituents against distress , insecurity , and calamity .
it is very hard for liberals to accept that bad politics can produce good economics , and that good politics can produce bad economics .
and yet hungary offers a clear example of the former .
under prime minister viktor orbán , the country has become increasingly authoritarian .
countries and organizations are already mobilizing .
the united nations ’ food and agriculture organization argues that rising food prices could lead to increasing global conflicts .
the davos world economic forum ranks food insecurity as a major risk to humanity .
the world bank has forcefully emphasized the importance of agriculture to jump-starting economic expansion and breaking the cycle of poverty .
un secretary ban ki-moon has created a working group to define a common plan of action , and france ’s president nicolas sarkozy has proposed a global partnership for food .
and yet negative bonds yields are also occurring in countries and regions where the currency is depreciating and likely to depreciate further , including germany , other parts of the eurozone core , and japan .
so , why are investors holding such assets ?
many long-term investors , like insurance companies and pension funds , have no alternative , as they are required to hold safer bonds .
of course , negative returns make their balance sheets shakier : a defined-benefit pension plan needs positive returns to break even , and when most of its assets yield a negative nominal return , such results become increasingly difficult to achieve .
but , given such investors ' long-term liabilities ( claims and benefits ) , their mandate is to invest mostly in bonds , which are less risky than stocks or other volatile assets .
in his first year and a half in office , macron started to tackle these problems , and managed to deliver a budget in line with eu deficit rules .
the problem is that in pursuing these reforms , macron abandoned his core center-left constituency .
step by step , his reforms seemed consistently to benefit the rich .
and so , when it was announced that his government would increase the tax on diesel fuel , middle - and working-class commuters took to the streets .
with polls showing that around 70 % of the french support the yellow vest protesters , macron was forced to retreat .
as it stands , perhaps the biggest barriers to international cooperation are political .
in recent years , there has been an intensifying backlash against international cooperation , rooted partly in fears – stoked by populist political leaders in many countries – that transnational “ elites ” are trying to impose “ globalism ” : an “ ideology that prioritizes the neoliberal global order over national interests . ”
but perspectives that refute this narrative seem to be gaining ground .
many world leaders believe that the western countries squandered their influence over the international system by intervening politically and militarily in the affairs of others without any clear endgame .
some also argue that the global elite has only pretended to pursue socioeconomic change , while actually maintaining a status quo that has benefited them .
by increasing inflation , the fed would turn real interest rates seriously negative , thereby coercing thrifty households into spending instead of saving .
with rising demand , firms would hire , and all would be well .
this is a different logic from the one that calls for inflation as a way of reducing long-term debt ( at the expense of investors ) , but it has equally serious weaknesses .
first , while low rates might encourage spending if credit were easy , it is not at all clear that traditional savers today would go out and spend .
think of the soon-to-retire office worker .
though the g-8 had made a clear promise , there was no plan on how to fulfill it ; indeed , there were clear instructions that there would be no such plan .
the g-8 is now reaping the consequences of its inaction .
for the first year after the gleneagles meeting , aid numbers were padded by misleading accounting on debt cancellation operations .
with those debt cancellation operations largely completed , the data are now revealing the stark truth : development aid to africa and to poor countries more generally is stagnant , contrary to all the promises that were made .
specifically , between 2005 and 2006 , overall aid to africa , excluding debt cancellation operations , increased by a meager 2 % .
perhaps the biggest grievance of the past year has been inequality .
but , at the global level , inequality is falling .
and while inequality has risen within some advanced economies , the increase has not been particularly dramatic , and it remains at reasonable levels .
but that is not what the average citizen sees .
according to the european bank for reconstruction and development ’s new transition report , based on the 2015-2016 life in transition survey produced by the world bank and the ebrd ( where i am chief economist ) , the perceived increase in inequality far exceeds the reality described by official data , typically based on household surveys .
washington , dc – the united states federal reserve system is one of the most powerful governmental organizations in the history of the world .
america ’s central bank has control over the supply of dollars , and currently exerts great influence over interest rates , both for short-term and long-term borrowing .
and , though the fed was partly responsible for the regulatory failures that led to the global economy ’s near-meltdown in 2008-2009 , post-crisis reform has left it with even greater authority and more responsibility for overseeing the financial system .
that is a worrying outcome , because senior fed officials seem to have slipped back into their pre-2008 ways , ignoring concerns about dangerous financial-sector behavior – even when those concerns are expressed by members of the us senate banking committee .
this is not only unfortunate ; it is also dangerous , because the fed ’s political position is much more precarious than its leadership seems to realize .
more by luck than by wisdom , this catastrophic situation did not develop .
unless there is a global catastrophe – a meteorite impact , a world war , or a pandemic – mankind will remain a major environmental force for many millennia .
as a result , scientists and engineers face a daunting task during the anthropocene era : to guide us towards environmentally sustainable management .
this will require appropriate human behavior at all levels , and may well involve internationally accepted , large-scale geo-engineering projects to “ optimize ” climate .
at this stage , however , we are still largely treading on terra incognita .
in all these cases , the cynic would be half-right .
constitutional change is for political leaders a welcome distraction from the much more change-resistant issues of social policy .
but there are at least two exceptions to this suspicion .
one is the establishment of democracy and the rule of law in countries that have recently emerged from dictatorship .
the process requires constitution making of an often complex and painful kind .
this is undermining corporate profitability , spurring companies to deleverage and reduce investment , and fueling further declines in ppi .
the enduring importance of real-estate investment to china ’s economic growth is reflected in trends from the first quarter of this year .
annual gdp growth of 6.7 % , despite being the slowest rate for any quarter in seven years , exceeded market expectations .
and it was driven partly by an unforeseen increase in real-estate investment growth , to 6 % .
this is not to say that what china needs is more real-estate investment .
but that does n’t mean that trump skeptics can just sit back and wait for him to be proven wrong , because it is possible that , in the first year , the reported trade deficit will narrow , even as the true trade deficit widens .
it all comes down to “ transfer pricing ” – the prices multinational corporations use to put a value on cross-border trade in inputs among their subsidiaries .
consider an american pharmaceutical company that establishes a plant in ireland .
the irish affiliate imports some inputs ( most notably , the intellectual property represented by the drug patent ) , assembles the product in ireland , and exports it back to the us .
in terms of value-added , the patent makes the biggest contribution .
the recommendations included increasing affordable transportation to family-planning facilities , expanding access to modern contraception ( including emergency contraception ) , increasing the availability of sex education , and developing strategies to reduce the stigma of abortions .
and yet , as a result of us policy , none of these changes will come easily .
if countries like south africa are ever to escape republican administrations ’ assault on reproductive freedom , new strategies are needed to fight the global gag rule .
solutions start at home , which is why developing countries need to begin moving away from conditional aid that restricts health providers ’ ability to work in accordance with local laws .
local ngos , together with responsible global partners , must find new support for programs that educate women about their rights and provide access to safe abortion services .
we want technology firms to play a central role in providing new ideas and disruptive thinking .
we want firms that already offer refugees an online education , internet access and it hardware to drive the provision of education to displaced and isolated girls and boys .
in establishing this fund , we are ending the era of the formulaic crisis response .
it was gandhi ’s belief that reflection could motivate action by recalibrating our moral compass .
what makes this fund unique is not the series of new benchmarks it sets .
civil society had been energized by the maidan revolution that ousted former president viktor yanukovych , but it was in turmoil .
debate over the association agreement with the european union , along with the russian-backed rebellion in the east , had stoked tensions over distinctions that previously played little or no role in people ’s lives .
but since parliamentary elections in october , ukraine has begun to pull itself together .
russia ’s intervention has to some extent backfired , strengthening support for a european orientation .
eastern ukraine may have voted differently from the rest of the country , but the overwhelming majority of voters came out in favor of europe .
regulators there are now keenly focused on the implications of brexit , which will require complex arrangements to manage a new relationship between london and the eurozone .
the top priority for the european central bank must be to preserve the integrity of the eu banking union , which is under pressure from both brexit and the crisis gripping italy ’s banks .
against this background , it will be a challenge to retain the primacy of global standards and to secure continued buy-in to the basel process .
the bank for international settlements ’ new general manager , agustín carstens , a former governor of mexico ’s central bank , will have a key role to play , as will whoever replaces mark carney ( the current governor of the bank of england ) next year as chairman of the fsb .
it is likely , too , that there will soon be a new chair of the basel committee itself .
supervision , more transparency in financial markets , an effective early-warning system for financial crises , and better international policy coordination .
the crisis has made it clear that national supervision of banks that operate globally is insufficient .
regulatory gaps have caused spillover effects to other countries .
crisis resolution mechanisms for banks that operate globally were absent .
international coordination of regulation is clearly required .
europe can face down the threats of us extraterritorial sanctions in partnership with china , india , and russia .
trade with iran can easily be denominated in euros , renminbi , rupees , and rubles , avoiding us banks .
oil-for-goods trade can be accomplished through a euro-clearing mechanism such as instex .
in fact , the us extraterritorial sanctions are not a credible long-term threat .
if the us were to implement them against most of the rest of the world , the damage to the us economy , the dollar , the stock market , and us leadership would be irreparable .
countries would be well advised not to include pari passu clauses in future debt contracts , at least without specifying more fully what is intended .
such contracts should also include collective-action clauses , which make it impossible for vulture funds to hold up debt restructuring .
when a sufficient proportion of creditors agree to a restructuring plan ( in the case of argentina , the holders of more than 90 % of the country ’s debt did ) , the others can be forced to go along .
the fact that the international monetary fund , the us department of justice , and anti-poverty ngos all joined in opposing the vulture funds is revealing .
but so , too , is the court ’s decision , which evidently assigned little weight to their arguments .
knowing what to do in this increasingly complex and volatile situation is the easy part : look at the multilateral consultation policy plans and “ just do it . ”
as the us treasury ’s recent semiannual report to america ’s congress noted , for china these plans are to “ rebalance its economy : boosting domestic demand and consumption-led growth ; reforming its financial system ; and achieving greater flexibility in its exchange-rate regime .
indeed , rebalancing the pattern of growth is a central economic goal of china ’s leadership . ”
but expanding demand and allowing real effective exchange rate appreciation in china will not be enough if other countries do not do their part .
oil exporters must increase fiscal spending further ; japan and the euro area must trigger higher growth through structural reforms ; and the us must implement concrete measures to sustain higher savings .
washington , dc – gross domestic product has been the ultimate measure of an economy ’s welfare for over 80 years .
but , as the world ’s economies become increasingly complex and technology-focused , economists are increasingly questioning gdp ’s usefulness as a gauge of an economy ’s health , with some arguing for a radically new approach .
africa ’s experience shows why such an approach is badly needed .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the notion that he should n’t take steps to protect his interests is ideological partiality disguised as objectivity , and it lends credence to putin ’s claims that the west is out to get him .
do n’t get me wrong : despite its imperfections , the us remains a positive force in the world .
indeed , it may well be the only strongly positive force , along with the european union , which should stop squabbling and start curtailing megalomaniacal and illiberal leaders like hungary ’s putin-infatuated prime minister , viktor orbán .
moreover , the prospect that their new president is in putin ’s pocket should certainly be worrying to americans .
and the west ’s policies toward russia – economic sanctions or military exercises in border countries like poland – are not necessarily wrong .
fortunately , there are encouraging signs that the commitment will be honored .
but larger financial flows are needed , particularly from the private sector .
according to the oecd and the climate policy initiative , developed countries collectively mobilized $ 52.2 billion in 2013 and $ 61.8 billion in 2014 to help poor countries reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and build resilience against the effects of climate change that can no longer be avoided .
while it is important to note that this figure is only an estimate , it represents a preliminary but credible indicator of climate finance , based on information provided by developed countries .
if one assumes greater leverage for private-sector investment , the number would be higher .
first among such sources of uncertainty is the global economy : will volatility and imbalances lead to collapse , or will greater multipolarity underpin greater resilience ?
similarly , will governments and institutions be able to adapt fast enough to harness change , or will they be overwhelmed by it ?
moreover , while interstate conflict has been declining , intrastate conflict driven by youthful populations , identity politics , and scarce resources will continue to plague some regions like the middle east , south asia , and africa .
and that leads to yet another potentially game-changing issue : whether regional instability remains contained or fuels global insecurity .
then there is a set of questions concerning the impact of new technologies .
the irony , however , is that the us exercised greater control over the iraqi oil sector under the un 's pre-war " oil-for-food program " ( in which the un , not saddam hussein , determined the level of iraqi oil sales abroad ) than it will in any future democratic iraq .
if the bush administration was seeking stable , secure , diverse and cheap oil supplies , it could have simply lifted the embargos on libya , iran , iraq , and sudan and let the oil gush .
but america 's interest in iraqi oil was not driven either by economics or energy policy .
the bush administration recognized that , above all , iraqi oil is a critical geopolitical asset .
whoever controls iraqi oil controls iraq .
moreover , even if china becomes the world ’s largest economy in , say , 2018 , americans would still be far richer than chinese , with per capita gdp in america four times higher than in china .
to be sure , income inequality and social injustice are a concomitant of capitalist culture throughout the west .
but challengers like china and india are in no position to preach .
compared to indian capitalism , capitalism ’s ethical failures elsewhere look especially benign .
a hundred oligarchs in india hold assets equivalent to 25 % of gdp , while 800 million of their compatriots survive on less than a dollar a day .
usually , this principle means that marginal tax rates should be similar at different levels of labor income , for various types of consumption , for outlays today versus tomorrow , and so on .
from this perspective , a shortcoming of the us individual income-tax system is that marginal tax rates are high at the bottom ( because of means testing of welfare programs ) and the top ( because of the graduated-rate structure ) .
thus , the government has moved in the wrong direction since 2009 , sharply raising marginal tax rates at the bottom ( by dramatically increasing transfer programs ) and , more recently , at the top ( by raising tax rates on the rich ) .
one of the most efficient tax-raising methods is the us payroll tax , for which the marginal tax rate is close to the average rate ( because deductions are absent and there is little graduation in the rate structure ) .
therefore , cutting the payroll tax rate in 2011-2012 and making the rate schedule more graduated ( on the medicare side ) were mistakes from the standpoint of efficient taxation .
so long as developing countries remain integrated into the global economy – and do not take measures to restrain the impact of international prices on domestic prices – domestic prices of rice and other grains are bound to rise markedly when international prices do .
for many developing countries , high oil and food prices represent a triple threat : not only do importing countries have to pay more for grain , they have to pay more to bring it to their countries and still more to deliver it to consumers who may live a long distance from ports .
raising interest rates can reduce aggregate demand , which can slow the economy and tame increases in prices of some goods and services , especially non-traded goods and services .
but , unless taken to an intolerable level , these measures by themselves can not bring inflation down to the targeted levels .
for example , even if global energy and food prices increase at a more moderate rate than now – for example , 20 % per year – and get reflected in domestic prices , bringing the overall inflation rate to , say , 3 % would require markedly falling prices elsewhere . that would almost surely entail a marked economic slowdown and high unemployment .
thus they do not formally give up anything .
the leaders that brought on failure and the groups that did not triumph become heroes for being able to claim that they courageously fought the enemy without being crushed .
the important points for them are that they gained revenge by inflicting damage , showed that they were real men , did not buckle under , and survived .
such a pattern is a formula for endless conflict and endless defeat .
yet defeats do not force new attitudes , policies , or leaders .
fearful pronouncements about the rise of incipient ( or actual ) fascism are misplaced .
the basic institutions of american governance have survived greater challenges than any that trump may pose .
although america in 2017 is deeply divided , americans remain committed to the central tenets of democracy : free , fair , and regular elections and the protection of political , religious , and economic liberty .
it is unlikely that trump will attempt to overturn any of them ; and even if he does try , he will fail .
when he leaves office , the us will essentially be what it was when he entered it : the world ’s most powerful democracy .
certain professional organizations are emphasizing the need to obtain patient consent even if tissue has already been removed from a patient 's body .
today , there are brain tissue banks , breast tissue banks , blood banks , umbilical cord banks , dna banks and tissue repositories for studying various diseases .
virtually all of us have tissue on file somewhere .
who should have access to these samples ?
for what purposes can they be used ?
with soft power , however , the energy of empowered followers strengthens leaders .
leadership is broadly distributed throughout healthy democracies , and all citizens need to learn more about what makes good and bad leaders .
potential leaders , in turn , can learn more about the sources and limits of the soft-power skills of emotional iq , vision , and communication , as well as hard-power political and organizational skills .
they must also better understand the nature of the contextual intelligence they will need to educate their hunches and sustain strategies of smart power .
most important , in today ’s age of globalization , revolutionary information technology , and broadened participation , citizens in democracies must learn more about the nature and limits of the new demands on leadership .
the polisario front fought a war with morocco until 1991 , when the un brokered a ceasefire agreement .
that deal was supposed to set the stage for a referendum on independence in western sahara the following year – a democratic solution .
but morocco has prevented it from ever taking place .
morocco has also repeatedly obstructed progress toward further negotiations .
it has done so in defiance of the un security council , even going so far as to bar the un ’s special envoy from travelling to the region to set the stage for talks .
moreover , both candidates embody continuity – with chirac ’s gaullist side for sarkozy and with françois mitterrand for royal – as much as rupture .
royal openly claims mitterand ’s legacy as she searches for legitimacy , while sarkozy ’s rejection of chirac ’s legacy has more to do with form than substance .
to a large extent , sarkozy can be seen as chirac with more , whereas royal is clearly mitterrand with less .
when the voters decide in the spring of 2007 , their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations , as it did in 2002 , when chirac faced the odious nationalist jean-marie le pen in the second round .
as in 2002 , the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less .
with obama unwilling – or unable , due to rising political partisanship at home – to take the lead in addressing crises like those in egypt , libya , and syria , challengers to american primacy took heart in 2014 , and us allies took fright .
global power must be allocated somewhere ; if the us would not fill its leading role on the international stage , an understudy would have to step in .
but china ’s recent shift away from muscle-flexing , and its confluence of interests with a us-led order , offers hope that it will not fuel large-scale regional instability this year .
indeed , china withdrew its jumbo oil platform from the waters of the disputed paracel islands last july , and it has been sending surveillance ships to the senkaku islands less frequently .
chinese officials have also become more willing to discuss the creation of a code of conduct for the south china sea .
labor-force participation in the us has fallen to levels not seen since women began entering the labor market in large numbers .
most americans ’ income and wealth are below their levels long before the crisis .
indeed , a typical full-time male worker ’s income is lower than it has been in more than four decades .
yes , we have done some things to improve financial markets .
there have been some increases in capital requirements – but far short of what is needed .
the republican presidential campaign adds another element of uncertainty .
the two leading candidates for the party ’s nomination , donald trump and ted cruz , both say that they would tear up the iran nuclear deal , if elected .
it is worth recalling the outcome of president george w. bush ’s analogous decision to tear up bill clinton ’s “ framework agreement ” with north korea : the kim regime promptly and predictably developed a nuclear bomb .
whether the us will continue to lead the world remains unclear .
what is clear is that us politics , not global developments , will be the main determinant .
president vladimir voronin later granted the detainees amnesty .
nevertheless , many remain in detention and voronin continues to hurl accusations at the opposition and romania of organizing a coup d’état .
legal proceedings have been opened against opposition parties .
restoring stability and a fair democratic system to moldova is important , first and foremost , because moldovans deserve a government that is accountable .
stability is also important because the country borders on romania , a european union member state .
on the eve of their downfall , a few arab autocrats were actually being lauded by the world bank and international monetary fund for their supposed success in adopting the “ right ” economic policies .
the world bank ’s subsequent mea culpa is a clear indication that there may have been a problem with the policies they had prescribed for the arab ancien régimes .
this raises a raft of other questions .
were economists focused on the wrong indicators ?
were they misled by false inferences ?
while china did decide to allow the rmb to appreciate gradually after that , it has relied on capital controls to prevent hot money from flowing in .
the controls are leaky , to be sure , but they have worked ( so far ) , which is why china has effectively maintained macroeconomic stability over the years .
the key objective of china ’s capital controls is to prevent non-residents from holding domestic rmb-denominated assets that are unrelated to trade and long-term capital flows .
but rmb internationalization encourages non-residents to hold more rmbs and rmb-denominated assets .
as a result of rmb internationalization , rmb deposits held by hong kong residents have reached rmb370 billion ( $ 57 billion ) , and the amount may reach rmb1 trillion by the end of the year .
but it is more than that .
democracy is being directly threatened in the country where it should have the deepest cultural and political roots .
trump does not just want to avoid repeating the failed policies of the past , as he puts it .
he and his supporters also have taken aim at the fundamental institutions upon which american democracy is based , including the courts , the legislative branch , the independent media , and more .
the nineteenth-century prussian military officer and theorist carl von clausewitz spoke presciently about the age of total war that would arrive less than a century after his death .
in short , structural reforms alone can not be relied upon to stimulate growth in 2012 .
instead , the immediate focus needs to be on boosting investment and exports in economies with a current-account deficit – such as france , italy , and spain ( and the united kingdom ) – and stimulating consumption in surplus countries such as germany and the netherlands .
the european central bank has acted decisively to prop up european banks ; now it needs to support the real economy , too .
while official interest rates are only 1 % , solvent sovereigns such as spain pay more than 5 % to borrow for ten years , while creditworthy businesses in italy can borrow only at punitive rates , if at all .
so the ecb should do more to unblock the transmission mechanism for monetary policy ; the european banking authority should discourage excessive deleveraging by insisting that banks raise specific capital amounts rather than hit a uniform 9 % ratio ; and , where necessary , national governments should provide guarantees for bank lending to small and medium-size businesses .
during prime minister aznar ’s first term his popular party privatized most public sector firms and deregulated many service sectors .
his new government vows to continue eliminating the public deficit and lowering unemployment .
it also promises to cut income taxes , put the country ’s social security system on firmer footing and reduce costs of shedding labor .
introducing real competition in energy and telecoms , lacking in the privatization process until now , is also pledged .
aznar ’s program is sensible yet ambitious .
cambridge : the internet now pervades every area of business life ; the jump in business activity over the internet astounds .
an important new report by the u.s. commerce department , " the emerging digital economy " , suggests that the internet is reshaping not only american business , but the world economy .
in 1994 , three million people , mostly americans , used the internet .
in 1998 , 100 million people over the world are connected .
as recently as january 1995 , there were around 27,000 business addresses on the internet .
there is no reliable scientific evidence that gm foods cause illness , despite the fact that they receive much more intense scrutiny than more “ natural ” foods .
( natural foods can also pose health risks , as was shown recently by studies establishing that a popular type of cinnamon can cause liver damage . )
although cross-pollination between gm crops and wild plants can occur , so far no new superweeds have emerged .
we should be pleased about that – and perhaps the regulations that were introduced in response to the concerns expressed by environmental organizations played a role in that outcome .
regulations to protect the environment and the health of consumers should be maintained .
virus protection and virus development constitute an uneven arms race .
a virus can be just a couple hundred lines of computer code , compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-virus programs , which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies .
we are told not to worry about large-scale cyber meltdowns , because none has occurred , and governments are being vigilant .
unfortunately , another lesson of the financial crisis is that most politicians are congenitally incapable of making difficult choices until risks actually materialize .
let us hope that we are lucky for a while longer .
these migrant workers ’ taxes would help developed countries fund services for the elderly , and their remittances would help their home countries .
this approach has enormous potential benefits .
indeed , a modest 3 % increase in the developed-country workforce would provide a larger economic boost than removing all remaining trade barriers .
moreover , every dollar invested in this initiative would produce nearly $ 50 in returns , making it an exceptionally effective use of limited resources .
these impressive figures emerged from a comprehensive analysis conducted by a team of top economists tasked by my think tank , the copenhagen consensus center , with assessing possible population-related targets , in order to identify the best global investments .
wellington – paracetamol ( known as acetaminophen in the united states ) is one of the world ’s most commonly used drugs .
it is the preferred medication for relieving fever and pain because of its safety profile . however , 10 years ago , a hypothesis was proposed that the use of paracetamol may increase the risk of developing asthma . it was suggested that a change from the use of aspirin to paracetamol among children in the us during the 1980 ’s may have contributed to the increasing prevalence of childhood asthma noted during this period .
substitution of paracetamol for aspirin , researchers proposed , may have led to an enhanced allergic immune response , thereby increasing susceptibility to asthma and other allergic disorders .
since then , a number of epidemiological studies have reported an association between asthma and exposure to paracetamol in the womb , in childhood , and in adulthood .
these studies led to the suggestion that the use of paracetamol may represent an important risk factor in the development of asthma .
today , the country is believed to have about 60 working astronomers , more than half of all the astronomers working in africa .
“ south africa is the jewel of african astronomy , ” says charles mcgruder , a professor in the department of physics and astronomy at western kentucky university .
in a country that is deeply divided economically , “ what on earth is the benefit to the poor and the downtrodden of deep space research ? ” asks physicist harold annegarn , a professor at the university of johannesburg .
“ the answer , ” he says , “ is partly that by supporting a thriving top-level intellectual community , we can train our next generation of intellectuals . ”
mcgruder , who works closely with african astronomers , agrees that a space program for the region is critical to raising the profile of careers in science and engineering in a part of the world where the most educated people still go into finance or management .
because neither banks nor investors had enough money to plough into the networked mega-firms , the mega-bank emerged in the form of a global cartel of banks and shadowy funds , each with its own shareholders .
unprecedented new debt was thus created to transfer value to the present , in the hope of profiting sufficiently to repay the future .
mega-finance , mega-equity , mega-pension funds , and mega-financial crises were the logical outcome .
the crashes of 1929 and 2008 , the unstoppable rise of big tech , and all the other ingredients of today ’s discontent with capitalism , became inescapable .
in this system , calls for a gentler capitalism are mere fads – especially in the post-2008 reality , which confirmed the total control over society by mega-firms and mega-banks .
a couple of years ago , forecasters were confident that global imbalances would reemerge once the crisis passed .
that now seems unlikely : neither the us nor china is going back to its pre-crisis growth rate or spending pattern .
nor are earlier trade balances about to reemerge .
america ’s trade position will be strengthened by the shale-gas revolution , which promises energy self-sufficiency , and by increases in productivity that auger further re-shoring of manufacturing production .
emerging markets , for their part , have learned that export surpluses are no guarantee of rapid growth .
both governments have cracked down on nongovernmental organizations and targeted or co-opted the media .
still , in what remains of hungary ’s free press , one can sometimes find credible reports alleging that prime minister viktor orbán and his cronies are pillaging eu funds to benefit themselves , their families , and their business associates .
in fact , orbán ’s government has been the subject of a number of investigations by the european anti-fraud office .
despite such behavior , orbán was re-elected earlier this month , and his fidesz party , in alliance with the christian democrats , now holds a two-thirds parliamentary majority – enough to amend the constitution .
during the election campaign , orbán ’s government saturated the country in xenophobic , anti-semitic propaganda .
following these discussions , the us national institute of health ( nih ) promulgated guidelines that allow the use of government funds for stem-cell research but , in their present form , prohibit federally-funded investigators from creating new stem cell lines .
that restriction requires that stem cell lines must be obtained only from privately-funded or commercial sources that follow the protocols mandated by the guidelines .
i believe that restricting the use of government funds for the creation of stem cells , although politically prudent , imposes substantial scientific handicaps .
we know that a variety of poorly understood factors cause embryonic stem cells to lose their capacity to differentiate into all possible cell types .
this loss of capacity to differentiate may be caused by the particular mode in which the stem cells are derived , the conditions surrounding their growth , and other variables of handling .
yet , far from accepting these contributions , the plan would largely cut regulators out of the process .
for example , the plan would bar regulators from initiating a mega-bank ’s bankruptcy , leaving it to the discretion of the bank ’s own managers .
in the nonfinancial sector , failing companies often wait too long before declaring bankruptcy , so creditors may step in to do some pushing , potentially even forcing a bankruptcy of a failed firm .
while bank regulators have tools to push banks similarly , their most effective one is the power to initiate a bankruptcy when it is best for the economy .
taking this tool away could have severe adverse consequences .
copenhagen – political rhetoric has shifted away from the need to respond to the “ generational challenge ” of climate change .
investment in alternative energy technologies like solar and wind is no longer peddled on environmental grounds .
instead , we are being told of the purported economic payoffs , above all , the promise of so-called “ green jobs . ”
unfortunately , that does not measure up to economic reality .
the copenhagen consensus center asked gürcan gülen , a senior energy economist at the center for energy economics , bureau of economic geology at the university of texas at austin , to assess the “ state of the science ” in defining , measuring , and predicting the creation of green jobs .
it is , however , regrettable that the treaty ’s 28 articles are very vague .
it is absolutely essential that this text be accompanied by a new method , adapted to the current world in which we live – a world where politics is no longer conducted in the muffled debates of ministerial meetings or through convoluted communiqués .
genuine involvement by civil society is the only way to stimulate two struggling governments and overcome their conservatism .
after all , we have entered an era in which speed , even more than money , determines the course of events , and where the capacity for experimentation across all sectors is an essential factor for success .
in today ’s winner-takes-all economy , the bulk of newly created wealth accrues to those who innovate the fastest .
for example , somaliland and ethiopia are collaborating on the construction of a gas-export pipeline from ethiopia ’s ogaden region , promising new jobs and income for people in one of the poorest and least developed parts of the world .
although there is much that we can and will do to help ourselves , the horn of africa can still benefit from international assistance .
but the international community needs to do more than provide food and medicine to victims of famine and drought .
necessary as that is , we need pro-growth investments that will help provide jobs for our peoples and products and resources for the world .
that means focusing on promoting market economies and stable government , rather than subsidizing failure and failed states .
trento – the most significant result of the recent european parliament election is neither that conservatives and social democrats lost seats to liberals and greens , nor that far-right nationalists gained less than anticipated .
it is that citizens voted in much larger numbers than anyone expected .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
we know that hitler did intend to destroy every last jewish man , woman , and child .
even though mass killings are not rare in history , hitler ’s extermination plan was , if not unique , certainly highly unusual .
however , the laudable effort to prevent such a thing from recurring has had unfortunate consequences .
for , in our zeal to learn lessons from history , we often learn the wrong ones , or distort history towards dubious ends .
in a way , the killings at srebrenica also were affected by the memories of world war ii .
democratic principles call for organizing society in such a way that both values can be realized to the greatest possible extent .
but the path for particularistic action that does not undermine the liberty and equality of all citizens is narrow .
this is a paradox intrinsic to democracy , and it is the duty of politicians to deal with the tensions to which it gives rise .
yet it is also the duty of citizens to preserve the formal , political meaning of citizenship as state intervention broadens to ensure the well being of all .
this might restrict political freedom in the name of greater equality .
do these figures reflect alarming imbalances or are they the usual signs of a boom ?
if america ’s rate of growth in the coming decades remains what it has been over the past thirty years , the answer is simple , and terrifying .
stock market prices would be much too high .
households would be behaving in a totally irresponsible manner .
the exterior imbalance would be unjustifiable , indeed , unsustainable .
baverez 's evidence of degeneration is not as convincing as he believes .
for example , he cites the draining away of industrial jobs as the most glaring evidence of france 's decline .
but deindustrialization is common to all advanced countries .
indeed , france does actually better than most of its rich country rivals and , unlike germany , the uk , or the us , has retained the same global market share in the industrial sector that it had in the early 1970 's .
moreover , according to a better measure of comptetitiveness , foreign investment , france does very well .
a second lesson that i learned is also useful for the eu , which finds itself in a world in which new powers are emerging and where all actors from manila to algiers , from doha to libreville , must deal with the challenges of globalization and interdependence on a daily basis .
that lesson is that europe has more friends than it has enemies in the world .
these friends deserve respect and attention .
if italy and the eu had not understood the need to work with non-european countries , and make them feel that they were responsible and fully-fledged protagonists , the efforts to establish the icc and be so close to declare a universal moratorium on the death penalty would have failed .
i know that this is not exactly a new lesson , but it is what i have in mind when i think of efficient multilateralism .
the problem is that empathy for american workers is in tension with empathy for workers in mexico and china , who would be even worse off without jobs than their american counterparts are .
empathy makes us kinder to people with whom we empathize .
that ’s good , but it also has a darker side .
trump , in his campaign speeches , made use of the tragic murder of kate steinle by an undocumented immigrant to stoke support for his anti-immigrant policies .
he did not , of course , offer any similarly vivid portrayals of undocumented immigrants who have saved the lives of strangers , although such cases have been reported .
financial markets and institutions with global reach need a global macro-prudential regulator , not just a loosely organized college of supervisors .
or it could be that national policymakers do n’t trust the imf , given that it essentially missed the global financial crisis .
if so , the fund needs to win back their confidence .
this brings us to the imf ’s fourth role , namely using its bully pulpit to warn of risks created by large-country policies .
small countries are subject to market discipline , as any latvian will tell you .
provided there is no downward pressure on money wages from increased competition for work , the automatic effect of technological innovation is to raise the standard of living .
this is the famous argument of friedrich hayek against any attempt by governments or central banks to stabilize the price level .
in any technologically progressive economy , prices should fall except in a few niche markets .
businessmen do n’t need low inflation to expand production .
they need only the prospect of more sales .
in other words , while its population is slightly larger than that of china or india , its economy is about half the size of china ’s , but larger than japan ’s and more than twice the size of india ’s .
these divergences help to explain why a number of new acronymic groupings have since been carved out of the n-11 , including the mint ( mexico , indonesia , nigeria , turkey ) and the mist ( swapping in south korea for nigeria ) .
i did n’t devise these groupings , but i have come to be associated with them , having produced a bbc radio documentary on the mint countries in 2014 .
at any rate , they were in keeping with earlier points i had raised ; namely , that by 2010 , mexico , indonesia , south korea , and turkey would each account for more than 1 % of global gdp .
eight years later , the mist economies still have a chance to account for around 2-3 % of world gdp in the future .
the brilliance of the russian innovation in information warfare was to combine existing technologies with a degree of deniability that remained just below the threshold of overt attack .
us intelligence agencies alerted president barack obama of the russian tactics , and he warned putin of adverse consequences when the two met in september 2016 .
but obama was reluctant to call out russia publicly or to take strong actions for fear that russia would escalate by attacking election machinery or voting rolls and jeopardize the expected victory of hillary clinton .
after the election , obama went public and expelled russian spies and closed some diplomatic facilities , but the weakness of the us response undercut any deterrent effect .
and because president donald trump has treated the issue as a political challenge to the legitimacy of his victory , his administration also failed to take strong steps .
cambridge – this year ’s presidential election campaign in the united states is certainly unique .
donald trump has shaken up the way a campaign is run , how a nominee communicates with voters , and the republican party ’s platform , with many of his positions deviating from gop tradition .
but , on tax policy , trump has toed the party line – and that ’s not a good thing .
of course , any assessment of trump ’s declared positions risks being rendered meaningless within a few hours .
he changes his positions with head-spinning frequency , repeatedly disavowing statements soon after making them .
this year alone , the sources of discord with russia have multiplied and deepened .
russia has withdrawn from a number of nuclear agreements , and the kremlin recently placed iskander missiles , which can transport medium-range nuclear devices , in kaliningrad , near the polish border .
moreover , the ukrainian crisis is far from resolved : the minsk ceasefire agreements are not respected , and armed conflict may escalate at any moment .
and it seems likely that russia has been intervening directly in the internal politics of western democracies , using leaks of sensitive documents and financing right-wing populists , from marine le pen to donald trump , who would be supportive of the kremlin .
then there is russia ’s role in syria .
so it seems we are friends again – or perhaps just resting before the dispute resumes .
but the deeper question remains : why has trump repeatedly attacked america ’s oldest and most reliable ally ?
why does he seem to despise the eu so deeply ?
why should the us try to undermine europe , rather than seeking closer cooperation to protect its economic and geopolitical interests ?
trump ’s approach is particularly striking given that china ’s rapid emergence as a strategic rival is america ’s main national security issue .
the report – the product of several months of debate within the german foreign-policy and security community – identifies germany ’s current values and interests as a commitment to “ human dignity , freedom , democracy , the rule of law , and to an international order that is based on universal norms . ”
as gauck proclaimed , germany ’s “ overriding strategic objective ” must be the “ preservation and continued adaptation ” of this order .
to achieve this objective , germany must become a “ shaping power , ” a state with the ability to solve problems and resolve conflicts affecting all or part of the international community .
the traditional determinants of states ’ power relative to other states – geography , demography , economic heft , and military might , coupled with the availability of resources and technological proficiency – remain important ; but they are often insufficient to confer actual influence in international politics .
a shaping power builds relationships and invests in institutions that allow it to work well with others and to create and mobilize “ coalitions and networks of like-minded states . ”
and he implicitly condemned gazprom ’s monopolistic policies , promising to assist poland in the diversification of its gas supplies .
he did not utter a single negative word about the european union , germany , or france .
with his performance , trump managed to draw enthusiasm from across the political spectrum , not just from the pis-curated crowds , thanks partly to his public greeting of the opposition leader lech wałęsa , who was booed by pis supporters and remains a constant target of jarosław kaczyński , poland ’s unelected strongman leader .
even radek sikorski , a former foreign minister and an outspoken critic of the pis government , concluded : “ i believe that trump ’s speech was very well done .
he made strong allusions to poland ’s history and was very flattering to us as poles . ”
given that all of this activity is taking place in the offshore renminbi market , which is small in scale and has only limited connections to mainland china ’s financial system – the result of china ’s hesitancy about financial-market liberalization and capital-account convertibility – the situation remains controllable .
add to that china ’s other strengths – annual gdp of over $ 10 trillion , a growth rate at least four percentage points higher than the global average , $ 3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves , a savings rate of 40 % of gdp , and a massive trade surplus – and an exchange-rate crisis seems highly unlikely .
but that does not mean that there are no risks .
on the contrary , china has a strong interest in curbing the volatility – and , given china ’s centrality to the global economy , so does the rest of the world .
the key will be to get markets and policymakers on the same page .
many polish bishops almost openly declare to their flock : you are supposed to listen , not think or argue .
faith is a matter of the heart .
if your behavior is good - ie , you do not drink , beat your wife and , of course , give money to the church - you are fine .
even young men studying for the priesthood receive very weak philosophical training and that is done purposefully .
in a church that boasts of saint thomas aquinas , such " know-nothingism " seems startling .
as in all democracies where the rule of law prevails , members of a specific profession , including journalists , are not granted any form of immunity from these types of serious criminal charges .
freedom of expression and of the press are guaranteed by turkey ’s constitution and statutes .
for the last 13 years , the turkish government has proved to be the main guarantor of freedom of expression , particularly through its reform of the judiciary .
furthermore , it should be noted that more than 7,000 newspapers and magazines are published in turkey , with a total daily circulation of nearly five million copies .
of the country ’s five most widely read newspapers , four favor the opposition over the government .
indeed , there are some signs that the authorities are doing just this in the south china sea .
nationalism could become the primary source of legitimacy for a ruling party that can no longer point to a rapidly rising standard of living .
the us and others will need to push back to ensure that china does not act on such a temptation .
but these countries would be equally wise to signal to china that it is welcome to take its place among the world ’s leading countries if it acts responsibly and according to the rules set for all .
but the bigger policy choices will be china ’s to make .
in my view , bubbles are social epidemics , fostered by a sort of interpersonal contagion .
a bubble forms when the contagion rate goes up for ideas that support a bubble .
but contagion rates depend on patterns of thinking , which are difficult to judge .
big speculative bubbles are rare events .
( little bubbles , in the price of , say , individual stocks , happen all the time , and do n’t qualify as an answer to the question . )
the century just ended was rough on simplistic ideologies , both of left and right .
socialism had its day in court , and was found wanting .
the great communist experiment is virtually over ( save for a few holdouts , such as cuba and north korea ) .
the ideology of the right , as represented by the washington consensus of neo-liberal , market fundamentalism , was n’t much more successful , even if its failures often go unacknowledged .
the last half-century has shown that while development is possible , it is not inevitable .
by collecting or purchasing large voter data sets , campaigns can segment the electorate into strategic clusters using complex algorithms , and then deliver personalized online content to the most susceptible voters .
microtargeting has proved most effective not at winning over undecided voters , but at dissuading people from voting altogether .
there is strong evidence to suggest that donald trump ’s microtargeting operation in the 2016 us presidential election played a decisive role in the key states that he needed to win the electoral college .
second , with intra-eu migration having increased , there are now almost 15 million europeans residing in eu countries other than their own .
as populists well know , it is notoriously difficult to vote from abroad in eu elections , owing to difficulties registering in host countries , a paucity of polling stations , and overly complex absentee-voting procedures .
at the same time , the rest of the world may not be willing to build up claims against china – at least not on the scale required for a viable reserve currency .
even if chinese authorities managed to achieve full convertibility and tradability for the renminbi , there is no guarantee that it would actually become a global reserve currency for the simple reason that reserve currencies are not easily established .
indeed , over three centuries of globalization , only three “ currencies ” have dominated : gold , the british pound , and the us dollar .
though the deutschemark , the swiss franc , and the japanese yen have all offered viable alternatives to the dollar since world war ii , often providing better stores of value that are less prone to inflation , none has made lasting inroads into the dollar ’s share of global foreign-exchange reserves .
it is also perhaps no accident that global financial centers and reserve currencies have emerged largely in countries where the rule of law is well established , and where foreigners do not face potential legal discrimination .
in considering which lessons of germany ’s turnaround should be applied to other eurozone countries , one must distinguish between what government can do and what remains the responsibility of business , workers , and society at large .
the one area in which government clearly is in charge is public finance .
in 2003 , germany ran a fiscal deficit that was close to 4 % of gdp – perhaps not high by today ’s standards , but higher than the eu average at the time .
today , germany has a balanced budget , whereas most other eurozone countries are running deficits that are higher than germany ’s ten years ago .
the turnaround in germany ’s public finances was due mostly to a reduction in expenditure .
and if we can no longer rely on laboratory experiments to test causality , we must test it in the real world , using massive volumes of real-time data .
this involves moving beyond the closed , question-and-answer process typical of the lab , and applying our ideas in society , earlier and more frequently than ever before .
to see how things work in reality , we must construct living laboratories – that is , communities willing to try new ways of doing things ( to be blunt , to act as guinea pigs ) .
an example of such a living lab is the “ open data city , ” which i launched with the city of trento in italy , along with telecom italia , telefónica , the research university fondazione bruno kessler , the institute for data driven design , and local companies .
importantly , this living lab has the approval and informed consent of all involved ; they understand that they are participating in a gigantic experiment whose goal is to create a better way of living .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
because the eu lacks an army or a central secret service , it must use economic policies to achieve its geopolitical aims .
but the way europe ’s policy toolkit works in practice suggests that it is not well suited for exercising power abroad .
canberra – trade-offs are an inherent part of life .
we all recognize this from our private budgets .
to fix the roof , we may have to accept a less extravagant summer vacation .
when we pick a cheaper wine , we can splurge on dessert .
trade-offs also pervade environmental policy : cutting more of one pollutant , for example , leaves fewer resources to address other issues .
london – the british election called by prime minister theresa may for june 8 will transform the outlook for britain ’s politics and its relationship with europe , but not necessarily in the way that a vastly increased majority for may ’s conservative party might seem to imply .
the scorched-earth defeat that conservative euroskeptics expect to inflict on britain ’s internationalist and progressive forces was symbolized by the daily mail headline on may ’s election announcement : “ crush the saboteurs . ”
but june ’s resounding victory could ultimately lead to an even more stunning reversal , like napoleon ’s hubristic march on moscow after he had destroyed all opposition in western europe .
britain ’s pro-european progressive forces could still snatch victory from the jaws of defeat for three related reasons .
first , by bringing forward the british election , may has effectively extended the deadline for britain ’s withdrawal from the european union from 2019 until 2022 .
elsewhere , of course , this sort of turmoil has democratic safety valves .
it is more than odd to argue that the rest of the world has to cope with a built-in advantage for china ’s exporters because its authoritarian political system can not cope with any change .
no wonder the impressive premier is thought to favor some political loosening .
from east to west , politics seems to be operating in a manner that is , to be diplomatic , sub-optimal .
then again , maybe we ’re lucky that things are n’t worse .
princeton – the largest unresolved issue in the european union is mobility .
the integration process was intended to make it easier and more attractive for europeans to move from one country to another .
according to this vision , the eu ’s inhabitants had the nation to lose and a continent to gain .
but some recent election results indicate that they are more worried about losing the nation .
ever since the 1986 single european act removed restrictions on working in other member countries , the continent has been a single labor market – at least in theory .
one option would be greater federalism .
common political institutions , accountable to voters across the eurozone , would provide a democratic fiscal counterpart to the ecb and help cage german power .
but increasing animosity among eurozone member states , and the erosion of support for european integration in both creditor and debtor countries , means greater federalism is politically unfeasible – and potentially even dangerous .
a better option would be to move toward a more flexible eurozone , in which elected national representatives have a greater say .
with the no-bailout rule restored , governments would have more space to pursue countercyclical policies and respond to voters ’ changing priorities .
bogota , lima , santiago – international economic coordination is as necessary as it is elusive .
during the global financial crisis , the g-20 became the primary forum to agree on basic principles in areas such as the fiscal-policy response and the role of the international monetary fund .
by underscoring the need to avoid trade protectionism and other beggar-thy-neighbor policies , it also put some pressure on governments concerning what not to do .
in these respects , the g-20 was clearly a step forward .
lately , however , as the g-20 has tried to reconcile divergent national economic interests and recovery strategies , it has been far less successful relative to its initial meetings in washington and london in 2009 .
cambridge – back in august , the business roundtable , which comprises the chief executive officers of america ’s largest companies – with combined annual revenues of more than $ 7 trillion – updated its long-standing statement regarding corporate purpose .
it ’s not just about shareholders , the ceos say ; their firms must be committed to all stakeholders , including customers , employees , suppliers , communities , and the environment .
in fact , shareholders came in last on the ceos ’ new list .
and the statement ’s principal author , in his apparent exhilaration , is reported to have said that he felt like thomas jefferson drafting the declaration of independence .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
for example , neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus that is suppressed by acute and chronic stress is elevated by many antidepressant treatments .
still , one of the problems with many of the current medications is that , even with treatment , the recurrence of major depression is very high - around 70-80 % .
this suggests that physiological processes underlying depression - the ones that may also lead to structural changes in the brain - are not being completely arrested , and thus that a new generation of anti-depressant medications is urgently needed .
if so , new , the new antidepressants would have to target what appear to be progressive neurodegenerative changes in the brain , which we infer are taking place because recurrence of depression is so high under currently available treatments .
lithium , a mood stabilizer and neuroprotective agent , has the properties we are seeking , although its toxicity makes it less than ideal .
tiger parenting aims at getting children to make the most of what abilities they have , and so seems to lean towards the “ clever ” side of the “ clever or happy ” choice .
that ’s also the view of betty ming liu , who blogged in response to chua ’s article : “ parents like amy chua are the reason why asian-americans like me are in therapy . ”
stanley sue , a professor of psychology at the university of california , davis , has studied suicide , which is particularly common among asian-american women ( in other ethnic groups , more males commit suicide than females ) .
he believes that family pressure is a significant factor .
chua would reply that reaching a high level of achievement brings great satisfaction , and that the only way to do it is through hard work .
in some cases , they are individuals like president hugo chávez of venezuela ( and other latin american leaders ) or italy ’s ex-prime minister silvio berlusconi .
mostly they enter the political scene from the fringes but manage to form a highly personalized grouping , like jörg haider and his austrian freedom party , jean-marie lepen and his french nationalists , andrzej lepper and his polish peasant party , or prime minister robert fico and his direction in slovakia .
many other names could be added to the list .
the list tells us two things .
one is that a surprising number of populist leaders have managed to get themselves into power in recent years .
fewer and fewer people are bothering to get married , and marriage is regarded less and less as a lifelong union .
families are having fewer and fewer children , and more and more children are born out of wedlock .
so one of the “ unintended consequences ” of the bill might be to add welcome recruits to the ranks of the married , even if these recruits are of a historically unusual kind .
after much soul-searching , i voted for the bill , though without any acute sense that i was striking a blow for freedom .
there is a clear status benefit to the minority ; no obvious harm is being done to the majority ; and the long-term consequences are unfathomable .
ronald reagan was a master of the well selected anecdote .
setting the right example is another crucial form of communication for leaders .
anticipating a skeptical public reaction when singapore raised the salaries of government officials in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong announced that he would forgo the raise himself .
in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis , some business executives voluntarily reduced their salaries as a means of communicating concern for their employees and public opinion .
during the 2008 presidential election campaign , obama proved to be a talented communicator .
london – current antibiotics are becoming increasingly ineffective , not only at fighting common illnesses like pneumonia and urinary tract infections , but also at treating a range of infections , such as tuberculosis and malaria , which now risk again becoming incurable .
with the g-7 leaders having committed , in a recent joint declaration , to tackle “ antimicrobial resistance ” ( amr ) , it is time for the more inclusive g-20 – and china , as it chairs the group for the first time – to take the fight to the next level .
failure to address amr will affect everyone , regardless of their nationality or their country ’s level of development .
indeed , by 2050 , ten million people could be dying as a result of amr , up from around 700,000 today , with china and india each housing about one million sufferers .
at that point , an estimated $ 100 trillion in global gdp will already have been lost .
sydney – the appointment of five provincial-level chinese communist party chiefs in early december is a reminder that the ascension of china ’s next generation of leaders , who will take power in 2012 , may be the most significant development in chinese politics since deng xiaoping ’s reign begin in 1978 .
the upcoming generation of leaders will be the first with little or no personal memory of the turmoil and hardship endured during the mao zedong years .
forgetting that history might doom china to repeat the mistakes of the past ; but , for better or worse , it might also ease constraints and set its leaders free .
all five appointees were born after the founding of the people ’s republic in 1949 .
two of them , hu chunhua and sun zhengcai , are only 46 years old .
finally , there is the chaos scenario .
for example , a cyber superbug destroys the networks on which our way of life has come to depend , leading to economic , demographic , and environmental collapse .
in this set of possible outcomes , one point stands out : the uncertainty of europe ’s role in the future global system .
to prevent inexorable decline , europe must reach clear decisions on three fundamental issues .
first , eu leaders must determine how to resolve the eurozone crisis .
but bank deleveraging ( brought about by stiffer regulatory requirements ) , together with negative interest rates , caused financial institutions ’ equity prices to fall , leading to further pro-cyclical destruction of value through price deflation , increasing illiquidity , and crowded exits .
past experience has taught china ’s real engineers that the only way to escape deflation is through painful structural reforms – not easy money and competitive devaluation .
the question is whether the us and other reserve-currency countries will share the burden of maintaining global currency stability , through an agreement resembling the 1985 plaza accord , in which five major economies agreed to depreciate the us dollar against the japanese yen and the german deutsche mark .
if not , why would asia ’s net lenders , especially china , continue funding speculation against themselves ?
the us dollar is a safe haven , but savers in need of liquidity still lack an impartial lender of last resort .
and a good deal of traffic – with new cars smuggled in through tunnels beneath the “ philadelphi route ” that runs along the egyptian border .
but real life is also traumatic and limited .
we saw buildings – not just the former hamas headquarters – still in rubble .
houses are riddled with bullet holes .
there is no electricity for up to eight hours a day .
many central bankers are like the proverbial general who plans to fight the last war .
but unlike backward-looking military strategy , flawed monetary policies produce inevitable damage , not merely worrisome risks .
despite having conquered inflation , central bankers continue to fight it and as a result may fail to confront the latest economic menace - global deflation .
falling prices have paralyzed japan 's economy for a decade .
china and hong kong have seen prices plummet recently too .
even if the us now absents itself from the jcpoa , it has only two means to block the implementation of the agreement between iran and the rest of the world .
the first would be to foment war .
this clearly is on the us agenda , especially with the neoconservative doyen john bolton back in the white house as national security adviser .
the world must steadfastly resist another ruinous us military adventure .
extraterritorial sanctions are the second way the us could kill the jcpoa .
it was presumably in response to this impasse that china pressed ahead with establishing the aiib .
the size of china ’s economy – and its resulting diplomatic weight – is a fact that can not be wished away .
a strategy of containment worked well for america and its allies during the cold war , but it can not be applied today without flexibility and strategic common sense .
critics of america ’s policy point out that even if the us had thwarted the effort to establish the aiib , china would continue to project power in asia , and around the rest of the world , one way or another .
channeling that influence through a newly created international organization , they argue , is more likely to temper raw power grabs .
tel aviv – us president-elect donald trump has said a lot about foreign affairs , without really saying anything at all .
his muddled statements offer little insight into what kind of foreign policy he will actually pursue , and there is not much reason to believe that , when his approach does become clear , it will be what the united states – or the world – needs .
trump is a businessman , not a statesman .
he thinks in terms of immediate profits and losses – a worldview that is exemplified in his declarations that us allies need to contribute more to security alliances .
at a time of evolving challenges and growing threats , adhering to this narrow-minded , isolationist approach is unlikely to do anyone much good .
in 2009 , business accounted for 75 % of r & d funding in japan , 73 % in south korea , 72 % in china , 67 % in germany , and 60 % in the us , whose companies are the largest r & d investors in terms of absolute purchasing power , spending more than twice as much as japanese businesses .
but business investment as a share of gdp has changed very little in the us over the last decade , while it has risen rapidly in many other countries , including china , singapore , south korea , and israel .
global multinational companies are the largest business-sector r & d investors in the us and other countries .
for example , multinational companies , whether headquartered in the us or elsewhere , accounted for about 84 % of private ( non-bank ) r & d investment in the us in 2009 , about the same as a decade earlier .
and us multinationals still locate about 84 % of their r & d activities in the us , often in innovation clusters around research universities .
beijing – measured by the percentage of people living in its cities , china ’s urbanization rate currently stands at about 48 % , according to official statistics .
given that the share of city dwellers was only 18 % just 30 years ago , this is remarkable progress .
but it is still unsatisfactory , because most other countries at a similar stage of development experienced faster urbanization than industrialization .
china ’s urbanization has lagged behind its industrialization , which now is around 70 % when measured by the percentage of the labor force whose income is derived mainly from non-farm activities .
another striking difference between china and some other developing countries is that chinese cities , large and small , lack any sign of significant urban poverty or slums .
implementing democracy , with or without regime change , was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism .
today , iraq may be on the verge of civil war between shiites and sunnis .
iran under a new and more radical president is moving irresistibly towards possessing a nuclear capacity .
a free electoral process brought hamas to power in palestine , and the unfortunate episode of the danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between islam and the west .
all of these developments are paving the way to new interpretations .
this made it easier for lula in particular to buck his socialist allies and distance himself from chávez , having as recently as march 2008 backed chávez following colombia ’s brief incursion into ecuador which killed farc commander raul reyes .
calderón ’s uncompromising hard line on drug dealers in mexico , an unrelenting offensive that follows the precedent set by uribe in dealing with the farc , has also been helped because economic growth has muted domestic opposition .
the emerging uribe-lula-calderón troika has geo-strategic influence because things have started to change in cuba ever since fidel castro formally handed over the presidency to his brother , raúl .
latin america is obsessed with this transition , and uribe , calderón , and lula have no intention of letting chávez lead the way .
last january , lula visited the island with a string of leading brazilian businessmen and signed trade and investment deals worth $ 1 billion .
before our eyes , a tragedy in several acts is unfolding , in which the players and their aims are clear .
what is not known is how many more acts this sad political spectacle will have , and thus when – and how – it will end .
the first act began in the fall of 2013 , when then-ukrainian president viktor yanukovych duped the european union and its leaders by refusing to sign a long-planned association agreement .
instead , he chose to have ukraine enter a customs union with russia , in exchange for a pile of cash and cheap oil and natural gas .
russian president vladimir putin seemed to have achieved his political aim , namely to bring ukraine , which had been drifting toward europe throughout the post-soviet period , firmly back into the kremlin ’s sphere of influence .
although the number of participants has increased from the original 15 to 25 , most countries do not have a voice .
but there is a larger question lurking behind the gge : can norms really limit state behavior ?
most experts agree that a global cyberspace treaty currently would be politically impossible ( though russia and china have made such proposals at the un ) .
but , beyond formal treaties , normative constraints on states also include codes of conduct , conventional state practices , and widely shared expectations of proper behavior among a group ( which create a common law ) .
in scope , these constraints can vary from global , to plurilateral , to bilateral .
of course , monetary policy also has redistributive effects .
think about the different effects of interest rates on debtors versus creditors .
however , monetary policy is a much more awkward , indirect and imprecise way of choosing winners and losers than fiscal policy .
independent central banks can occasionally be a pain for politicians , but at least they can be used as scapegoats when necessary-a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of losing control over a useful tool .
these considerations should guide the choice of what will follow the stability pact in europe .
unlike the us , china did not suffer from a liquidity shortage and a credit crunch during the global financial crisis .
thus , low interest rates and non-market interference , rather than demand from enterprises , fueled explosive credit growth in the first half of 2009 , surpassing the full-year target .
if commercial banks had been allowed to base lending decisions solely on economic considerations , credit and money supply would have grown more slowly , limiting the risk of rising bad-loan ratios , stalled enterprise reform , inflationary pressure , and a resurgence of asset bubbles as excess liquidity enters equity and real-estate markets .
indeed , china ’s housing prices have been skyrocketing in recent months .
the government was too generous in helping revive real-estate demand , and , overwhelmed by fear of the negative impact of falling asset prices on economic growth , has been too cautious in dealing with bubbles when they have reappeared .
now a constitutional reform supposedly aimed at “ promoting turkey ’s eu membership ” would further curb the army ’s role as the guardian of the secular state and strengthen government control of the judiciary .
erdogan ’s islamic revolution has also expanded into the educational system with the introduction of a markedly religious curriculum .
to back turkey ’s strategic shift , a new law has recently made the teaching of arabic obligatory in schools .
it is difficult to imagine a more symbolic blow to ataturk ’s vision .
erdogan believes that , by exercising turkey ’s capacity for mediation , he will recover the burden of his ottoman forbears as the guarantors of peace and security in the mashreq .
he remained skeptical about notions of irreversible progress .
change for the better could emerge only from practical initiatives , not from sunday speeches .
thus , european integration had to be created by real policies and institutions , not by decree .
so he and giscard created the european council ( composed of the heads of europe ’s governments ) , which is now a major player in the european union ’s institutional set-up .
they pushed forward the idea of monetary integration , which came to fruition a generation later .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
for britain , the prospects are suddenly much clearer and better than at any time since june 2016 .
while the likelihood that prime minister theresa may will soon be ousted could create the impression of a constitutional crisis , the reality is that political conditions are sure to stabilize once the period for renegotiating the uk-eu relationship is extended again from the new , very soft , april 12 deadline until the end of the year or beyond .
it no longer dreams of becoming the “ united states of europe , ” and jacques delors ’ suggestion of “ the united nations of europe ” has remained too ambivalent , if not deliberately ambiguous , to be effective .
after the irish “ no , ” can the union find salvation in nato ’s idea of a “ coalition of the willing ” ?
can the most determined pro-integration europeans leave the pack without being paralyzed by the coalition of the unwilling ?
of course , the irish “ no ” is not the equivalent for the eu of what the afghan quagmire represents for nato .
yet it also constitutes a major setback and challenge of an institutional , political , and even psychological nature .
what is also required is a dose of realism .
the struggle against the islamic state is not a conventional war .
we can not eradicate or destroy it any time soon , as it is as much a network and an idea as it is an organization and a de facto state that controls territory and resources .
indeed , terrorism is and will continue to be one of the scourges of this era .
the good news , though , is that the threat posed by the islamic state to the middle east and the rest of the world can be dramatically reduced through sustained , concerted action .
failing that , the left will come to power and reverse years of reform and progress .
but a currency board will also help to start financial intermediation for the benefit of small and medium sized firms who have been starved of capital by the experience of recurrent crisis and bad credit .
small and medium sized firms need to become part of mexican capitalism .
mexico 's economy has had a good few years now ; not very hard to achieve given a booming america next door and great liquidity in global capital markets .
mexico 's own skillful success at rebuilding opec ( boosting the value of its oil exports ) contributed to good performance as did the determination to hang on to and even widen the reforms of mr. zedilla 's predecessor , president salinas .
it requires a sense of social responsibility that accompanies and cushions the painful process of modernization .
people who are suspended between a lost past and a future not yet gained need help .
such assistance will not yield immediate results , but awareness of the medium term - which means readiness to face it by delaying immediate gratification - is also a sign of a liberal order .
thus , fighting al qaeda is not a war .
it is partly self-defense , partly an assertion of the rule of law in difficult circumstances , and partly a constructive effort to redress the causes of frustration .
groups like the syrian national council are loose associations of individuals and groups , many of them outside syria .
these are the groups criticized by the obama administration and others for their failure to present a united front , formulate a credible agenda , or be seen as a viable alternative to the current regime .
but these groups have limited influence over the local opposition groups inside syria , which are equally diverse and divided .
it is among these groups that radical islamists have gained a foothold .
fear of another islamist takeover is a second main argument against toppling assad , but the longer he stays in power , the greater the gains made by islamists on the ground .
but this was not a case of over-regulating and over-reaching .
on the contrary , 30 years of financial deregulation , made possible by capturing the hearts and minds of regulators , and of politicians on both sides of the aisle , gave a narrow private-sector elite – mostly on wall street – almost all the upside of the housing boom .
the downside was shoved onto the rest of society , particularly the relatively uneducated and underpaid , who now have lost their houses , their jobs , their hopes for their children , or all of the above .
these people did not cause the crisis .
but they are paying for it .
the recent downturn in france ’s industrial output has created large trade deficits , and is undermining the competitiveness of small and medium-size enterprises .
unemployment stands at about 11 % , with a record-high 3.3 million workers registered as jobless in october .
at the same time , political crisis is impeding the government ’s pursuit of difficult reforms .
french leaders have demonstrated an inability to communicate effectively or apply past experiences in analyzing current threats .
instead , they are resorting to diversionary tactics by engaging in overblown rhetorical battles about minor controversies .
mumbai – as india gears up for its general election next month , it has some cause to celebrate : extreme poverty is finally in retreat .
in 2012 – two decades after the government launched a series of economic reforms aimed at opening up the economy – the official poverty rate had reached 22 % , less than half the rate in 1994 .
but it is time for india to raise its aspirations .
escaping abject destitution , though an important milestone , is not the same as achieving a decent standard of living and sense of economic security .
to that end , there is still much to be done .
once the march to war had begun , there was not much room left for diplomacy .
yet , far from making space for diplomacy , trump adviser sebastian gorka recently told the press that , “ the idea that secretary tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical . ”
but why should n’t america ’s top diplomat have significant influence over military matters ?
if this does not change soon , we may , as then-british prime minister david lloyd george wrote of world war i , “ [ muddle ] into war ” yet again .
south korean political leaders must also avoid being swept up by this intensifying war rhetoric .
alemán , too , faces a rebellion in his liberal constitutional party ( plc ) , led by former treasury minister eduardo montealegre , a presidential hopeful popular in the party ’s liberal wing .
if alemán blocks montealegre ’s candidacy in the plc and pushes him to form another political party , ortega ’s chances for winning the presidency increase sharply .
the business interests that finance political campaigns face a difficult dilemma : is it preferable to align with a plc dominated by a corrupt alemán or support a new democratic force and risk helping ortega win ?
although a three-way race is pure speculation at this point , it ’s clear that it offers ortega the best of all electoral worlds .
it ’s so tempting that ortega is likely to help rehabilitate arnoldo alemán , betting that freeing him will serve his political interests .
friedman and keynes both agreed that successful macroeconomic management was necessary - that the private economy on its own might well be subject to unbearable instability ­and that strategic , powerful , but limited economic intervention by the government was necessary to maintain stability .
but , while for keynes , the key was to keep the sum of government spending and private investment stable , for friedman the key was to keep the money supply -- the amount of purchasing power in readily spendable form in the hands of businesses and households -- stable .
a relatively minor , technical difference in means , you might say .
a difference of opinion that rested on different judgments about how the world works , which could ( and ultimately was ) resolved by empirical research , you might say .
and you would be half right .
but speculators are thinking ahead and shifting out of commodities today in anticipation of future higher interest rates in 2015 ; the result has been to bring next year ’s price decrease forward to today .
the fourth of the channels , the exchange rate , has already been functioning .
the prospect of us monetary tightening coincides with moves by the european central bank and the bank of japan toward enhanced monetary stimulus .
the result has been an appreciation of the dollar against the euro and the yen .
the euro is down 8 % against the dollar since the first half of the year and the yen is down 14 % .
i was also aware that the un human rights council had made repeated condemnations of israel over the past two years but had focused little attention on large-scale violations of human rights in other countries .
this pattern of action and inaction by the council has given greater credence to those who believe the un ’s highest human rights body is inherently anti-israel .
i decided i could not undertake the mission for these reasons .
i am aware that judge goldstone , a dedicated and unimpeachable human rights lawyer and advocate , shared similar concerns when he was initially approached .
but he was able to work with the council ’s president to secure an agreement he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to allow his team to address the actions taken by both parties to the conflict .
in the early cold war , communism and the soviet union had considerable soft power .
many communists led the resistance against fascism in europe , and many people believed that communism was the wave of the future .
but soviet soft power was undercut by the exposure of stalin ’s crimes in 1956 , and by the repression in hungary in 1956 , czechoslovakia in 1968 , and poland in 1981 .
although in theory communism aimed to establish a system of class justice , lenin ’s heirs maintained domestic power through a brutal security apparatus involving lethal purges , gulags , broad censorship , and ubiquitous informants .
the net effect of these brutal measures was a general loss of faith in the system .
coronado , california – most people do not think of charles darwin as a psychologist .
in fact , his work revolutionized the field .
before darwin , philosophical speculation shaped our psychological understanding .
but even great philosophers – plato , aristotle , hobbes , hume , locke , kant , schopenhauer , nietzsche , and others – could only describe current mental events and behaviors ; they could not explain their causes .
darwin provided the profound understanding that evolution has influenced the shape of our minds as strongly as it has the shape of our bodies .
indeed , evaluating the impact of any research project is difficult .
as marc kirschner , a professor at harvard medical school , pointed out in a thoughtful editorial in the journal science : “ one may be able to recognize good science as it happens , but significant science can only be viewed in the rear-view mirror . ”
even preeminent researchers may underestimate the significance of their findings at the time they obtain them .
when salvador luria , my university microbiology professor , received the 1969 nobel prize in physiology or medicine , he made the point eloquently , sending a humorous cartoon to all who had congratulated him on the award .
it depicted an elderly couple at the breakfast table .
and , when fully implemented ( in 2027 ) , it will increase taxes on a majority of americans in the middle ( the second , third , and fourth quintiles ) .
the us tax code was already regressive long before trump ’s presidency .
indeed , the billionaire investor warren buffett , one of the wealthiest men in the world , famously complained that it was wrong that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary .
the new legislation makes america ’s tax system even more regressive .
it is now universally recognized that growing inequality is a key economic problem in the united states , with those at the top capturing almost all the gains in gdp over the past quarter-century .
a critical question now confronting policymakers is whether gig workers should be classified as independent contractors or as employees of the platform companies with which they have employment contracts and for whose customers they provide services .
california , a us state with more than two million independent contractors , has attempted to resolve this question with a new law , california assembly bill 5 , which codifies the legal criteria for determining how to categorize workers .
applying the three-part “ abc test ” that many states already use to determine whether a worker is eligible for unemployment insurance , ab5 makes it considerably harder for businesses to classify their workers as independent contractors rather than employees .
to win political support for ab5 ’s passage , lawmakers exempted many types of independent contractors – such as doctors , dentists , and real-estate agents – on the grounds that they set their own compensation rates , communicate directly with their customers , and earn at least twice the minimum wage .
but ab5 does cover the more than 400,000 workers who drive for platform companies like the ride-sharing services uber and lyft and the food-delivery firm doordash .
making matters worse , the modi government has , for the first time ever , invoked section 7 of the rbi act , which allows it to issue directions directly to the central bank governor on matters of public interest .
the modi government ’s willingness to go to such lengths suggests that more than interest rates are at stake .
the government is particularly unhappy with rbi measures to clean up india ’s banks , many of which are burdened by a large volume of non-performing assets , and prevent risks from building up in other parts of the financial system .
these measures are squeezing state-owned banks ’ ability to lend to politically connected clients .
of course , government ministers ca n’t come right out and say that .
as any democratic politician will attest , disappointed expectations may well be the toughest electoral opponent of all .
just ask former french president nicolas sarkozy .
of course , abe did not face the kind of sky-high expectations that sarkozy and , for that matter , us president barack obama did .
it is not that abe ’s 2012 campaign lacked ambition ; he set out a bold economic-reform agenda and promised to boost japan ’s global influence .
but , after two decades of leaders who – with the exception of junichiro koizumi – promised little and achieved less , japanese voters had little reason to expect that abe would follow through on his pledges .
those individuals who carry at least one copy of the gene variant that does not allow the body to metabolize plavix have a 300 % higher risk of clotting a stent .
this variation of the genome is exceptionally common , present in 30 % of individuals of european ancestry and more than 50 % of those of asian ancestry .
in many such patients , doubling the dose of plavix , and checking the platelet function with a point-of-care test to assure suppression , can override the lack of response .
there are alternative drugs , such as prasugrel or ticagrelor , which can be used instead of plavix to bypass the problem .
the story of interferon , given for one year to patients with hepatitis c virus , is particularly striking .
after all , war , in colombia and elsewhere , frequently unites nations , while peace divides them .
the repercussions of a genuine end to the colombian armed conflict would be felt far beyond the country ’s borders .
if chávez ’s venezuela has become a narco-state in which the regime ’s acolytes are drug lords , this reflects their privileged relations with the farc .
repercussions would also be felt in mexico , where drug cartels are tearing apart the country , and the us , the world ’s largest source of demand .
west africa , too , would be affected , having become in recent years the main transit point for south american drugs headed to europe .
at the heart of the budget is the realization that reducing poverty requires both rapid economic growth and targeted investments aimed at the poorest of the poor .
rapid economic growth is to be based on the private sector , including foreign direct investment .
thus , the budget supports critical areas of market reform and growth promotion , including measures aimed at deepening the financial sector , promoting exports , and liberalizing foreign direct investment .
the key , however , is that the budget does not rely simply on " trickle-down " economics to raise living standards .
the second pillar of poverty reduction is targeted investments for the poor , particularly for the rural poor .
in fact , exaggerating the threat of islamist terrorism , while downplaying the threat of right-wing populism , could well play directly into russian president vladimir putin ’s hands .
the struggle to prioritize threats is not exclusive to the west .
in the middle east , countries are trying to figure out who should be contained .
among the frontrunners are the islamic state ( isis ) , iran , and israel .
for israel ( and saudi arabia ) , the answer is clearly iran .
cambridge – us treasury secretary steven mnuchin is hemmed in on all sides .
domestically , he ’s trapped between the promises he has made ( such as the “ mnuchin rule ” that taxes would n’t be cut for the rich ) , the actions of president donald trump ( whose tax plan includes cuts for the rich ) , and simple arithmetic ( which makes the administration ’s conflicting pledges impossible to fulfill ) .
but even on the international stage , where us treasury secretaries typically enjoy more latitude and esteem , mnuchin is likely to have a hard time .
after all , the trump administration has made it clear that it does not intend to fulfill the global leadership commitments that mnuchin ’s predecessors have overseen .
given trump ’s belief that international negotiations are just a forum for making unilateral demands , how could mnuchin – who , like his boss , lacks government experience – persuade other countries that adherence to common rules and norms , such as open trade , is in everyone ’s interest ?
cambridge – how should one evaluate the agreement reached in paris this month at the united nations climate change conference ?
no sooner was the deal announced on december 12 than the debate erupted .
some avid environmentalists were disappointed that the agreement did not commit firmly to limiting global warming to 1.5 º celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050 .
but such a commitment would not have been credible .
what emerged in paris was in fact better , because the negotiators were able to agree on practical steps in the right direction .
muslim professionals , fearing for their safety , began to move into ghettos .
muslim charitable organizations , often funded by saudi arabia and other arab countries , began to move into areas of social life where the state had failed dismally , particularly education .
as a result , thousands of muslim boys were enrolled in school for the first time .
unfortunately , they were educated in religious seminaries espousing a deeply intolerant , fundamentalist brand of islam .
with discrimination soon cutting across class lines , increasing numbers of indian muslims began to look for links with muslim communities elsewhere in the world .
today , private firms employ more of china 's working class than state-owned enterprises ( soes ) .
with a fraction of the resources of the soes , private firms employ much of the proletariat , produce goods demanded by proletarian consumers , and , because of their superior performance , safeguard the interests of proletarian savers by actually paying back their bank loans .
why most pundits miss the fact that workers are protesting , not in the liberal provinces of zhejiang and guangdong , but in the socialist bastions of the northeast , is a mystery .
workers do n't protest against menial jobs in capitalistic wenzhou but against no jobs in socialist shenyang .
the government can not pay unemployed workers their pensions because socialism has bankrupted its finance .
poorer or smaller countries can hardly dream of winning a european championship , as steaua ( romania ) , red star ( serbia ) , or nottingham forest ( now languishing in the english third division ) once did .
but , while we see inequality and exclusion in club-level football , the opposite is true for competitions between national teams .
the average winning margin among the top eight world cup national teams has steadily decreased , from more than two goals in the 1950 ’s , to about 1.5 goals in the 1960 ’s , 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s , and only 0.88 goals in the 2002 world cup .
the same is true of all games played at the final tournament , not only those among the top eight national teams .
the decrease in winning margins is all the more impressive because the world cup has grown from 16 to 32 national teams – many of them new and rather inexperienced .
in fact , the budget assumes the best of all worlds , not the blue chip one in which interest rates remain low but gdp growth ambles along at around 2 % .
with real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates remaining near record lows , a marked increase in long-term growth , as the administration forecasts , would be historically anomalous .
in the omb document , the real interest rate on three-month treasuries is expected to stay below 1 % over the decade .
furthermore , in that projection , the term premium disappears almost entirely .
at present , ten-year treasuries offer more than three times the yield on three-month treasuries .
but that antagonism reflected the personalization of politics achieved by berlusconi , as well as an institutional feature that he abolished .
one of the last acts of his government was to replace the majoritarian electoral system , introduced in 1993 , with proportional rule .
the new electoral system changes the politicians ’ incentives , and could induce a return to shifting coalitions and unstable governments .
this outcome would be accelerated if , as is likely , berlusconi himself were to distance himself from politics in the coming electoral term .
under the new electoral rules , seats are allotted to parties in proportion to votes , but a special provision induces parties to forge pre-electoral agreements : the pre-electoral coalition that wins the most votes receives a seat premium that ensures a comfortable majority in the chamber of deputies ( the lower house ) .
and he has had some success – at the expense of economic growth .
though the current rate of 7 % is comfortable , it is far lower than the double-digit rates that prevailed prior to 2008 .
given the need for further economic restructuring – and in view of long-term demographic trends , which will reduce the labor supply – pre-2008 growth rates are unlikely to be restored .
this is fine with li , who recognizes that structural transformation and industrial upgrading – not an unsustainable credit-led growth model – is the key to achieving high-income status .
but there is more to assessing wen ’s stimulus than the growth/reform trade-off .
the climate challenge demands much deeper cooperation between the public and private sector to increase green investment .
we need to ensure that infrastructure is built to cope with the increased impact of climate change and develop clear global standards for disclosing the climate risks that investment projects pose .
for example , how will a city cope with increased flood risk , and how will agricultural land be maintained productively as droughts grow more severe ?
big and small investors alike should know exactly how their money could be affected by a changing climate .
here , public investment institutions like the european investment bank can assist with adaptation in many ways .
“ more than half of this battle is taking place on the battlefield of the media , [ for ] we are in a media battle in a race for the hearts and minds of [ muslims ] . ”
the speaker was not some public relations executive , but osama bin laden ’s chief lieutenant , ayman al-zawahiri .
terrorists have skillfully adapted to fighting wars in today ’s media age , but , for the most part , america and the governments of the other democracies have not .
consider that the violent extremists have their own “ media relations committees ” aimed at manipulating elite opinion .
they plan and design headline-grabbing attacks using every means of communications to intimidate and break the collective will of free people .
of course , exemplary and punitive damages in order to discourage conduct inimical to society do exist in the statute books .
but philippine courts have refused to resort to the use of such damage awards as a tool for controlling behavior , particularly of businessmen .
recent attempts by filipino lawyers to prosecute civil claims for environmental tort and human rights abuses before american courts demonstrate just how desperate filipino claimants are to seek redress against those who have acted negligently or with impunity .
all of this explains why sulpicio lines , the owner of the princess of the stars , has remained in commercial operations despite its many lapses .
simply put , the philippine courts have not made it sufficiently costly for it to maintain non-seaworthy vessels .
the us congress is considering legislation that allows the trump administration to impose sanctions on european firms taking part in the project , even though these companies are contractually obliged to see the work through .
and , according to gerhard schröder , a former german chancellor who now chairs the pipeline project , the us ambassador to germany has been acting more like an “ occupation officer ” than like a diplomat .
all told , the trump administration ’s disruptive behavior has left the french and german governments furious .
but , beyond fueling anger , trump ’s attacks on other countries ’ sovereignty are adding momentum to a new push for european political unification .
it is no secret that europe is in the midst of an internal economic crisis – a result of the euro saddling southern eurozone countries with high inflation prior to the 2008 financial crash , which severely reduced their competitiveness within the euro system .
all have abolished controls at their shared borders and have adopted a common visa policy for citizens of non-member states .
it is certainly handy to be able to treat a flight from zurich to oslo as a domestic journey , with no passport controls to contend with upon departure and arrival .
and it is undoubtedly convenient to be able to drive from berlin to barcelona without having to wait in line at each border one crosses .
indeed , that convenience is probably why only two eu countries ( ireland and the united kingdom ) have opted out of the schengen agreement .
but the refugee crisis has exposed the flipside of the schengen agreement – namely , the difficulty of monitoring national and eu territory without border controls .
europeans have become dependent on such companies , which are all based in china or america .
yet europe has focused more on enforcing shared values in the tech sector – namely , by strengthening data privacy regulations – than on developing a long-term strategy to become competitive .
defining such a strategy could help europe to identify areas for mutual accommodation .
a third area with potential for strategic cooperation is development aid and investment in the world ’s poorest and most fragile states .
such cooperation is essential to combat terrorism , human trafficking , and migration .
just adding liquidity , while continuing current austerity policies , will not reignite the spanish economy .
so , too , in the us , the smaller banks that largely finance small and medium-size enterprises have been all but neglected .
the federal government – under both president george w. bush and barack obama – allocated hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up the mega-banks , while allowing hundreds of these crucially important smaller lenders to fail .
but lending would be inhibited even if the banks were healthier .
after all , small enterprises rely on collateral-based lending , and the value of real estate – the main form of collateral – is still down one-third from its pre-crisis level .
the world learned that lesson following the 1973 arab-israel war .
arab oil-exporting countries embargoed oil sales to the us and the netherlands to punish them for their support of israel .
but the oil destined for the us and the netherlands was shifted to other countries like japan , while oil destined for other countries found its way to the us and the netherlands .
oil is a fungible commodity , and markets clear at a common price .
when the dust settled , it turned out that american , dutch , and other importers all suffered roughly the same degree of shortfall and paid the same damaging high price .
the world has been horrified by graphic images of the latest crackdown by myanmar ’s military junta .
but the bullets and clubs unleashed on buddhist monks have worked .
the monks have retreated , and an eerie normalcy has returned to yangon ( rangoon ) , myanmar ’s principal city and former capital .
that crackdown continues under cover of darkness .
when the sun sets in myanmar , fear rises .
the underlying issue is whether europe ’s monetary union needs greater integration to manage crises such as greece ’s , or whether it can maintain the current approach , founded on national responsibility and sanctions for those who break the rules .
germany ’s finance minister , wolfgang schäuble , has suggested that those sanctions should include expulsion from the eurozone – something that was never envisaged in the european union ’s 1992 maastricht treaty .
nor , of course , was it ever envisaged that greece would face its current economic trauma .
admittedly , the country ’s economic performance after the oil shock of the early 1970s was poor , marked by slow growth , high inflation and unemployment , huge fiscal deficits , increasing debt , a declining currency , and inadequate infrastructure .
indeed , until the mid-1990s , the government ’s lack of macroeconomic discipline and its tendency to succumb to populist demands and vested interests accounted for much of the country ’s economic weakness .
these include flush toilets , automobiles , electric power , long-distance communications , modern information processing , and so forth .
again , it would have been ludicrously expensive – or simply impossible – to have achieved similar capabilities in earlier periods of history .
in the late roman empire , only a wealthy aristocrat could have purchased a nomenclator – a slave tasked with memorizing names and faces , and reminding the aristocrat of them when social occasions demanded it .
today , having a basic smartphone is better than having an entourage of a dozen , or even thousands , of nomenclator-like assistants .
in thinking about the future of growth , and the opportunities that continued growth will open up for all of humanity , we should reflect on how far we have come .
insofar as this is true , the united states wo n’t be replaced as the dominant power unless and until it abdicates that role .
this may sound simple , but it will have far-reaching consequences for the coming century ’s international order .
the vital interests guiding chinese policy are internal modernization , the ruling regime ’s political stability and survival , and the country ’s unity ( which includes taiwan ) .
these interests are unlikely to change for a long time .
as a result , china will become a largely inward-looking superpower , which – precisely for that reason – will pursue its foreign-policy interests in a completely unsentimental manner .
the government pursued fiscal austerity , but not enough to make up for the vagaries of the market .
the global financial crisis that followed east asia 's crisis set off a series of big exchange rate adjustments .
the dollar , to which argentina 's peso was tied , increased sharply in value .
meanwhile , argentina 's neighbor and mercosur trading partner , brazil , saw its currency depreciate - some say that it became significantly undervalued .
wages and prices fell , but not enough to allow argentina to compete effectively , especially since many of the agricultural goods which constitute argentina 's natural comparative advantages face high hurdles in entering the markets of rich countries .
when such a debt-fueled bubble bursts , its effects are transmitted directly to the real economy via household-sector balance sheets , with the reduction in consumption contributing to a decline in employment and private investment .
it is much harder to find circuit breakers for this dynamic than for , say , that caused by balance-sheet distress in the financial sector .
yet the chinese authorities seem not to have learned the lessons of either episode .
not only did they fail to mitigate the risks , underscored in the 2007 collapse , that new retail investors introduce into the market ; they actually exacerbated them , by allowing , and even encouraging , those investors to accumulate leverage through margin buying .
making matters worse , when the current stock-market correction began in early june , chinese regulators relaxed margin-buying restrictions , while encouraging state-owned enterprises and asset managers to purchase more stocks .
but i doubt that it has .
seventy years ago , john maynard keynes pointed out its fallacy .
when shocks to the system occur , agents do not know what will happen next .
in the face of this uncertainty , they do not readjust their spending ; instead , they refrain from spending until the mists clear , sending the economy into a tailspin .
it is the shock , not the adjustments to it , that spreads throughout the system .
the financial sector has imposed huge externalities on the rest of society .
america ’s financial industry polluted the world with toxic mortgages , and , in line with the well established “ polluter pays ” principle , taxes should be imposed on it .
besides , well-designed taxes on the financial sector might help alleviate problems caused by excessive leverage and banks that are too big to fail .
taxes on speculative activity might encourage banks to focus greater attention on performing their key societal role of providing credit .
over the longer term , most economists agree that governments , especially in advanced industrial countries with aging populations , should be concerned about the sustainability of their policies .
but public reaction to them , together with recent oil price increases , may well account in good measure for the change in market psychology .
attitudes toward risks change over time , and events like ahmadinejad ’s and peres ’s remarks can precipitate such changes .
so , while these things happen in ways that are hard to quantify , maybe analysts should pay attention to the words of ahmadinejad just as carefully as they do to those of bernanke in trying to understand the direction of the world ’s stock markets .
economists might not like to focus on the public mindset and how it interacts with price changes , world news stories , and speculative dynamics .
after all , doing so implies that economic events are less predictable ( and economists less omniscient ) than they like to imagine .
new york – in their efforts to pass a bailout plan for america ’s financial system , bush administration officials invoked the specter of the great depression of the 1930 ’s .
but , for most asians , economic armageddon is far more recent .
the asian financial crisis of a decade ago brought banks , corporations and governments to their knees .
the bonfire was sparked by the collapse of the thai baht in the summer of 1997 .
contagion soon spread across east asia , with the ripple effects of serial currency devaluations reaching as far as russia and brazil .
of course , plato ’s purpose in the dialogue is not to define piety : if socrates knows of a better definition than the unacceptable ones offered by euthyphro , he does not reveal it .
rather , plato ’s point is to show that euthyphro is ignorant of his own ignorance about piety , and that euthyphro thus can not really know that prosecuting his father is in fact the right thing to do .
the knowledge that comes from this kind of self-examination is crucial in all decision-making .
one ought to know the moral character of any action one is contemplating .
and to know that , one must be as well aware of what one does not know as of what one does .
one billion people worldwide do not have access to clean water , and more than two billion lack adequate sanitation .
furthermore , water scarcity means food scarcity .
after all , the agricultural sector accounts for 70 % of global freshwater consumption ; with water in short supply , farmers are less able to feed the world ’s population .
this year , china experienced its worst drought in a half-century , which affected millions of acres of farmland and caused power shortages .
in northern africa , the encroaching desert has displaced many people , and has exacerbated tensions between farmers and herders .
brazil 's deregulation of agriculture and encouragement of r & d enabled the brazilian agriculture research corporation to pioneer more than 9,000 technology projects , including the design of a tropical soybean strain that can thrive in brazil 's climate .
efficiency soared , placing brazil 's crop yields on par with those of developed economies .
the era of “ easy " gdp growth driven by a massive army of young workers is ending .
emerging economies must face the resulting growth challenge head-on , by pursuing sweeping changes in policies , incentives , and established practices to boost productivity .
recognizing this imperative is the first step .
since the g-20 ’s meeting at cannes last november , for example , europe has increased its financial firewalls by € 200 billion ( $ 252 billion ) , restructured greek debt , taken steps towards strengthening its banks and banking regulations , established rules for fiscal discipline , and implemented a range of labor - and product-market reforms .
but the magnitude of the challenges confronting europe implies an urgent need for far more decisive reforms .
we are confident that europe will act together to meet these challenges , and we will continue to support such efforts , because european stability and growth matter for us all .
second , we need a clear message from the g-20 that all of its members are delivering policies for strong , sustainable , and balanced growth .
to be meaningful , the message must be backed up with action : g-20 members must demonstrate that their policies are clearly directed toward restoring economic growth and creating jobs , and that they will be accountable for meeting their commitments in full .
they must work with bureaucracies , which are naturally disinclined to have their efforts prioritized , lest they end up as anything less than number one .
whenever we prioritize , we not only say where we should do more ( which is good ) but also where we should not increase our efforts ( which is regarded as cynical ) .
but not talking about priorities does not make the need to prioritize go away .
instead , the choices only become less clear , less democratic , and less efficient .
refusing to prioritize , dealing mainly with the most publicized problems , is wrong .
the point is not to get lost in endless comparisons or arcane mathematics , but to underscore that it is possible – and , indeed , necessary – to have a meaningful discussion of inequality , based on concrete figures , with the goal of establishing clear targets .
if the right targets are to be selected , the debate must be better informed .
as it stands , surveys show that people tend to believe that inequality is lower than it actually is , but still higher than the level they would consider ideal .
this is true in most countries – including in the us , where inequality is among the highest in the world – though there are a few countries , such as norway , where people have a more realistic view .
correcting these misperceptions will change people ’s opinions of redistributive policies .
those sanctions have crippled iran ’s economy .
similarly , denying any bank that does business with a russian bank or company access to the us financial system would create the kind of economic chaos last seen in russia immediately after the fall of communism .
ordinary russians should be made to understand that permitting putin – whose primary claim to leadership is that he ended the penury of the first post-soviet years – to continue with his imperialist aggression will cost them dearly .
third , obama should emphasize to the chinese their stake in eurasian stability .
putin may regard the soviet union ’s disintegration as a tragedy , but for china it was the greatest geostrategic gift imaginable .
against that background , it is not surprising that pay in the financial sector soared .
the city of london , lower manhattan , and a few other centers became money machines that made investment bankers , hedge-fund managers , and private equity folk immoderately wealthy .
university leaders like me spent much of our time persuading them to recycle a portion of their gains to their old schools .
for the last two years , things have been different .
many financial firms have shrunk their balance sheets dramatically , and of course some have gone out of business altogether .
indeed , the policy has emboldened pro-russian politicians who would love nothing more than to see the americans kicked out of kyrgyzstan .
the horse-trading around the base has been intense .
in a february meeting , the us ambassador to kyrgyzstan asked her chinese counterpart about reports that china had offered to pay kyrgyzstan $ 3 billion if the kyrgyz shut down the american base .
the two diplomats were conversing in russian .
“ visibly flustered , ( the chinese ambassador ) temporarily lost his ability to speak russian and began spluttering in chinese to the silent aide diligently taking notes right behind him , ” according to a confidential us diplomatic cable obtained by the web site wikileaks.org .
but , ultimately , the best way to address them and prevent their resurgence is to make sure that economic opportunities are available to those who are determined to try .
social assistance with no hope of individual improvement is not enough .
it is time that france starts questioning its economic model .
in a recent statement about the burning suburbs , chirac declared : “ we will have to draw all the lessons from this crisis , when the time comes and order has been restored , and with a lot of courage and lucidity . ”
but those lessons imply reforms that are more far-reaching than chirac is ever likely to envisage .
we believe that they are faster than us in acquiring and processing knowledge , because they have grown up with tools and techniques that we lacked at their age .
we entrust them with driving our country to new levels of growth and development , which is why we have now appointed a cabinet minister of their age and created a special council of youth .
we have also learned from hundreds of thousands of dead and millions of refugees in our region that sectarian , ideological , cultural , and religious bigotry only fuel the fires of rage .
we can not and will not allow this in our country .
we need to study , teach , and practice tolerance – and to instill it in our children , both through education and our own example .
we know that extremely low real interest rates produce massive expansion of credit .
in countries with higher price growth than in germany , but with the same borrowing costs , this can not produce anything but overheating , higher inflation , and even lower real interest rates .
to stem this flood of credit-induced demand with fiscal policy alone is impossible , and it is absurd to try .
how do you tighten fiscal policy to make up for more than 100 % of gdp in credit-induced spending power in only three years , as occurred in ireland in 2004-2007 – and in a democracy sporting a fiscal surplus , as ireland is ?
to ask politicians in a democracy with big surpluses to raise taxes or cut benefits or public investment by the enormous magnitude needed to stave off disaster strikes is to be out of touch with reality .
but the bottom line is that constitutional changes can only be carried by unanimous agreement , and several member governments , starting with the uk , would resist any overtly federalist agenda .
in the past , no doubt , france ( under president mitterrand ) and germany ( under chancellor kohl ) would together regularly press the case for closer integration , despite british reluctance .
but today , france and germany are less united on a common european strategy , and their commitment to european integration seems less strong .
as a result , the french government is reluctant to force a confrontation with the british , if there is any chance of a softer compromise in future .
the problem is that this conspiracy of evasion may not work , and the significance of fischer 's speech is that he is the first government minister in office to say so in public , even if he pretends to say it in a personal capacity .
enthusiasts describe it as a new brand of modern industrial policy that can help to push brazil beyond its traditional role as a commodity exporter .
critics call it a misguided effort that will only create more distortions and retard growth .
in my view , the intellectual case for activist policies – as made , for example , by dani rodrik and ricardo hausmann of harvard – is strong .
markets for innovation and new ideas work poorly and governments can help to address those market failures .
but rodrik and hausmann also show that getting such policies right implies exacting requirements .
those among the native population with the lowest incomes and education levels will always be worse off , if they have to compete with a large number of young male immigrants .
to be sure , gender imbalances are not the only driver of anti-immigrant sentiment , let alone populism more broadly .
but evolutionary psychology , which stresses competition for females , can add another dimension to our understanding of these phenomena , while helping us to predict when and where civil strife might erupt .
there is little that can be done to change gender imbalances in a particular place .
but , even if the problem can not be “ solved , ” understanding it might help to limit the damage , not least by enabling leaders to avoid policies that are either not useful or would exacerbate tensions .
new haven – codependency never ends well in personal relationships .
judging by the ever-escalating trade war between the united states and china , the same is true of economic relationships .
while i published a book in 2014 on the codependent economic relationship between the us and china , i would be the first to concede that it is a stretch to generalize insights from human psychology to assess the behavior of national economies .
but the similarities are striking , and the prognosis all the more compelling , as the world ’s two largest economies sink into a dangerous quagmire .
in its most basic terms , codependency occurs at one of the extremes of relationship dynamics – when two partners draw more from each other than from their own inner strength .
but how is this identity to be defined ?
this is the point at which many begin to use language that defines europe by distinction , indeed by contrast , to the us -- europe as the anti-america .
throughout the cold war , what was then the soviet union provided a raison d'être for european union ; in the era of globalization , it is the us .
comparing and contrasting the two sides of the atlantic has a long pedigree , of course .
european culture and american commerce , european profundity and american materialism -- these are ancient and tired themes .
without raising national saving – highly unlikely under the current us budget trajectory – trade will simply be shifted away from china to america ’s other trading partners .
with this trade diversion likely to migrate to higher-cost platforms around the world , american consumers will be hit with the functional equivalent of a tax hike .
ironically , trump has summoned the same robert lighthizer , veteran of the japan trade battles of the 1980s , to lead the charge against china .
unfortunately , lighthizer seems as clueless about the macro argument today as he was back then .
in both episodes , the us was in denial , bordering on delusion .
the government of hollande and prime minister jean-marc ayrault has strong majorities at all executive and legislative levels , giving it a rare opportunity to act .
if it can renew the european model at home , it will be able to project that success much more widely , particularly in southern europe , in turn reinforcing confidence and belief in the eu , particularly among the young generation .
the french center-left must lead in conceiving a vision for europe in which solidarity and equity reinforce long-term economic strength .
finally , along with the united kingdom among european countries , france retains more of a global role than germany has yet acquired .
while the united nations security council is outdated in its structure , it still plays a crucial legitimizing role ; and france , not germany , is a member .
deep reforms – focused on quality and performance , rather than on enrollment and diplomas – are needed to transform the learning process and unleash the productivity growth that a young labor force requires .
the third challenge , instrumental to meeting the first two , will be to strengthen regional arab solidarity .
many outsiders underestimate or purposefully minimize the “ arabness ” of the arab world .
but the revolutions of 2011 demonstrated that a strong sense of identity , a common language , and much shared history bind arabs together , despite huge differences in natural-resource endowments , political circumstances , and average per capita incomes .
how else can one explain that an act of revolt in tunisia led to popular revolts from north africa to the arabian peninsula ?
who has the more flexible job ?
who has a boss or company that better supports reconciling work and family obligations ?
attitudes about male caregiving are beginning to shift in the us .
only a third of millennial men believe in traditional gender roles .
america ’s biggest tech companies are beginning to compete for talent by offering paternity leave .
muted wage growth increases competitiveness , and underutilized labor and capital are redeployed .
how fast this happens partly depends on the private sector ’s flexibility and dynamism .
but it also depends on the ability and willingness of government to provide a bridging function for the deficiency in aggregate demand , and to pursue reforms and investments that boost long-term growth prospects .
if public-sector deleveraging is not a complete growth policy – and it is n’t – why is there so much attention on fiscal austerity and so little action ( as opposed to lip service ) on growth and employment ?
several possibilities – not mutually exclusive – come to mind .
by contrast , when the personal situations of many individual americans are examined through european eyes , the extreme individualism that constitutes a key part of american optimism translates into an unacceptable social scandal .
“ cities of tents are filling with the victims of the economic crisis , ” read one headline a month ago on the front page of a mass-circulation american newspaper .
journalists report tragic stories of middle-class americans losing their jobs and homes , potentially putting their lives at risk without any social protection .
who will pay for your costly cancer treatment if you lose the health insurance policy that came with your job ?
it is wrong to assume , as some ultra-free marketers do , that the absence of social protection makes you stronger .
warsaw : recently poland experienced a typical -- and typically unfinished -- political debate .
it focused on whether a " free " education should be made a constitutional right .
a free , or as its postcommunist advocates prefer to call it , a " not paid for " education , means education in schools and universities owned by the state ( but not in private schools ) .
only by raising the issue to the level of a constitutional right , say the postcommunists , can the guarantee of free and equal access to education be maintained .
due to their dominance in parliament , the intransigence of the postcommunists on this point forced the other political parties participating in drafting poland ’s new constitution to kowtow to their position .
governments must also clarify the responsibilities of national water agencies and improve the capacity of water-related institutions at all levels to institute large-scale unconventional-water programs .
best practices should be clarified , innovations identified and tested , and knowledge and experience shared .
the private sector also has a role to play in the shift toward unconventional water resources – a role that must extend beyond current efforts to tap desalinated water and urban greywater and wastewater .
finally , local institutions , nongovernmental organizations , and local communities must be mobilized – for example , through public campaigns showcasing the benefits of harnessing the potential of unconventional water resources .
sustainable development goal 6 calls for universal access to clean water and sanitation .
as a result , targeting china has enormous political appeal .
so , what can be made of the may 19 deal ?
beyond a ceasefire in tit-for-tat tariffs , there are few real benefits .
us negotiators are fixated on targeted reductions of around $ 200 billion in the bilateral trade imbalance over a two-year time frame .
given the extent of america ’s multilateral problem , this is largely a meaningless objective , especially in light of the massive and ill-timed tax cuts and federal expenditure increases that the us has enacted in the last six months .
the unprecedented economic expansion that has lifted millions out of poverty has been accompanied by widening income disparities , as well as serious environmental damage .
as a result , asia now has two faces : a prosperous and growing middle class , and those who have yet to benefit from the region ’s rapid economic development – and whose health and well-being is being adversely affected by acute problems like air and water pollution .
in short , the key challenges facing asia today are to sustain economic growth – at lower , but still enviable , rates – and to improve its quality .
asia needs strong , inclusive , green , knowledge-led growth , which implies the need to rebalance the sources of economic dynamism to emphasize domestic , regional , and inter-regional “ south-south ” demand .
economic relations with the west would not be diluted by this shift .
berkeley – the central insight of macroeconomics is a fact that was known to john stuart mill in the first third of the nineteenth century : there can be a large gap between supply and demand for pretty much all currently produced goods and services and types of labor if there is an equally large excess demand for financial assets .
and this fundamental fact is a source of big trouble .
a normal gap between supply and demand for some subset of currently produced commodities is not a serious problem , because it is balanced by excess demand for other currently produced commodities .
as industries suffering from insufficient demand shed workers , industries benefiting from surplus demand hire them .
the economy rapidly rebalances itself and thus returns to full employment – and does so with a configuration of employment and production that is better adapted to current consumer preferences .
russian liberals initially welcomed the budanov case as a sign that the country might address accusations that war crimes were committed in chechnya .
last month , however , the military prosecutor accepted colonel budanov 's argument that he was temporarily insane when he killed the girl , and so acquitted budanov on the charge of murder .
( the rape charge , for some unclear reason , had already been dropped . )
the prosecution then began to speak of the young girl as a chechen sniper , from a family of snipers .
outraged , defense minister sergei ivanov dismissed the prosecutor , who seemed ready to acquit the patriotic " hero " on all remaining charges .
once the team is in place , its members will need to figure out how to make trump ’s plans work for an economy that has – by necessity , not choice – been excessively reliant on unconventional monetary policies .
the plan must recognize that , during this protracted period of monetary expansion , both financial markets and resource-allocation have been distorted , worsening wealth inequality .
the good news is that the incoming administration can draw on measures that were formulated during obama ’s tenure , but which gained little traction because of the highly polarized and dysfunctional congressional politics that characterized most of obama ’s eight years in office .
such measures address imperatives such as infrastructure investment , tax reform , and job creation .
but , of course , the us does not exist in a vacuum .
washington , dc – just over a hundred years ago , the united states led the world in terms of rethinking how big business worked – and when the power of such firms should be constrained .
in retrospect , the breakthrough legislation – not just for the us , but also internationally – was the sherman antitrust act of 1890 .
the dodd-frank financial reform bill , which is about to pass the us senate , does something similar – and long overdue – for banking .
prior to 1890 , big business was widely regarded as more efficient and generally more modern than small business .
most people saw the consolidation of smaller firms into fewer , large firms as a stabilizing development that rewarded success and allowed for further productive investment .
tokyo – when was the last time you sat down and wrote a letter ?
i do n’t mean an email or a text message ; nor would i count a dictated message to a machine or a personal assistant .
no , i mean an old-fashioned “ dear donald ” or “ dear hillary ” letter .
the reason i ask is that 65,000 people actually did write such letters to barack obama every week when he was serving as president of the united states .
according to a recent feature in the guardian , a team of white house staffers would select ten letters each day to pass along to the president , who would then respond to them personally that evening .
they might tell pollsters they were prepared to pay higher taxes for better public services and a more compassionate attitude to the poor .
but in the end they would do exactly what they had done in each of the previous four elections - vote for a party which proclaimed " every man for himself " .
today this pseudo-marxist theory for economic determinism has been refuted once and for all .
in 1992 , john major ran for re-election in the midst of an economic slump , a vicious monetary squeeze and the aftermath of a rapid inflation .
economic determinists predicted that he did not stand a chance .
transactional leadership is more effective in stable and predictable environments , whereas an inspirational style is more likely to appear in periods of rapid and discontinuous social and political change .
the transformational objectives and inspirational style of a leader like mahatma gandhi in india or nelson mandela in south africa can significantly influence outcomes in fluid political contexts , particularly in developing countries with weakly structured institutional constraints .
by contrast , american foreign-policy formation is highly constrained by institutions like congress , the courts , and the constitution .
thus , we would expect less opportunity for transformational leadership .
but even the us constitution is ambiguous about the powers of congress and the president in foreign policy .
berlin – it ’s been 30 years since the food and agriculture organization of the united nations launched the tropical forestry action plan , the first global intergovernmental initiative to halt forest loss .
since then , deforestation has continued unabated , and the latest international effort to stop it – an initiative known as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( redd + ) – looks no more likely to be effective .
far from protecting the world ’s forests , the most notable outcome of these two agreements has been , ironically , the production of reams of expensive consultancy reports .
redd + was created as part of the un framework convention on climate change , and the agreement governing its implementation is expected to be finalized during the un conference on climate change in paris .
but if world leaders are serious about halting forest loss , they should instead abandon redd + and replace it with a mechanism that addresses the underlying drivers of large-scale deforestation .
donald payne , a leading member of the us house foreign affairs committee , and ana gomes , a member of the european parliament from portugal and head of the eu ’s observation team in the 2005 elections , have sought to tie non-humanitarian aid more closely to ethiopia ’s conduct on press freedom and other human rights .
britain and some other european governments responded to the post-election crackdown by temporarily withholding aid .
but ethiopia poses a dilemma for anyone who cares about human rights and democracy .
cutting off aid could have calamitous humanitarian consequences for the nation ’s 80 million people .
it could also destabilize a fragile region , sparking fresh wars with neighboring somalia and eritrea .
to keep people working longer , it is crucial to keep them healthy .
that is why the health-care industry must play a significant role in efforts to address the challenges of population aging .
old age must be viewed not simply as an inevitable stage of life , but as an opportunity for health-care companies and systems to help people thrive .
to this end , health-care companies should shift the focus of their research-and-development efforts toward conditions that are prevalent among older patients , including chronic diseases like diabetes , heart disease , glaucoma , rheumatoid arthritis , and cancer .
such efforts are also vital to find ways to stem more effectively the deterioration of people ’s productivity and independence , by preserving their physical strength , mental acuity , and senses like hearing and vision .
the second big transition-financing opportunity is in blended finance , or collaborative schemes that raise private capital for public goods .
these initiatives bring together a wide range of public and private stakeholders , including multilateral organizations , to finance projects with deep environmental and social impacts .
moreover , the blended approach helps to scale up and de-risk projects and optimize their funding .
the tropical landscapes financing facility , developed in indonesia in cooperation with the un environment programme , is a good example .
the initiative combines private , public , and philanthropic funds to maximize environmental and social benefits .
emerging markets were initially tied to this distress only when foreign investors began pulling out their money .
then panic spread to credit markets , money markets , and currency markets , highlighting the vulnerabilities of many developing countries ’ financial systems and corporate sectors , which had experienced credit booms and had borrowed short and in foreign currencies .
countries with large current-account deficits and/or large fiscal deficits and with large short-term foreign currency liabilities have been the most fragile .
but even the better-performing ones – like brazil , russia , india , and china – are now at risk of a hard landing .
many emerging markets are now at risk of a severe financial crisis .
and if there were a new referendum , british voters would probably have to decide between an orderly brexit and remaining in the eu , because nobody will dare to offer a hard brexit as an alternative .
until recently , a reversal of british voters ’ 2016 decision to leave the eu had seemed unlikely .
but the interventions by bercow and the eu have opened up a whole new game , dramatically increasing the chance that brexit may not happen .
this would foil financial-market speculators who were betting on a withdrawal , and is good news for both the uk and the eu .
nearly three years ago , british voters did not really know what they were doing when they decided by a narrow majority to leave the eu .
beijing – forty years ago this month , china ’s leaders set the country on a path of reform that has produced the most dramatic economic transformation in history .
mao zedong had died two years earlier , in 1976 , and the newly rehabilitated deng xiaoping succeeded in stamping his vision of economic development and modernization on the third plenary session of the eleventh central committee held in december 1978 .
in the four decades since , china has transformed itself into an economic powerhouse , portending an equally momentous makeover of the global economy and geopolitics .
china ’s reforms started in agriculture , where the crushing burden of state controls was relaxed .
through the dual-track pricing mechanism , farmers were given market incentives .
jerusalem – as a result of misguided american policy , the threat of another military confrontation hangs like a dark cloud over the middle east .
the united states ’ enemies have been strengthened , and iran – despite being branded as a member of the so-called “ axis of evil ” – has been catapulted into regional hegemony .
iran could never have achieved this on its own , certainly not in such a short time .
a hitherto latent rivalry between iran and israel thus has been transformed into an open struggle for dominance in the middle east .
the result has been the emergence of some surprising , if not bizarre , alliances : iran , syria , hezbollah , hamas , and the american-backed , shia-dominated iraq are facing israel , saudi arabia , and most of the other sunni arab states , all of which feel existentially threatened by iran ’s ascendance .
fascination with liberal freedom came in poland and elsewhere at a peculiar moment .
old social structures were destroyed , socialist customs and habits vanished overnight , former norms and unwritten rules were abandoned .
in the postcommunist social revolution ( less often noticed than the political and economic upheavals ) families and communities were undermined and ( at least in poland ) the church was too involved in politics to help .
people were left to withstand the gales of change alone .
to be free but alone is not easy , particularly when habits of dependence are ingrained .
the crisis must also not become an excuse to create new institutional formats that jeopardize the delicate balance between the different eu institutions , a balance that – through appropriate adjustments – has been proven by the test of time .
of course , the crisis does highlight the need to strengthen the eu ’s institutions and instruments for common action and coordination .
we need final and complete ratification of the lisbon treaty in order to have the institutionally and internationally stronger european union we need .
nor should today ’s uncertainties become an excuse to call into question the need to continue and complete the process of eu enlargement .
extending the eu ’s area of freedom and democracy , peace , stability , and prosperity , especially throughout south-eastern europe , is in the interest of every european citizen .
a commonly cited example of the outgoing government ’s alleged economic mismanagement was its sugar-price policy .
powerful sugarcane cooperatives , led by major upa supporters , supposedly drove the government to fix extravagant prices and write off sugar farmers ’ bad debts , leading to over-production .
instead of eliminating this system , as expected , modi ’s government has augmented subsidies for sugar exports to support higher output , raised import duties on sugar to discourage foreign competition , and increased the percentage of sugar-based ethanol that must be blended with petrol .
his motivation is not difficult to discern : his bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) hopes that such concessions will help it to wrest control of maharashtra , india ’s main sugar-producing state , from the upa in the upcoming state assembly election .
this goal explains another policy reversal as well .
berlin – the german social democrats ’ ( spd ) existential crisis can no longer be treated as a typical party crisis .
the party captured a mere 9.7 % of the vote in regional elections in bavaria this month , and it is trailing both the populist alternative für deutschland ( afd ) and the greens in national opinion polls .
with another important regional election fast approaching in hesse , polls indicate that the spd will lose still more support , albeit not as dramatically as in bavaria .
the spd and the christian democratic union/christian social union ( cdu/csu ) have stood as the twin pillars of german politics since the end of world war ii .
but with the spd declining , germany is moving from a de facto two-party system to a multiparty system in which no single party plays a dominant role .
while russia itself will not freeze accounts , president putin 's meaning was clear : it would be better for all sides if this money were brought home and invested in the national economy .
to achieve this end , russia must create a secure and attractive investment climate .
most importantly , if we are to reverse capital flight , the government must persuade individual savers that they can deposit money safely and withdraw it on demand .
how can the government expect to mobilize domestic investment as long as ordinary russians keep their savings -- $ 50 billion , according to most estimates -- at home ?
russia 's people need to be convinced of the country 's political stability -- that , for example , nobody will suggest nationalization , as happened repeatedly during the eight months that i was prime minister .
without gorbachev and his singular courage , the stream of events across europe during fall of 1989 never would have been possible .
for with gorbachev 's ascendance , more and more people in east germany took heart and stopped being afraid of their repressive regime .
they realized that the realities of east germany were not fixed in stone after all ; that it was possible to achieve change , which many brave dissidents and proponents of civil rights trapped behind the wall had demanded for so long a time .
their commitment against the injustice of the communist regime is for me one of the best chapters in german history .
the opening of hungary 's borders that autumn and the seeking of refuge by east german citizens in the german embassies of prague and warsaw already had shaken communist and stasi rule to its their foundations .
as a result , some – though , relatively speaking , not many – undertake long and often perilous journeys to developed countries .
and yet , when they arrive at the rich world ’s doorstep , the welcome they receive is increasingly mixed , as manufactured panic over supposedly massive influxes of “ dangerous ” outsiders closes the space for humane , pragmatic responses .
responsibility-sharing – the foundation of the modern international system for protecting refugees – is replaced by responsibility-shifting , usually onto countries that are least able to cope .
it is time to reboot global efforts to protect refugees .
what is needed is a comprehensive strategy with global reach , reflecting a sweeping vision that inspires and engages governments , the aid community , businesses , development institutions , civil society , faith groups , academia , sports , and the arts .
munich – the euro crisis has passed through six phases so far .
it is worth recalling them , because they show how policymakers stumbled along , trying to put out fires without keeping an eye on where their chosen path was leading them .
currently , markets remain calm , but this is only the beginning of a seventh phase of the crisis , during which europe will become mired in debt .
the sequence so far has been as follows :
the seventh phase of the crisis is one of enhanced moral hazard , stemming from a run-up in debt .
between 1985 and 2005 , boomsters made 10-year forecasts that exaggerated the chances of big positive changes in both financial markets ( e.g. , a dow jones industrial average of 36,000 ) and world politics ( e.g. , tranquility in the middle east and dynamic growth in sub-saharan africa ) .
they assigned probabilities of 65 % to rosy scenarios that materialized only 15 % of the time .
in the same period , doomsters performed even more poorly , exaggerating the chances of negative changes in all the same places where boomsters accentuated the positive , plus several more ( i still await the impending disintegration of canada , nigeria , india , indonesia , south africa , belgium , and sudan ) .
they assigned probabilities of 70 % to bleak scenarios that materialized only 12 % of the time .
second , again as the skeptics warned , over-claimers rarely pay penalties for being wrong .
the economic challenges of brexit would be overwhelming .
the out campaign ’s main economic argument – that britain ’s huge trade deficit is a secret weapon , because the eu would have more to lose than britain from a breakdown in trade relations – is flatly wrong .
britain would need to negotiate access to the european single market for its service industries , whereas eu manufacturers would automatically enjoy virtually unlimited rights to sell whatever they wanted in britain under global world trade organization rules .
margaret thatcher was the first to realize that britain ’s specialization in services – not only finance , but also law , accountancy , media , architecture , pharmaceutical research and so on – makes membership in the eu single market critical .
it makes little economic difference to germany , france , or italy whether britain is an eu member or simply in the wto .
answering them will require a debate that transcends issues like the separation of powers and judicial independence and elucidates the appropriate relationship between politics and religion .
for that , understanding the historical context of the current crisis is crucial .
when turkey became a democracy in 1950 , the previous system ’s secular kemalist elites attempted to harness the power of the military and the bureaucracy to control the elected government .
in fact , the turkish military , with the judiciary ’s support , explicitly intervened in the civilian government ’s functioning in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 , and 1997 , each time in the name of protecting secularism .
in response , various religious groups , including the gülen movement , encouraged their followers to take positions in the bureaucracy and the military .
berlin – during the long night of negotiations over greece on july 12-13 , something fundamental to the european union cracked .
since then , europeans have been living in a different kind of eu .
what changed that night was the germany that europeans have known since the end of world war ii .
on the surface , the negotiations were about averting a greek exit from the eurozone ( or “ grexit ” ) and the dire consequences that would follow for greece and the monetary union .
at a deeper level , however , what was at stake was the role in europe of its most populous and economically most powerful country .
but the rise of arab military coalitions raises serious concerns , not least because the history of arab-led military interventions – unlike those carried out by the west in places like bosnia , kosovo , and even libya – does not contain any promising precedent .
such interventions were usually aimed at empowering a proxy political force over its military and political rivals , instead of averting humanitarian disaster or institutionalizing a non-violent conflict-resolution mechanism following a war .
egypt ’s military intervention in yemen in the 1960s is a case in point .
by late 1965 , egyptian president gamel abdel nasser had sent 70,000 troops in yemen to support a republican coup against royalist forces .
despite using prohibited chemical weapons against yemeni guerillas from 1963 to 1967 – a first in an intra-arab conflict – egypt failed to achieve its objectives .
the reform process was led by oecd countries and opened up to developing countries only after this initial package was unveiled .
today , 125 countries are involved , forming a group called the “ inclusive framework . ”
beps was undoubtedly an important step toward tackling some of the most egregious tax-avoidance strategies used by multinationals .
it initiated , for example , the sharing among tax authorities of country-by-country reports on these companies ’ profits and tax payments .
unfortunately , however , this norm will apply only to very large multinationals , and the reports will not be publicly available , depriving civil society of an essential tool of transparency .
and even eliminating accelerated depreciation would not broaden the tax base enough to finance a rate cut to 28 % .
likewise , while limiting the deductibility of net interest for corporations , as many other developed countries have done , would broaden the tax base and discourage excessive reliance on debt financing , it would increase the tax burden on major investments in physical capital , which are often debt-financed .
reducing the tax preferences for non-corporate business entities ( such as partnerships ) that pass their income through to their owners ’ individual returns would also broaden the tax base subject to the corporate-income tax .
pass-through companies now account for more than 80 % of net business income ( by far the highest share in the developed countries ) .
several of these entities are very large and profitable , and enjoy the same legal benefits as corporations .
israel 's disengagement plan presents the evacuation of gaza settlements as an end to 37 years of occupation .
but at the same time , israel insists that gaza will not have any attributes of sovereignty and will continue to be governed by existing arrangements covering most aspects of security and civil administration .
this means that the israeli military will continue to enter gaza at will and maintain control over border crossings , airspace , and territorial waters .
nor will the israeli military be withdrawn from the strip of land along the palestinian-egyptian border .
these conditions rule out any possibility of forging a security plan that would receive the support of all factions , including hamas .
almost 60 years later , agricultural employment in the us peaked at 53 % of total employment .
today , it is less than 3 % .
in fact , since as recently as 1980 , most countries have experienced large declines in agricultural employment .
in some , like portugal , malaysia , turkey , and indonesia , the share of agricultural employment declined by more than 20 % .
in others , like greece , italy , bulgaria , hungary , estonia , poland , philippines , and sri lanka , the decline exceeded 10 % .
islamabad -- as pakistan gears up for its parliamentary election on february 18 , many observers hope that the vote will usher in a period of stability and calm by lending popular legitimacy to the government .
but sometimes democracy is best served by refusing to participate .
the upcoming election , to be held under the illegal provisional constitutional order ( pco ) implemented following president pervez musharraf ’s state of emergency on november 3 , is such a case , which is why my party and its coalition partners are boycotting the vote .
to be sure , contesting the election would provide my party with a great opportunity to take issues to the people .
in fact , my party ’s support has been growing , with opinion polls now indicating that it is the second most popular in the frontier province – and gaining ground in every other province .
and it is a good thing that the official sector is paying more attention to joblessness – a very good thing .
yet , unfortunately , this shift will not solve a problem that eats away at the social fabric of any society .
as much as bernanke and others wish otherwise – and as much as bickering politicians seek to dump policy responsibilities on others – central banks do not have the proper tools to deal with the component of the unemployment crisis that results from insufficient investment in education , training , and physical capital .
likewise , they can not fix debt overhangs , repair broken home financing , or address medium-term fiscal-reform challenges on their own .
the best that central banks can do is to buy time , albeit at an increasing cost , for other policymaking entities to get their act together .
in fact , china ’s dam builders are targeting most of the international rivers that flow out of chinese territory .
most of china ’s internationally shared water resources are located on the tibetan plateau , which it annexed in the early 1950s .
unsurprisingly , the plateau is the new hub of chinese dam building .
indeed , china ’s 13th five-year plan , released this year , calls for a new wave of dam projects on the plateau .
moreover , china recently cut off the flow of a tributary of the brahmaputra river , the lifeline of bangladesh and northern india , to build a dam as part of a major hydroelectric project in tibet .
washington , dc – ten years after the failure of lehman brothers , we know that multilateral action was crucial in preventing the so-called great recession from becoming even worse than it was .
back then , it was the global financial system that was tottering .
today , it is the global trade system that is in jeopardy .
over the past 70 years , multilateralism has served the world well .
much to its credit , the united states eschewed retribution and reparations after world war ii .
schools were multiplying as attendance surged .
other public services were improving as well , and parents believed that their children would lead more prosperous lives than they and previous generations had .
this was certainly true of my parents , who sacrificed a lot to raise their nine children .
they were not happy when , in the 1970s , their older sons became communists , strongly opposing the brutal regime of hafez al-assad , president bashar al-assad ’s father .
but this was not a farfetched transformation in a city where people were assuming new identities – such as nasserist , baathist , islamist , or communist – downplaying their regional and tribal origins .
this results in high turnover owing to overwork , and an increased need for foreign health-care workers to fill sorely needed positions .
gcc policymakers have been right to focus on increasing access and subsidies for quality health care .
but the fair distribution of health-care services across native and migrant populations is often a thorny policy issue .
and now policymakers must also devote more attention to the health-care workforce itself , to ensure that it is properly educated and trained for the challenges that await the region .
training programs in gcc national health systems today do not focus nearly enough on innovation or systems thinking to improve efficiency and effectiveness .
if the army collapses , it is algeria [ and ] france which collapses . ”
the decisive moment came when de gaulle , in military uniform , went on television to demonstrate his mastery of the new medium .
“ well , my dear and old country , here we are again facing a heavy test , ” he said .
insisting that self-determination was the only way ahead , he called on the army to reject even passive association with the insurrection and instructed it to re-establish public order .
if the state bowed before the challenge it faced , “ france would be no more than a poor , broken toy floating on an ocean of uncertainty , ” he warned .
just when the world reached a consensus that ahmadinejad was merely an instrument of the supreme leader , ayatollah khamenei , ahmadinejad appointed a vice-president against khamenei ’s wishes ( though he later retracted the appointment ) .
what we do know with certainty is that the regime is divided .
these divisions will allow new forces to emerge in iranian society .
so all means should be found to reach out to iranian society at all levels .
iranian students should be encouraged to visit and study in asian universities , where they would discover how confident young chinese and indian students are about the future − which might well cause them to reflect on why young iranians do not share that optimism .
how can you evaluate a contribution of light infantry against the provision of critical enablers such as helicopters or air-to-air refueling tankers ?
over what time period do you make your calculations ?
common funding , with all members paying a share according to their gdp , is one instrument that can be used to achieve more equitable burden-sharing .
traditionally , nato applied a policy of “ costs lie where they fall ” : each member picked up all the costs for the operational contribution that it made to an alliance operation .
during the past couple of years , nato ’s funding policy has been updated to allow common funding to be used as an incentive for the provision of certain theater-level enabling capabilities , like medical facilities , airports handling troops and supplies , or intelligence .
moreover , one could argue that easy money itself has contributed to the unexpectedly strong disinflationary forces seen in recent years .
owing to easy financing and regulatory forbearance , aggregate supply has risen as “ zombie ” companies have proliferated .
meanwhile , aggregate demand has been restrained by the debt headwinds – yet another result of easy monetary conditions .
in view of these conditions , continuing to insist on monetary easing seems particularly ill advised .
with so many potential dangers on the horizon , central bankers should at least consider rethinking the fundamental assumptions underlying their policies .
so , among a bad set of options , the least bad appears to be cooperation with the us .
yet cooperation with the us may not gain the al-sauds much , because saudi relations with america are strained to the breaking point .
ever since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington last year , the regime — once central to american strategic interests in the region , has been made to feel dispensable by the us , which drops strong hints that there are alternatives to saudi military bases , even to saudi oil .
although the saudis were not included in president bush ’s “ axis of evil , ” some american policymakers now view the country as a “ kernel of evil . ”
al-qaeda ’s terrorist network is seen as arising directly from fundamentalist wahhabi teachings , which constitute an integral part of the saudi regime .
how victims remember trauma is the most controversial issue facing psychology and psychiatry today .
many clinical trauma theorists believe that combat , rape , and other terrifying experiences are seemingly engraved on the mind , never to be forgotten .
others disagree , arguing that the mind can protect itself by banishing memories of trauma from awareness , making it difficult for victims to remember their most horrific experiences until it is safe to do so many years later .
while acknowledging that trauma is often all too memorable , these certain clinical trauma theorists assert that a condition known as “ traumatic dissociative amnesia ” leaves a large minority of victims unable to recall their trauma , precisely because it was so overwhelmingly terrifying .
however , these clinical trauma theorists do not argue that “ repressed ” or “ dissociated ” memories of horrific events are either inert or benign .
in calcutta , when some younger kid came along and insisted on joining the game my friends were playing , we would let the new kid in , but only after whispering into each other 's ears the words , elé belé .
an elé belé is a player who thinks he is participating but , in truth , is merely going through the motions .
everybody knew that a goal scored by him was not a real goal .
as a child , mastering the cruel art of elé belé was important .
when a new kid arrived , accompanied by a doting mother , we could convey to one another with a mere glance that the kid would be an elé belé .
the financial times stock exchange all-world index rose by nearly 22 % in 2017 – its best performance since the post-crisis rebound of 2009 .
as the growth pessimism of recent years fades , some of the warnings that have been made in recent years seem to have become outdated .
northwestern university ’s robert gordon , for example , argued that the us economy was bound to slow down , because today ’s technological innovations would not boost growth to the extent they had in the past .
harvard ’s lawrence h. summers got a lot of attention for his argument that the world risked sliding toward “ secular stagnation , ” because the interest rate needed to bring desired investment in line with desired savings was below zero .
yet , while the zero lower bound no longer seems to be a binding constraint , there are potential causes for concern , one of which relates to debt levels .
in fact , china has been damming most international rivers flowing out of tibet , whose fragile ecosystem is already threatened by global warming .
the only rivers on which no hydro-engineering works have been undertaken so far are the indus , whose basin falls mostly in india and pakistan , and the salween , which flows into burma and thailand .
local authorities in yunnan province , however , are considering damming the salween in the quake-prone upstream region .
india ’s government has been pressing china for transparency , greater hydrological data-sharing , and a commitment not to redirect the natural flow of any river or diminish cross-border water flows .
but even a joint expert-level mechanism – set up in 2007 merely for “ interaction and cooperation ” on hydrological data – has proven of little value .
perhaps , but most students of monetary policy view quantitative easing as the textbook policy for pulling an economy out of a zero-interest-rate “ liquidity trap , ” thereby preventing the onset of a sustained deflation , which would exacerbate debt burdens .
as for china ’s renminbi , it is still supported by a highly political exchange-rate regime .
eventually , china ’s rapid growth will have to be reflected in a significant rise in its currency , its domestic price level , or in both .
but , in 2011 , most of the equilibration will likely take place through inflation .
finally , currency chaos is the safest bet of all , with sharp and unpredictable swings in floating exchange rates around the world .
without such cooperation , china ’s ambitions would be constrained only by domestic factors , such as a faltering economy , rising social discontent , a worsening environmental crisis , or vicious politics .
which countries should take the lead in constraining china ’s revisionist ambitions ?
with the us distracted by other strategic challenges – not to mention its domestic presidential campaign – asia ’s other powers – in particular , an economically surging india and a more politically assertive japan – are the best candidates for the job .
both india and japan are longstanding stakeholders in the us-led global order , emphasizing in their own international relations the values that america espouses , such as the need to maintain a stable balance of power , respect the territorial and maritime status quo , and preserve freedom of navigation .
moreover , they have demonstrated their shared desire to uphold the existing asian order .
developed countries should also fulfill their obligations under the convention to provide financial support and technology transfer to enable developing countries to effectively tackle climate change .
in addition , appropriate mechanisms and institutional arrangements should be established for adaptation , financial support and technology transfer .
developing countries will , in the context of sustainable development and with measurable , reportable , and verifiable support in terms of financing , technology , and capacity-building , take nationally appropriate mitigation actions .
the global financial crisis has undoubtedly exacerbated the challenge of climate change .
but since climate change is a more far-reaching and serious challenge , the world must not waver in its determination and commitment to addressing it .
florence – earlier this month , jim yong kim abruptly resigned from his post as world bank president , leaving a pillar of the international financial order without leadership or direction .
kim will join a private equity firm , where he believes he can “ make the largest impact on major global issues like climate change . ”
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
the helicopter-money version would be the purchase of zero-interest-rate government bonds that will not be repaid , either because they are perpetual bonds or because they are rolled over every time they mature .
that is arguably what the bank of japan is now doing .
boj governor haruhiko kuroda has said that directly underwriting the budget deficit is not an option .
nonetheless , he has initiated a policy of replacing the government bonds on the boj ’s balance sheet once they mature , while constantly increasing the volume of government debt on the central bank ’s books .
this comes after years of declarations by prominent economists , including berkeley ’s brad delong and former us federal reserve chair ben bernanke , that helicopter money offers a way to overcome deflation ( with which japan has struggled for decades ) .
starting in the summer of 2015 , he embraced extremist rhetoric appealing to nativism , islamophobia , and anger at gop elites .
media outlets provided as much as $ 2 billion worth of free coverage , helping him grab and hold leads in polls and most primaries .
trump ’s core supporters are wrongly thought to be displaced and economically insecure blue-collar workers .
in fact , his voters ’ average annual income , about $ 72,000 , is well above the us median of $ 56,000 .
his supporters resemble the tea partiers : overwhelmingly older , male , middle class , and white .
once a group of people is viewed as disgusting , attention shifts away from them as moral individuals .
they become soulless bodies , and the moral circle closes in to exclude them .
our reaction to soulless bodies is well illustrated in a story told about descartes after he died .
it was known that descartes had an illegitimate daughter , francine , who died when she was five years old .
according to the story , descartes was so struck with grief that he created an automaton , a mechanical doll , built to appear identical to his dead daughter .
but the terrorist attacks in istanbul are unlikely to generate a nervous reaction in restricting democratic rights .
if al-qaeda was behind the attacks , it grossly miscalculated .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's reaction summed up the turkish sentiment : " these bombs aim to destroy the peace and stability in our country .
we will not change our course .
if these bombings are meant to send a message , i will sweep it off and crush it under my feet . "
nonetheless , khamenei ’s invocation of the law echoes the demands of many conservative-pragmatists who lean toward mousavi , who is not in a position to challenge khamenei ’s authority directly .
mousavi must carefully continue his legal campaign , without compromising the trust he has gained from the majority of iranians .
he must stand by his two principal demands : nullification of the election and establishment of an impartial committee to rule on the government ’s violations of the electoral law .
should mousavi persuade khamenei to reconsider his position , the supreme leader ’s hold on power will be shaken .
if khamenei holds fast , mousavi can not gain the presidency , but he will continue to represent the hopes of the majority of iranians who differ dramatically with their government .
there is also something even more important than one ’s reputation .
a political leader has greater opportunities than almost anyone else to help people , and that should have been yanukovych ’s highest priority .
but even if yanukovych was thinking primarily of his own interests , his quest for personal enrichment was irrational .
imagine that he had stopped to ask himself what would make him happier .
imagine that , with this question in mind , he had compared the alternative of a lavish lifestyle ( with a private zoo and pirate-ship restaurant ) with that of living comfortably on the substantial salary to which he was entitled while knowing that he was governing with integrity and doing his best to improve the lives of ukraine ’s citizens .
north korea has been far less forthcoming about its intentions .
it remains to be seen whether it seeks to engage the rest of the world in a constructive and sustained manner , or whether dprk officials and diplomats are merely putting a good face forward to divert international attention from their country ’s reputation as a nuclear weapons-monger and human-rights violator .
indeed , the visit to incheon comes within a context of mixed messages .
two days before the north korean delegation arrived , the committee for the peaceful reunification of korea ( cprk ) , which is officially part of the korean workers party , denounced the “ south korean puppet forces for seriously violating the north-south joint declarations and pushing north-south ties into the worst catastrophe . ”
on the day of the incheon visit , north korea ’s state news agency continued the bellicose and derogatory language toward south korea and the us : “ lurking behind this is an ulterior design of the us to [ prod more ] zealously the south korean puppet forces into escalating the confrontation with the dprk in a bid to strain the situation to an extreme pitch and ignite [ a ] second korean war . ”
when an idea is both intuitively true and actually false , it is often because it is true on one level but not on the level at which it is being applied .
yes , people do specialize , and they should specialize , too .
everyone benefits from each of us becoming good at different things and exchanging our knowhow with others .
it is not efficient for a dentist and a lawyer , for example , to be the same person .
but specialization at the individual level actually leads to diversification at a higher level .
gene-drive organisms are intended to spread indefinitely , and mosquitoes , especially females , can surf air currents at relatively high altitudes ( 40-290 meters , or 131-951 feet ) , where winds can blow them hundreds of miles .
this means that consent would have to be secured significantly beyond the release point.subscribe nowh4 { text-align : center ; } for a limited time only , get unlimited access toon point , the big picture , and the ps archive , plus our annual magazine , for just $ 75 . subscribeyet , in the village of nasso , near bana , authorities told us that , despite meeting with target malaria , they still had questions and concerns about the potential adverse effects of the mosquito release .
civil-society groups operating in and around the test-site villages have also not been adequately consulted about target malaria ’s work.the more interviews i conducted , the clearer it became that local people had not been involved in a genuinely participatory debate on the target malaria project , let alone extended their informed consent .
on the contrary , several people i interviewed called for the experimental release of genetically modified mosquitoes to be halted until the risks and effects had been adequately investigated , and civil society across burkina faso had been fully informed.target malaria ’s lack of commitment to consent is reflected in its own rhetoric , which eschews the unequivocal word “ consent , ” but regularly uses terms like “ engagement ” and “ community acceptance . ”
this choice may indicate that the organization ’s leaders have already decided to proceed with the release.reinforcing this conclusion , after the un convention , target malaria attempted to draw a distinction between the requirement of free , prior , and informed consent in the context of medical research on individuals ( where it is demanded ) and in a public-health context .
many more have simply become discouraged and dropped out of the labor force entirely : not at school , not at work , and not looking for work .
they do n’t protest much , but many end up in prison .
the world ’s labor markets are now interconnected .
young people in countries as diverse as egypt and the us are in effect competing with young chinese and indians for jobs .
china ’s low-paid , reasonably productive manufacturing workers and high-quality infrastructure ( roads , power , ports , and communications ) has set the standard for competitiveness globally .
article 7 of the treaty of lisbon provides for the suspension of a rogue eu member state ’s voting rights .
but , because this “ nuclear option ” requires a unanimous vote by all eu member states , everyone knows that it will never be used .
in fact , article 7 is such an ineffective deterrent that it serves rule-breakers ’ interests , by all but guaranteeing that they will not be punished .
orbán has been scamming the eu for years and encouraging other populists to pursue their own authoritarian goals – and with eu funds to boot .
but the weakening of the rule of law is not just a domestic matter in hungary or poland .
in iraq , bush again pursued a unilateralist agenda , saying that there was incontrovertible evidence of a link with al queda , and that saddam had weapons of mass destruction .
even before the invasion , there was overwhelming evidence that bush was lying .
detection technology made it clear that iraq did not have nuclear weapons , as chief un inspector hans blix pointed out .
it 's possible that bush read those reports , but that they were beyond his comprehension .
it is also possible that he did not believe what he read .
all of these groups are driven by a nihilistic rage born of hostility toward non-sunnis and a rejection of modernity .
unfortunately , as the sri lanka bombings and other attacks in asia show , the defeat of isis in syria and iraq has only intensified the terrorism challenge , because battle-hardened fighters with the operational training to stage savage attacks are now returning home .
the presence of such returnees in sri lanka explains how an obscure local group was able to carry out sophisticated , near-simultaneous strikes on three churches and three hotels , using military-grade explosives .
returnees are present in many other asian countries as well , from the philippines and indonesia to the maldives and uzbekistan .
like osama bin laden and other al-qaeda leaders who cut their teeth in the us-backed war against the soviet occupation of afghanistan , this new generation of jihadist veterans could haunt the security of asia , the middle east , and the west for years to come .
denver – angelina jolie ’s new film , “ in the land of blood and honey , ” is about the ethnic tensions that produced the bloodiest conflict in europe since world war ii .
the film has already won two awards and is an emerging box-office success , attesting to the enduring interest – and perhaps mystery – that the balkans hold for international audiences who were as horrified as they were confused by the events of the 1990 ’s .
for those of us who lived and worked in the region during that turbulent decade , the post-yugoslav wars remain fresh wounds .
as jolie ’s film so ably shows , neither the international community nor local leaders made a concerted effort to prevent bloodshed .
one exception – perhaps the only exception – was kiro gligorov , the president of macedonia , who died in his sleep on new year ’s day , at the age of 94 .
there is evidence of falling foreign investment and this is contributing to the economy ’s disappointing level of investment overall .
moreover , this trend is accentuating the challenges associated with weak productivity growth .
there are also signs that companies with uk-based operations have begun to trigger their brexit contingency plans after a prolonged period of waiting , planning , and more waiting .
in addition to shifting investments out of the uk , firms will also start to relocate jobs .
and this process will likely accelerate even if british prime minister theresa may manages to get her proposed exit deal through parliament .
he advocates local decision-making whenever possible and effective , but also supports national and european-level decision-making where this is appropriate ; the key is that processes should be flexible and enable citizen participation .
he recognizes that shared sovereignty will make europe more influential , thereby empowering its citizens .
and he views globalization as a good thing , but understands that it must be managed through durable , efficient international agreements and institutions .
the opinion polls are currently bouncing wildly , owing to the fillon scandal and a surge in support for hamon among left-wing voters outside of the socialist party .
but if macron qualifies for the second round , he will pose a greater threat to le pen than an outright left-wing candidate would .
the european project is a realist 's response to globalization and its challenges .
it was initiated to create " solidarités de fait , " promote political stability , and consolidate democracy and europe 's social model .
having achieved these goals , europe now wants to make a positive contribution to world developments .
this is not nostalgia for past glory .
an unprecedented degree of solidarity now exists across europe , as was apparent in the collective mourning and outpouring of sympathy towards spain ; we must build on that huge potential to create a logic of solidarity in the world .
for starters , there is his answer to queen elizabeth ii ’s now-famous question : “ why did no one see it coming ? ”
krugman ’s cheerful response is that the new keynesians were looking the other way .
theirs was a failure not of theory , but of “ data collection . ”
they had “ overlooked ” crucial institutional changes in the financial system .
while this was regrettable , it raised no “ deep conceptual issue ” – that is , it did n’t demand that they reconsider their theory .
the same can not be said for kaczyński.another major difference is that eastern europeans tend to hold more materialist attitudes than westerners , who have moved beyond concerns about physical security to embrace what sociologist ronald inglehart calls post-materialist values .
one aspect of this difference is that eastern european societies are more vulnerable to attacks on abstract liberal institutions such as freedom of speech and judicial independence.this should n’t be too surprising .
after all , liberalism in eastern europe is a western import .
notwithstanding the trump and brexit phenomena , the us and the uk have deeply embedded cultures of political and social liberalism .
in eastern europe , civil society is not just weaker ; it is also more focused on areas such as charity , religion , and leisure , rather than political issues.moreover , in the vastly different political landscape of europe ’s post-communist states , the left is either very weak or completely absent from the political mainstream .
but that is a big “ if . ”
as for the eurozone , we appear to have been too optimistic , even though we foresaw a decline in potential growth to 1.5 % .
nowadays , most forecasters put the region ’s growth potential at around 1 % .
if germany can not shift to a more domestic-demand-driven growth model , that projection will probably turn out to be correct .
yet while most press coverage has focused on germany ’s falling exports and manufacturing output , the country ’s services sector remains strong .
the size of these transfers , however , would depend on the eu 's financial policies at the time of admission , the outcome of accession negotiations , and economic developments in turkey .
in any case , the eu 's practice of " capping " its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by turkey 's accession .
immigration should not be a cause for undue concern , either .
human mobility is limited , and turkey workers ' would probably be allowed to move freely within the eu only after a long transition period , possibly not before 2025 .
given the expected upswing of turkey 's economy and its declining birthrate , experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point .
more than most people realize , the gospels treat recalcitrant jews -- those who refused to accept jesus as their messiah -- as perpetrators of a crime that lives on in every generation .
anti-semites often cite a passage in matthew in which a jewish crowd cheers for christ 's execution and voluntarily accepts permanent guilt : " his blood be on us and on our children . "
matthew then attributes to the jews a recurrent lie explaining away the resurrection and disappearance of jesus 's body : " his disciples came at night and stole him away while we slept . "
the later evangelist john concludes that because jews deny the christian messiah they must be " sons of the devil . "
just as whites attribute extraordinary sexual powers to black men , the christian west 's instinct is to treat jews as the masters of extraordinary forces -- including the power to kill deities and control world finance .
but with too much macho , too much politics and provincialism , reform never happened .
so the idea that “ this country is different , ” that the rules of global finance did not apply , proved utter nonsense .
by the time crisis came , thailand looked like all the others who turn in desperation to the imf .
thailand ’s decision last may to cut interest rates made it a safe gamble to bet against the bhat , the opening salvo in the crisis .
encouraged by the illusion of a strong reserve position , the thai central bank took on the speculators -- and lost .
it was not least thanks to the effort of the protest movements that france has now made concessions on both these counts .
but how can these concessions , given under duress , be secured ?
that is a task for which non-governmental organizations and protest movements are not well equipped : they can raise public conscience , but they can not formally commit governments .
only other governments can do that .
hence the effort to nail down the concessions that the protests have extracted , the hour of governments has arrived .
compounding the challenge , the cohort of informed elites in russia is growing .
as the top russian propagandist dmitry kiselev recently acknowledged , “ higher learning in the humanities ( and social sciences ) breeds social unrest . ”
not surprisingly , he complained that “ too many ” russians are studying these subjects .
the majority of russia ’s population will not become well-informed overnight .
but , as the regime is forced to dedicate more resources to silencing the informed , the majority will suffer economically .
london – officials at the people ’s bank of china ( pboc ) have long insisted that “ china wo n’t weaponize the renminbi . ”
and yet , implicit in their promise not to manipulate the currency for strategic ends is their ability to do so if they so desired .
china ’s monetary policy has come to the fore now that us president donald trump has imposed import tariffs on a range of chinese goods .
many are wondering if china will respond to trump ’s trade war by threatening a currency war .
if it does , the world should call its bluff .
it would seem that in addition to contributing to the size and productivity of the workforce , immigrants also often complement the skills of native-born workers , helping them earn more .
my professional focus is on economics , so i have emphasized the role of growth .
but that clearly is not the only factor behind the rise of populist nationalism .
the fact that developed countries are changing culturally also matters , perhaps even more so .
in the us , for example , the foreign-born share of the population has risen from 5 % in 1960 to around 14 % today .
that shift , in turn , clears the way for a generational change in leadership – and , more importantly , a transition to post-oslo politics .
the plo ’s old guard – men like yasser arafat and abbas , who led the liberation organization from exile and returned home with the oslo accords – dominated the palestinian political landscape up to now .
after they depart the scene , palestinian leaders who were born under occupation and spent time in israeli prisons will most likely fill the vacuum .
the most prominent such figure is marwan barghouti , the leader of the student movement at birzeit university in the 1980 ’s and one of the main organizers of the first intifada , resulting in his deportation by israel in the late 1980 ’s .
in 2002 , he was arrested and sentenced to a long prison term on charges that he led the second intifada , which had begun two years earlier , and ordered some of its military attacks .
these are the key ingredients in the nationalist stew that seems to appeal to russians nowadays .
judging by putin ’s most recent address to parliament , his regime is fully aware of the danger posed by populist nationalists .
it is likely that the regime will attempt to counter this eruption of nationalism while maintaining its strong statist rhetoric .
but , in order to defeat the far right , putin ’s regime will be forced to take its stand on more or less liberal ideological grounds .
this wo n’t be easy for a regime based on the twin pillars of bureaucracy and the security apparatus .
in taiwan , tsai is equally committed .
last year , responding to public opposition to nuclear energy in the wake of japan ’s 2011 fukushima meltdown , tsai vowed to make taiwan nuclear-free by 2025 .
today , coal and natural gas provide more than two thirds of the country ’s electricity needs , with renewables accounting for 5 % .
tsai has called for the share of renewables to increase to 20 % over the next eight years , with the capacity coming primarily from solar and offshore wind .
this new load would easily replace the electricity generated by the country ’s six nuclear reactors .
as production of these fuels grows , we will require policies , programs , and capacities that ensure that they are used sustainably , without distorting food markets or compromising food security , which will always be the first priority .
the pioneers of biofuels would probably be surprised by how little they contribute to the total world fuel supply today .
rudolf diesel ’s first engine , designed in the late 1800s , ran on fuel derived from peanut oil .
henry ford once scouted florida in hopes of buying tracts of land to plant sugar cane , convinced that the united states would not tolerate the pollution from burning fossil fuels or the dependency implicit in importing oil to produce gasoline .
only in recent decades have biofuels regained their original appeal , owing to efforts to secure affordable energy , generate income , and mitigate the dependency of which ford warned .
many british people believed in a “ free trade empire . ”
others fanned the flames of anglo-german antagonism , caricaturing protectionist germany as a barbarian society surviving on horse sausages and dog-meat ; lloyd george , the future prime minister , told audiences that he was more afraid of the german sausage than he was of the german navy .
one reason that free trade defeated protectionism in britain a century ago was that its supporters appealed to people ’s emotions and identities , not just their rational interest in more wealth and cheap food .
liberals and radicals organized traveling shows , color posters , and political entertainment .
in towns , displays in shop windows illustrated the costs of tariffs to ordinary consumers .
an inordinately lax regulatory environment proved lethal , encouraging northern european banks to pad their balance sheets with southern european government and bank bonds .
when the bubble burst , it left in its wake woefully expensive economies that had lost their competitiveness .
europe should now use the calm between the storm fronts to rethink the european currency union from the ground up .
the effort to create a european equivalent of the dollar and impose a fiscal union on top of it , despite the absence of a common european state , is bound to fail .
it will turn member countries into debtors and creditors to each other , stoking even more animosity .
indeed , the latter now stand at more than 15 % of gdp .
the hits chinese exports are likely to take as a result of the region ’s currency depreciations are , nevertheless , unlikely to be felt immediately .
rival asian economies will need to be stabilized before they can push their exports aggressively .
moreover , inflation in some asean countries may rise with the coming of floating exchange rates .
because of this , the price competitiveness of their exports may be lessened .
moreover , there are real disagreements within the us bureaucracy when it comes to assessing the threat that al qaeda in mali poses for us interests .
following from above thus has operational and symbolic significance .
operationally , it is limited to isr and does not involve ground troops .
symbolically , it means backing initial and significant efforts undertaken by others .
for europe , this situation is worrying on two counts .
the private sector had large foreign assets , while the government had about the same amount of foreign liabilities .
even so , argentina went bankrupt , because wealthy argentines had spirited their assets out of the country , and thus out of the reach of the government , while poor argentines refused to pay the taxes needed to satisfy foreign creditors ’ claims .
on the other hand , when the foreign assets of the country are held not by households , but by institutions , such as pension funds , they can be identified and taxed .
this is mostly the case in europe .
this analysis suggests that the “ excessive [ current-account ] imbalances ” procedure that is to be introduced under the ongoing reform of eurozone governance goes in the right direction .
disappointed in their political leaders , algerians ’ unity stems in large part from their shared love of football .
the stars of barcelona , real madrid , chelsea , and milan are household names .
but exposure to foreign television stations also means that many disillusioned algerians are looking towards escape to italy , france , or germany as their only hope of employment and a decent life .
will the coming months bring genuine change to algeria ?
will social and economic reforms be implemented to ensure an equitable distribution of the country ’s oil and gas wealth ?
lower interest rates worked , but not so much because they boosted investment , but because they led households to refinance their mortgages , and fueled a bubble in housing prices .
in short , as greenspan departs , he leaves behind an american economy burdened with high household and government debt and fragile balance sheets – a legacy that is already contributing to global financial instability .
it is still not clear what led greenspan to support the tax cut .
was it a massive economic misjudgment , or was he currying favor with the bush administration ?
the most likely explanation is a combination of the two , for he and bush were pursuing the same “ starve the beast ” political strategy , which calls for tax cuts to be used to reduce revenues , thereby forcing the public sector to be downsized .
ethiopia is hardly the only recent example of how conflicts over land rights can set the stage for political and humanitarian crises .
competition for arable land contributed to the rwandan genocide in 1994 .
a historic drought may have created the conditions for syria ’s civil war .
and food insecurity stemming from land mismanagement is an important factor driving migrants to europe .
land-related issues will continue to threaten global stability , especially if the effects of climate change exacerbate existing problems .
because they lead far more carbon-intensive lifestyles than everyone else , they would contribute far more per capita to the carbon dividend .
more to the point , they would pay in much more than they get back , while the poorest 60 % of americans would get back more than they put in .
in short , a carbon dividend would distribute money from predominantly wealthy high polluters to predominantly low - and middle-income low polluters , all while reducing co2 emissions .
on its own , it would represent a smart step in the right direction – one that would n’t invite a “ yellow vest ” reaction .
but do n’t let anyone tell you it ’s a silver bullet .
a further lesson for sarkozy from germany is that an enlightened corporate state needs supportive political leadership as well as accommodating trade unions .
german chancellor angela merkel does n’t make speeches attacking the strong euro and the european central bank ’s price stability mandate .
on the contrary , she supports an independent ecb and has let germany ’s trade unions and companies know that they will have to live with a strong currency and an anti-inflationary monetary policy .
this does not mean that merkel is a free market capitalist – there is little evidence of that .
rather , she simply understands that for an economy that needs to stay competitive , bad-mouthing the euro and the ecb sends the wrong signals .
owing to its geopolitical weight , germany ’s perspective is now synonymous with that of the european union .
and the eu ’s outlook is not that of a hegemon ; rather , it is concerned with the rule of law , integration , and peaceful reconciliation of member states ’ interests .
germany ’s location alone makes nationalism a bad idea ; and besides , its most fundamental political and economic interests depend on a strong , successful eu – especially in the age of trump .
germany is in the same boat as all other europeans with respect to security .
just as there can be no french security without germany , there can be no german security without poland .
the same is true of antidepressants .
there is no dispute that ect can cause short-term memory loss .
but critics have found it difficult to demonstrate memory or other cognitive problems that endure beyond three months .
nor can enduring autobiographical memory disturbances and inability to remember lists be readily attributed to ect , because ect is rarely given on its own .
indeed , very few of those who receive ect do not also receive benzodiazepines , which do cause significant autobiographical memory problems when given alone , and antipsychotic drugs , which cause difficulties with lists of names or telephone numbers , and other comparable problems .
if they were , there would be no need for domestic bankruptcy law , which spells out issues like precedence and fair treatment .
but no government has found cacs adequate for resolving domestic restructuring .
so why should we think that they would suffice in the much more complex world of sovereign-debt restructurings ?
in particular , cacs suffer from the problem of “ aggregation . ”
if a cac required , say , 75 % of the holders of each bond class , vultures could buy 26 % of only one bond class and block the entire restructuring .
instead , it should strengthen the case for open dialogue and tough negotiation – precisely what has long been lacking in western policy on the ukraine crisis and toward the entirety of the post-soviet eurasian region .
we have arrived at this point precisely because both russia and the west have spent over a decade seeking unilateral advantages and eschewing negotiated compromises .
holding talks in the current atmosphere of mistrust , mutual recrimination , and fearmongering will require a substantial investment of political capital for a sustained period .
moving beyond current adversarial approaches to find common ground will take time .
a quick deal wo n’t be possible .
but it also represents the global gold standard in many fields , including technology , defense , and research and development .
contrary to china ’s statist legacy , america ’s historical experience has instilled in citizens and leaders a devotion to liberty , including free markets , and local autonomy .
the us federal government ’s size and power grew only very slowly until the 1930s , when the new deal – which included federal programs , public works projects , and financial reforms and regulations – was implemented in response to the great depression .
the us federal government expanded again during and after wwii , reflecting the country ’s new global hegemony and the prosperity of its middle class ( created in no small part by the new deal ’s support for unionization and home ownership ) .
the government assumed a larger role in areas ranging from defense and foreign policy to health care and social security .
the exact number of european fighters who have received training from isis and returned home is still unknown .
abdelhamid abaaoud , who led the november 2015 paris attacks , claimed he was one of 90 isis-trained terrorists in europe .
isis has allegedly trained 400-600 fighters for “ external operations ” involving urban guerrilla warfare , improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) , surveillance , counter-security , and forgery .
isis has so far hit france and turkey the hardest .
france has suffered more than 230 deaths and about 700 injuries , while turkey has endured more than 220 deaths and about 900 injuries .
to account for the learning crisis in many developing countries , governments and development agencies should look for more opportunities to form strategic partnerships with non-state providers .
in bangladesh , for example , schools run by brac employ female teachers ( which is key to increasing girls ’ enrollment ) , and outperform government-run schools in terms of learning outcomes .
fortunately , the afghan government has begun to open its doors to innovative ngo models like brac ’s community-based education program .
but a shortage of qualified female teachers makes scaling up such efforts difficult to impossible .
women account for just one-third of all teachers in afghan primary and secondary schools , partly owing to extremely low female literacy .
these economic shocks have exposed the huge costs of each country ’s sectarian-based political system .
and demonstrators , driven by economic grievances , have been emboldened by an improvement in broader security conditions , owing to the defeat of the islamic state and the wind-down of the war in syria .
in all four of these countries , the severity of economic mismanagement reflects the long-standing use of state expenditures to finance the regime ’s allies and clients , rather than to benefit the whole population .
these regimes have dominated each country ’s private sector through cronyism , not just to extract and distribute rents to clients , but also to block the emergence of autonomous entities that could finance an opposition movement .
as a result , capital and skills have been misallocated , the business climate has deteriorated , and competition , innovation , and growth have suffered .
but the decreased flexibility in response to economic shocks will certainly test it .
at present , it is boldly highlighting the disparate , even discordant , fiscal responses now being embraced by european union governments .
this raises the old question about whether a currency union can work without a fiscal union , or at least stronger and more binding fiscal rules ( the maastricht deficit commitments are too easily breached ) .
to that we must add coordinated financial regulation and bailout policies , as deposits flow rapidly across borders in response to national guarantees and insurance in the euro zone .
will the euro ’s second decade be as successful as the first ?
today , language barriers prevent many immigrant parents from helping their children with their homework because the texts are only in english .
but imagine a world where textbooks are adapted to many learning styles and translated into myriad languages .
today , pluto remains on the list of planets in science textbooks , and who knows how long it will take for it to be removed .
but imagine a world where textbooks are continually updated and corrected by a legion of contributors .
such a world was just a dream a decade ago .
if only they could take place in china .
one strong school of thought that emerged almost as soon as the killing began in 1989 , is that the more radical student leaders had been reckless .
it should have been clear to them that a violent crackdown was inevitable .
by provoking the regime , the students derailed any chance of slow political reform , which their more moderate elders had carefully set in train .
indeed , so proponents of this school often add , china was not yet ready for democracy .
delivery problems abound in the war zones , but not everywhere .
yet international donors are dragging their feet both in meeting existing commitments and in making new ones .
and all the aid in the world wo n’t stop the killing .
it is too late now for non-military tools of coercion to have much effect , although security council threats of international criminal court prosecution for atrocity crimes – including any use of chemical weapons – must remain on the table .
but what of the military-response options still strongly favored by many policymakers and pundits ?
for example , when trump calls for a reduction in us military involvement in the middle east , he is merely echoing obama .
yet by reneging on the nuclear deal with iran , trump has made war in the region more likely .
and by going out of his way to alleviate north korea ’s international isolation , while getting almost nothing in return , he has strengthened china ’s position in east asia .
trump ’s global trade war is equally self-defeating .
by slapping tariffs on america ’s closest allies , he is practically driving them into china ’s arms .
each country could create a council that represents public bodies ( transportation , public works , customs ) and major users ( exporters and logistics companies ) that must work together to identify ways to reduce logistics costs .
communication between users and government services is vital to achieve any real improvement .
it is just as vital , though , for committees to be developed along similar lines in the provincial areas of each country .
merchandise need n’t pass through the capital , as it does in most latin american and caribbean countries , with the associated cost increases .
regions then can be turned into engines of growth .
the fdp ’s ideas have broad support in germany and among german economists ( and are shared by a number of other european economists ) .
and they are consistent with positions taken by the german ministry of finance under the previous government .
but policies that might work in a perfect world of efficient and resilient financial markets could be dangerous if applied in highly imperfect real-world markets .
as we saw a decade ago , financial institutions operating in an environment of uncertainty can become fragile and collapse , imposing high costs on society .
the idea of a temporary exit from the euro is particularly ill-advised .
will it return to robust growth , or will we have an anemic recovery , à la japan in the 1990 ’s ?
right now , i cast my vote for the latter , especially since the huge debt legacy is likely to dampen enthusiasm for the big stimulus that is required .
without a sufficiently large stimulus ( in excess of 2 % of gdp ) , we will have a vicious negative spiral : a weak economy will mean more bankruptcies , which will push stock prices down and interest rates up , undermine consumer confidence , and weaken banks .
consumption and investment will be cut back further .
many wall street financiers , having received their gobs of cash , are returning to their fiscal religion of low deficits .
prague – global free trade provides the greatest opportunity to improve human welfare over the next decade and a half .
it has already helped lift more than a billion people out of poverty over the past quarter-century .
lowering trade barriers even more could double average incomes in the poorest parts of the world over the next 15 years .
yes , there are costs to free trade that must be better addressed ; but the costs are vastly outweighed by the benefits .
yet , in rich countries today , the mood has turned against free trade .
however , muslims in sub-saharan africa , like most muslims around the world , exhibit an “ us versus them ” mentality .
when muslims form a minority , they have tended to co-exist peacefully with other religions , but where their populations are substantial ( as in nigeria ) , they tend to assert themselves .
whatever ethnic and other divisions are at stake , the “ us versus them ” sentiment has played a large role in fomenting religious conflict in nigeria .
nevertheless , nigeria ( and perhaps zanzibar ) remains an exception in islamic assertiveness in sub-saharan africa , which is why the idea of an active “ islamic world ” includes only a relatively limited segment of sub-saharan african muslims .
whether they like it or not , the majority of sub-saharan african muslims are represented by states that are mostly secular , christian , or dominated by other religions .
indeed , piketty argues that our “ obsession with growth ” merely “ serves as an excuse for not doing anything about health , about education , or about redistribution . ”
and it is an obsession rooted very much in the present .
“ we forget that for centuries growth was essentially zero , ” he writes .
“ one percent real growth means doubling the size of your economy every 30 or 35 years . ”
piketty sees that as grounds “ to be a little optimistic . ”
for good reason , many europeans are sensitive to issues of human rights in hong kong , xinjiang , and elsewhere .
europeans are also rightly worried about economic issues .
as the european commission warned earlier this year ( under its previous leadership ) , china is “ an economic competitor in the pursuit of technological leadership , and a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance . ”
this language represents a sharp departure from that of previous official eu communiqués .
the next year will be critical .
although the democrats have often criticized trump ’s approach , they are not proposing further trade liberalization .
a final question to consider when assessing the us presidential candidates is whom each would appoint as the next chair of the us federal reserve .
trump – who has repeatedly criticized current chair jerome powell for pursuing too little monetary-policy easing – would probably select a dovish candidate .
a left-leaning democrat might do the same , given the left ’s fascination with risky ideas that promote massive amounts of fed-funded debt .
center-leftists – biden , amy klobuchar , pete buttigieg – might reappoint powell , who has done a good job , or select a moderate democratic economist , such as former fed vice chair alan blinder or former treasury secretary larry summers .
the boston globe , for example , ran an article about the man – identified only by his first name , danny – whom the brothers carjacked three days after the attack .
danny claimed that the only word of the brothers ’ conversation that he understood was “ manhattan , ” and that the terrorists had asked him if his car could leave the state – say , to get to new york .
the globe ’s one-source report proved nothing – and was unverifiable by other reporters or citizens – but it suggested much , leading to a spate of equally unverifiable reports that new york had been targeted .
other recent “ terror ” - related reporting has been as flimsy .
in charles savage ’s recent account of the guantánamo “ uprising , ” the new york times credulously reproduced the “ arsenal ” that gitmo officials showed reporters in a video still .
at the same time , these gains have not been evenly distributed , and sub-saharan africa has seen far less progress than other areas .
the second study , funded by ifad and recently released by the international food policy research institute , examines the worldwide economic downturn starting in 2012 in the context of rural populations .
it finds that as a result of the downturn , 38 million more people will remain in extreme poverty in 2030 than likely would have otherwise , with farm households in middle-income countries particularly at risk .
this poses a serious challenge for the sdgs to end poverty “ in all its forms everywhere , ” and it strengthens the case for policies and investments specifically targeting rural areas , which is where poverty-reduction measures are needed more and will have a larger impact .
rural areas ’ progress so far reveals their future potential .
these policies could then be entirely subjugated to the demands of the gold standard and free capital mobility .
but once the political franchise was enlarged , the working class got organized , and mass politics became the norm , domestic economic objectives began to compete with ( and overwhelm ) external rules and constraints .
the classic case is britain ’s short-lived return to gold in the interwar period .
the attempt to reconstitute the pre-world war i model of globalization collapsed in 1931 , when domestic politics forced the british government to choose domestic reflation over the gold standard .
the architects of the bretton woods regime kept this lesson in mind when they redesigned the world ’s monetary system in 1944 .
washington , dc – over 60 % of all employed women in sub-saharan africa work in agriculture .
yet the region ’s women farmers often reap a meager harvest , not because of inclement weather or poor soil quality , but because of their gender – or , more specifically , because of a dense web of laws , policies , programs , and customs that put them at a significant disadvantage .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
beyond the need to alleviate the human misery that fills television screens and front pages of newspapers lies the imperative not to miss the significant medium-term opportunities that migration provides .
although there are pockets of high unemployment in europe today , the ratio of workers to elderly people will decline considerably in the longer term .
and , already , labor-market flexibility has been undermined by structural inertia , including difficulties in retooling and retraining workers , particularly the long-term unemployed .
as the german government and some corporate leaders , including the ceo of daimler-benz , have already recognized , an open-minded approach to refugee absorption and integration can help to mitigate some of europe ’s protracted structural problems .
after all , a significant proportion of the incoming refugee population is said to be educated , motivated , and committed to building a better future in their new homes .
for example , if an independent worker drives one hour for uber , and walks a dog for another hour on rover , each platform would contribute an equal amount toward his or her benefits .
this would enable independent workers to accumulate and manage their benefits , and eventually acquire a safety net like that of a full-time contracted employee .
with digital commerce estimated to benefit at least 80 million young africans by 2030 , opportunities for gig workers will increase .
and if access to a range of valued benefits , from health insurance to pensions , is made conditional on registering their business and paying taxes , they will have a powerful reason to formalize their work .
digitization could enable the formal sector to offer a spectrum of benefits for workers and responsibilities for employers .
for starters , they must take action to protect the rural environment , ensure animal welfare , and improve education , knowledge transfer , and business training for farmers and agricultural workers .
british policymakers must also move beyond ad hoc responses to natural and man-made disasters , by building more effective and reliable protection systems .
for example , they could facilitate the provision of affordable insurance for farmers or create some type of mutual-assistance scheme .
implementing ( and funding ) such initiatives will require sustained political will .
the uk must also ensure that its agricultural sector can take advantage of new technologies .
frankfurt – the european central bank is in the middle of a big , risky experiment .
key interest rates have remained close to zero for six years now .
financial markets are flooded with liquidity .
crisis management has resulted in major market distortions , with some segments ’ performance no longer explainable by fundamental economic data .
the unintended consequences of this policy are increasingly visible – and will become increasingly tangible with the us federal reserve ’s exit from post-2008 ultra-loose monetary policy .
it is easy to forget that , years ago , telephones had no buttons or dial – you had to pick up the handset and ask an operator to make the connection .
the telephone dial did n’t appear until 1919 , when the first group of self-designated “ user interface scientists ” at western electric considered what the most intuitive form should be .
when improving a computer interface , form is the key .
we ’ve seen hints of a new paradigm in apple ’s iphone , which allows gestural finger motions , but in the intelligence community , concept visualization can be so radical that most ordinary users might barely recognize what it was .
designs are inspired by cognitive science , the arts , even science fiction .
but that is still not the whole story .
as plato tells us , prometheus ’s name means “ foresight , ” because he was always looking ahead , unlike his carefree brother , epimetheus , whose name means “ hindsight . ”
as the more rational and justifiably paranoid of the two , prometheus tried to warn his brother not to accept zeus ’s dangerous gift .
but epimetheus was charmed by pandora and heedlessly welcomed her into his life .
only later did he come to realize his terrible error .
chances are they will do so again .
indeed , downplaying the gravity of the latest crisis is easy : one can argue that the immediate cause of the breakdown , when examined closely , is not really all that serious .
the crux of the problem is that the draft constitution would give the eu a new and much simpler method of taking majority votes in the council of ministers .
under the method adopted three years ago at the eu 's nice summit , each member state has a certain number of votes , weighted according to population , but small countries are protected by having proportionally more votes than big countries .
this system is known as qualified majority vote .
rome – the prices of many staple foods increased dramatically during 2007-2008 , creating a food crisis for many poor and developing countries .
international prices of maize , rice , and wheat , for example , reached their highest levels in 30 years , causing political and economic instability – and leading to food riots – in many countries .
several factors contributed to the crisis , including high oil prices , high demand for crops from the bio-fuel sector , falling global stockpiles of food commodities , and lower cereal production .
strong economic growth and expansive monetary policies further boosted the trend , as did protectionist measures , such as export restrictions .
while these factors undoubtedly placed upward pressure on food prices , they alone can not explain the steep hikes .
the similarities with the views of the islamic state are glaring .
in a video produced after the battle for the mosul dam in august , the group called for the “ end of sykes-picot , ” and proclaimed the need to redraw the western-imposed political map of the middle east .
erdoğan ’s ambition to restore turkey ’s primacy in the sunni world is driving him to collude with this challenge to the western-devised regional order .
indeed , turkey has been offering logistical support to the islamic state , even as it has enabled the group ’s murderous members to massacre thousands of civilian kurds and yazidis in the syrian town of kobani on turkey ’s doorstep .
this highlights another issue on which turkey and the islamic state converge : the kurds .
so far , he has refrained from claiming outright that these markets act at the behest of “ world jewry ” ( the architects , many turkish islamists believe , of the 1908 young turk revolution and the secular republic that arose after world war i ) .
but his core supporters hear the dog whistle behind his condemnations of the forces of finance – forces that now seem to be demanding higher interest rates .
but perhaps no current leader is more susceptible to misbegotten science and half-baked conspiracy theories than the us president and wannabe authoritarian , donald trump .
it should never be forgotten that trump wormed his way into us politics by promoting the racist “ birther ” argument , which claimed that then-president barack obama was not born in the us and therefore did not qualify for the office he held .
since entering the white house , the lunacy has only grown .
we are also doing everything possible to make ukraine attractive to foreign investors .
in the energy sector , we are privatizing state-owned energy distributors .
to ensure complete transparency in the tender process , and eliminate problems experienced in the past , western advisors are assisting us .
for our intention is to attract large western energy companies with experience in this field as strategic investors .
ten leading international energy companies , indeed , will participate in the privatization of the first group of companies .
even so , chinese policy choices significantly influence other asian countries , with china ’s “ state capitalist ” economic model now being mimicked elsewhere in the region .
of course , japan , korea , and singapore had similar policy models in the past ( though they later adapted them in line with their gdp growth ) .
now , however , these countries are once again espousing forms of state capitalism and a return to industrial policy ( encouraged as well by the 2008 global financial meltdown , which gave a new rationale for a return to government intervention ) .
in japan , postal services that had been privatized are to be re-nationalized , and the role of government finance is being strengthened .
japan air lines , which was almost bankrupt , was rescued by a government bailout , a device that seems to be increasingly common .
without the ecb ’s commitment , in place since 2012 , to prevent sovereign-debt yields from soaring , there would be a persistent risk to the eurozone – and , indeed , to the entire edifice of the european union – of sovereign-debt defaults .
but at least europe has benefited from falling commodity prices .
by contrast , many emerging economies , highly dependent on commodity export earnings , have been stressed by the commodity-price reset , sluggish growth in developed economies , and slower growth in china .
capital flight would materially add to their plight – in some cases disastrously so .
since the 2008 financial crisis , the world has become accustomed to such linkages and spillovers .
let the world recall that gaza ’s crisis is a manmade disaster .
and let the world take note that conditions are worse today than at any time since the occupation began .
seventy-nine percent of gaza ’s households live in poverty ; eight out of ten depend on food assistance .
almost half the labor force is unemployed ; local industry has collapsed .
water and sewage systems are failing ; garbage is piling up in the streets .
new york – the european union needs to accept responsibility for the lack of a common asylum policy , which has transformed this year ’s growing influx of refugees from a manageable problem into yet another political crisis .
each member state has selfishly focused on its own interests , often acting against the interests of others .
this precipitated panic among asylum seekers , the general public , and the authorities responsible for law and order .
asylum seekers have been the main victims .
the eu needs a comprehensive plan to respond to the crisis , one that reasserts effective governance over the flows of asylum-seekers so that they take place in a safe , orderly way , and at a pace that reflects europe ’s capacity to absorb them .
the economists would concede that xi ’s campaign has also conveniently removed many of his potential rivals .
but they would argue that his strengthened position now allows him to replace a growth model based on credit-financed debt with something more sustainable .
of course , whether they are right about that remains to be seen .
despite xi ’s success in consolidating his power and extending his hold on it indefinitely , there is reason to doubt that he would be willing to risk a new economic model if sustainability proves to be incompatible with maintaining rapid growth .
this is where the technologists come in , by offering new ways to correct or avoid potential mistakes .
american economist martin feldstein wrote in 1997 that monetary union would create conflict within europe .
at the time , he was derided and regarded as an entrenched opponent of the european project .
unfortunately , his insight was correct : european countries today are at loggerheads not despite the common currency , but precisely because of it .
history suggests that international disputes over debt and transfers are a serious danger .
in the 1920 ’s and the 1930 ’s , representatives of european states devoted countless meetings to resolving them ( at the time , mainly german reparations ) .
whereas the main distinction in nineteen eighty-four is between rulers and ruled , in brave new world , people are divided into different social orders defined by disparate tastes and lifestyles .
the same could be said of china today , where the gaps between rich and poor , urban and rural populations , and coastal and inland culture are so great that it is much harder than before for people from varied walks of life to feel that they share common plights and goals .
of course , no single novel provides a perfect lens through which to view any society .
sometimes , such as when violence was recently used to quell south chinese peasants protesting official land grabs , the ccp still shows its willingness to use “ boot-on-the-face ” suppression .
still , there have been more moments lately that favor huxley ’s vision of political order over that of orwell .
there are similar trends in many european countries as well , especially in southern europe .
this suggests that progressive politicians who envisage an active government role in reshaping economic opportunities face an uphill battle in winning over the electorate .
the fear of losing that battle may explain the timidity of the left ’s response .
yet the lesson of recent studies is that beliefs about what the government can and should do are not immutable .
they are susceptible to persuasion , experience , and changing circumstances .
copenhagen – in one of his first public policy statements as america ’s president-elect , barack obama focused on climate change , and clearly stated both his priorities and the facts on which these priorities rest .
unfortunately , both are weak , or even wrong .
obama ’s policy outline was presented via video to california governor arnold schwarzenegger ’s governors ’ global warming summit , and has again been shown in poznan , poland , to leaders assembled to flesh out a global warming roadmap .
according to obama , “ few challenges facing america and the world are more urgent than combating climate change . ”
such a statement is now commonplace for most political leaders around the world , even though it neglects to address the question of how much we can do to help america and the world through climate policies versus other policies .
before creating an overseas empire – first in north america and the caribbean , then in india and southeast asia – the english built a land empire , by expanding from the south of the british isles to the northwest .
thus , while the “ outer empire ” allowed for the convergence of the uk ’s different national identities around a common british identity , the “ inner empire ” was decidedly english .
still , for centuries the british empire generated wealth , supplied raw materials , and created globe-spanning professional opportunities for all inhabitants of the british isles .
its “ civilizing ” mission created a sense of collective meaning , as well as a narrative of uninterrupted democratic and economic progress .
but the fusion of identities was always incomplete , not least in ireland , where the fallout from independence still reverberates a century later , through the uncertainty generated by the northern irish “ backstop . ”
freedom of expression and other fundamental rights are not elitist luxuries , as authoritarians claim .
they are indispensable for safeguarding free societies .
moreover , a concerted campaign against corruption could serve as a unifying force in countries with deep political divisions .
while a majoritarian government can ride roughshod over the interests of minorities , corrupt regimes steal from everyone .
that is why corruption has provoked mass protests from bucharest to brasilia over the past year .
trump ’s geopolitical and economic views should be judged against this background of disenchantment , not by an ideal moral or economic standard .
in other words , trumpism could be a solution to the crisis of liberalism , not a portent of its disintegration .
viewed this way , trump ’s isolationism is a populist way of saying that the us needs to withdraw from commitments which it has neither the power nor the will to honor .
the promise to work with russia to end the savage conflict in syria is sensible , even though it implies the victory of bashar al-assad ’s regime .
disengaging peacefully from exposed global responsibilities will be trump ’s biggest challenge .
madrid – back in 1996 , binyamin netanyahu won a general election by mobilizing large constituencies against then-prime minister shimon peres ’s alleged intention to “ divide jerusalem . ”
nearly two decades later , netanyahu remains committed to old , vacuous slogans about a “ united jerusalem ” – a conviction that could , yet again , unravel the israel-palestine peace process .
as us secretary of state john kerry prepares to present a framework agreement for a conclusive round of israeli-palestinian peace negotiations , netanyahu ’s hardline position on jerusalem is simply a non-starter .
in a last-ditch effort to improve the proposal ’s chances of success , us president barack obama – who has largely avoided taking a proactive role in the peace process during his second term – met with netanyahu at the white house to urge him to moderate his position .
but changing netanyahu ’s mind will not be easy – not least because of the domestic political pressure that he faces .
new haven – the final day of the summer marked the start of yet another season of futile policymaking by two of the world ’s major central banks – the us federal reserve and the bank of japan .
the fed did nothing , which is precisely the problem .
and the alchemists at the boj unveiled yet another feeble unconventional policy gambit .
both the fed and the boj are pursuing strategies that are woefully disconnected from the economies they have been entrusted to manage .
moreover , their latest actions reinforce a deepening commitment to an increasingly insidious transmission mechanism between monetary policy , financial markets , and asset-dependent economies .
today , in a strategic environment marked by terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , russia is very much part of the solution .
if the prague summit will not showcase any grand new initiative , it is simply because we already launched a new nato-russia relationship last may at our special summit in rome .
the new nato-russia council created in rome offers us an effective and flexible mechanism for joint analysis , joint decisions , and even joint action .
much has already been achieved over the past six months to transform the political message of rome into practical cooperation .
it was henry kissinger who argued after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington of 2001 that tragedy could be turned into opportunity .
to the outside world , suleimani was the mastermind of the regime ’s terrorist activities outside iran , and the puppet master of its proxies across the region , not least hezbollah in lebanon .
yet to iranians , he was a more complicated figure .
while regime hardliners regarded him as a hero , many iranians who have lost loved ones in peaceful demonstrations , or who object to the regime ’s attacks on iranian dissidents in the diaspora , saw him differently .
nonetheless , over the past few years , the regime has pushed a clever public-relations campaign to depict suleimani as a napoleon - or caesar-like warrior-poet .
and as one of the few islamic revolutionary guard corps ( irgc ) commanders not tainted with allegations of corruption , he was mooted as a likely presidential candidate in the next election .
yet he also wants to boost the economy with a € 50 billion ( $ 55 billion ) stimulus package and extend the welfare state .
to square the circle , macron needs growth , and he is relying on supply-side reforms to deliver it .
he plans to cut the corporate-tax rate from 33 % to 25 % and exclude financial investment from wealth taxation .
a vocal critic of protectionism , he will push for the eu-canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the united states .
his support of the el khomri law , which made it easier to fire workers , and his opposition to the 35-hour week , indicate his desire to increase the french labor market ’s “ flexibility . ”
prague : many americans seem overwhelmed by the feeling that , because the soviet empire collapsed , the dangers of war can be crossed off the list of potential risks .
america , they say , should pay attention to its own problems , and should not get involved in a world where its attempts to do good are rewarded with ingratitude .
isolationism has a long tradition in america ; it returns in fits and differing forms .
never in modern times , however , has isolationism protected america from danger ; instead it delays engagement when conflagrations are ablaze .
eventually , america pays a thousand times more for its initial lack of interest than it would have paid had it become engaged at the outset of crisis or , better yet , even before .
here , too , creative solutions can be found .
using the asset-backed security model , we recently joined with the un ’s green climate fund and china to structure a $ 450 million “ green bond ” facility .
this will allow pension funds and insurance companies to finance indirectly the necessary equipment upgrades in mom-and-pop stores and workshops from tijuana to tierra del fuego .
there are many other areas where those committed to fighting climate change can follow our example .
traffic-clogged cities need better public transportation , and financing the expansion of bus rapid transit ( brt ) systems is a proven way to reduce congestion , emissions , and commuting costs .
once again , eurobonds , a green partnership with china , and unity within europe could make all the difference .
such an alliance would also enable a new foreign policy for europe , one that promotes peace and sustainable development , underpinned by new security arrangements that do not depend so heavily on the us .
europe , a magnet for hundreds of millions of would-be economic migrants , could , should , and i believe would regain control of its borders , allowing it to strengthen and enforce necessary limits on migration .
the political terms of a new grand coalition government , it would seem , are clear .
the spd should hold out for ministerial leadership on economic and financial policy , while the cdu/csu holds the chancellorship .
fortunately , that is precisely what abe intends to do .
in any case , the success of monetary policy is difficult to deny .
as the deflation gap narrows , however , the overall impact of monetary policy will weaken , as it increasingly influences prices more than output .
that is why it is time for japan ’s leaders to shift their focus from the demand-focused first and second arrows to the supply-oriented third arrow : a new growth strategy .
when there is sufficient excess supply in the economy , promoting supply-side productivity is practically useless without efforts to boost demand .
race has always been a provocative subject when the needs of science and statistics intersect with politics .
now that debate is once again heating up in france , as the planned introduction of “ ethnic statistics ” has caused a fierce dispute that touches the very heart of french republicanism .
according to a law that dates back to the french revolution , and reconfirmed in 1978 , french government officials are forbidden to collect information about a citizen ’s ethnic or racial origins , whether real or alleged , when conducting a census or other efforts to gathering statistical information on the population .
there are two main reasons for this .
the first is the republican principle , enshrined in the constitution , that recognizes only citizens and does not accept any distinction among them due to origin , race , or religion .
no one prefers to live in a society where bribes must be paid to secure basic public services like health care and education .
eliminating corruption will be possible only with an effective combination of smart prevention strategies and robust law enforcement , underpinned by the belief that greed can be unlearned , accountability can be taught , and impunity can be terminated .
prevention should begin with education aimed at raising citizens ’ expectations of their leaders .
in politics and business , integrity and accountability must be the rule , not the exception .
knowledge-sharing across countries could illuminate the most effective strategies for achieving this goal .
in these countries , ministers are forced to resign for petty infractions that would seem trivial in other countries .
convincing american , russian , nigerian , or chinese citizens that corruption can indeed be controlled might seem to be a futile task .
but the goal is certainly worth embracing , because the evidence is overwhelming : impunity is not only morally noxious ; it is also economically costly and deeply corrosive to wellbeing .
recent studies have shown that when “ generalized trust ” in society is high , economic performance is improved and life satisfaction is higher .
among other reasons , commercial agreements are more easily reached and efficiently implemented .
as they put it , “ the use of fiscal adrenaline could be limited just when it is needed most . ”
there is an urgent need to “ restock the emergency arsenal , ” particularly when there is relatively little scope to relax monetary policy .
the fed began a process of normalizing monetary policy , but has not completed the job , and president donald trump is doing what he can to prevent them from doing so , by heckling from the sidelines .
the three musketeers remain positive about some elements of the post-crisis program .
bank capital has been greatly strengthened , and the transparency of the derivatives markets materially enhanced .
human rights need not take a back seat to doing business with china .
as a case in point , many western observers thought that norway ’s trade relations with china would be undermined when dissident liu xiaobo was invited to receive the nobel peace prize in oslo in december 2010 .
china complained loudly , refused to allow liu to collect the prize , and even threatened norway with financial repercussions .
the same month , however , one of china ’s largest oil companies concluded a drilling contract with norway ’s statoil , clearly signaling that diplomatic tensions would not stop business .
so western diplomats who negotiate with china should call lower-level officials ’ bluff , and focus on the signal-to-noise ratio , bearing in mind that , ultimately , decisions are taken quietly at a higher level by pragmatic leaders who are indeed susceptible to pressure .
that means that the system ’s focus must shift from speculative and proprietary trading to lending and job creation , which implies reforms of financial-sector regulation , and of anti-trust and corporate-governance laws , together with adequate enforcement to ensure that markets do not become rigged casinos .
globalization has made all countries more interdependent , in turn requiring greater global cooperation .
we might hopethat america will show more leadership in reforming the global financial system by advocating for stronger international regulation , a global reserve system , and better ways to restructure sovereign debt ; in addressing global warming ; in democratizing the international economic institutions ; and in providing assistance to poorer countries .
americans should hope for all of this , though i am not sanguine that they will get much of it . & more likely , america will muddle through – here another little program for struggling students and homeowners , there the end of the bush tax cuts for millionaires , but no wholesale tax reform , serious cutbacks in defense spending , or significant progress on global warming .
with the euro crisis likely to continue unabated , america ’s continuing malaise does not bode well for global growth .
of course , that issue is completely outside israel ’s control .
the ongoing fight in the muslim world between sunnis and shi’a recalls the struggle between protestants and catholics in seventeenth-century europe .
so it is little wonder that the saudis , jordanians , egyptians , and the gulf states are seeking to resist iran ’s hegemonic ambitions in the region .
nevertheless , the stakes are far higher than in the seventeenth century , because iran represents a threat that combines a fanatic religion with a determination to acquire nuclear weapons .
indeed , iran is the only country that openly declares its desire to destroy another member of the united nations .
the strategic importance of the dramatic heights , overlooking most of the northern israeli region of galilee , is obvious .
because syria , bereft of soviet support , is less of a threat to israel , jerusalem can be more flexible than before , when the golan was a glacis defending israel not only against syria , but against a bloc seemingly stretching all the way to vladivostok .
so , despite today ’s interruptions , a context for negotiations exists , as well as political will on both sides .
the agendas of both parties are , however , different : while syria focuses on the symbolic meaning of the return of the golan , israel wants specific , entrenched guarantees regarding the security of its northeastern border , as well as an end to syrian-supported hizbullah incursions from lebanon – a country that is virtually a syrian protectorate .
for israel the quid pro quo for returning the golan is not a piece of paper with the usual phrases about peace and coexistence .
in the fall of 1989 , east german soldiers joined their fellow citizens in the protests that brought down the berlin wall .
but , during the same year in china , protesters in beijing were crushed by troops from inner mongolia who did n’t understand mandarin and had no sympathy for big-city dwellers .
while army units or riot squads ( omon ) stationed in moscow are too disgruntled by the recent police and military reforms to participate in a bloody clampdown , special-operations forces from the provinces , staffed with veterans of the chechen war , might cherish the excitement of sticking it to the moscow fat cats .
likewise , army officers from poorer regions are more grateful for the salary hike that putin ’s united russia party announced , with much fanfare , shortly before the recent duma election .
but , while some parts of the security apparatus might support an initial crackdown , violent repression would be difficult to sustain .
but not proceeding would also have been a disaster .
the 1992 crisis proved that the existing system was unstable .
not moving forward to the euro would have set up europe for even more disruptive crises .
that is why european leaders took the ambitious steps that they did .
not proceeding now with bank recapitalization and government bond purchases would similarly lead to disaster .
the us , of course , claims that it , too , knows all about democracy .
but its diplomatic cognitive dissonance – criticizing the egyptian regime while continuing to supply it with military hardware – can serve only to undermine bilateral relations , just as the same american approach to musharraf ’s regime thoroughly eroded us-pakistani ties .
moreover , the consequences of such foreign-policy waffling extend far beyond the middle east .
in november 2009 , when obama visited japan for the first time as president , he emphasized that he was from hawaii and proud to be “ americans ’ first pacific president . ”
two years later , then-secretary of state hillary clinton published “ america ’s pacific century , ” indicating a shift in america ’s global strategy .
mr. bush 's international credibility , they should emphasize , does not suffer through avoiding a war but gains further through controlling iraq 's hitherto covert military effort .
to give additional credence to their praise , they should leave no doubt that if war became the only option they would stand by america .
but they should also emphasize that war is not the only , and certainly not the automatic " serious consequence " to follow from iraqi non-compliance .
of course , some of america 's allies are better suited than others to get these points across to the audience on the other side of the atlantic .
alas the german government , by its conduct in chancellor schroeder 's campaign for re-election last september , maneuvered itself out of having any authority in the matter .
africa ’s small family farmers – already burdened by soil degradation , climate change , and resource competition fueled by surging populations – face an even more challenging bureaucratic hurdle : no paper to prove that the land they call home is theirs .
uncertain of their ability to control their farms into the next season , farmers ’ planning horizons shrink .
instead of investing in terraced fields , planting trees , and buying high-quality fertilizer , africa ’s farmers seek to maximize short-term profits .
this is particularly true of female farmers , who face an additional thicket of discriminatory land laws and customs .
studies show there is no way to reduce poverty , improve nutrition , or achieve other key development goals without strengthening land rights , especially for women .
i think that germany would be better off in a decade under more neo-liberal policies .
but this does not seem to be what the german electorate wants , and this makes the complexion of german politics four years from now incalculable .
coupled with all this is northern european discontent with the central bankers , specifically with the ecb and the euro .
it is not that the end of european monetary union is on the agenda ; it is merely that people have begun thinking about possible low-probability futures in which the end of emu might be placed on the agenda .
that is enough to shake asset prices worldwide .
of course , its organizers are loath to describe it as a sunni party .
rather , it is described as a national party that invites people of all orientations to participate .
that vision has great appeal among those who want to see a less sectarian-based form of politics in iraq .
but , within iraq , there are very few people – sunni or shia – who do not see iraqiyya as a party dedicated to restoring sunni leadership .
the results of the march 2010 general election gave iraqiyya 91 parliamentary seats , two more than the second-place finisher , maliki ’s state of law coalition .
but many are “ zombie banks , ” with too many branches , too few deposits , and funding costs that far exceed those of their more successful peers .
in fact , according to the international monetary fund , some one-third of europe ’s banking sector , representing assets worth $ 8.5 trillion , remains weak and unable to generate sustainable profits .
all of this creates significant downside risks for the eu economy and , ultimately , the entire european political experiment .
restoring stability in europe ’s banking system , by the imf ’s own estimate , will require at least one-third of europe 's banks to close or merge .
for deutsche bank , market speculators already seem to be expecting a merger , such as with commerzbank , another german institution .
they should take particular care to prevent real-estate bubbles , because real estate constitutes a huge share of overall wealth and a key source of collateral in finance .
but the strong rise of low quality leveraged loans should also be a concern .
none of this will be easy for governments , regulators , or central banks .
monetary tightening may slow growth temporarily ; preventing the growth of bubbles is notoriously difficult ; and the types of structural reforms needed to secure a shift away from debt-fueled growth are hardly ever popular .
today ’s febrile political environment certainly will not simplify matters .
so it might be a good idea for the eu to prepare a mechanism that spells out how debt can be trimmed .
many economists have argued this case on the basis of arithmetic calculation .
but the european central bank , notably by ecb board member lorenzo bini smaghi , has elegantly spelled out the case against debt reduction – a case that is politically significant and deeply moral .
indeed , the principle of not reneging on public debt is deeply intertwined with the development of legal security , representative government , and modern democracy .
in the wake of the glorious revolution of 1688 , when britain revolted against the spendthrift stuart dynasty , the british government adopted a new approach to debt .
in fact , some conservative republicans have objected to another of his appointments , marvin goodfriend of carnegie mellon university , for daring to suggest that the fed might need a new approach to monetary policy ( negative interest rates ) to confront the next very deep recession or financial crisis .
and although someday the fed will almost surely embrace this advice ( i have also published on the issue ) , goodfriend ’s nomination barely survived the us senate banking committee .
but , by and large , the senate has given trump what he wants , and many republicans would have embraced a disrupter – for example , a disciple of ron “ end the fed ” paul – or another conservative preaching a return to the pre-world war i gold standard .
unfortunately , the battle for the fed ’s independence is far from over .
trump may just be keeping his powder dry until a real conflict erupts .
yet india continues to face many challenges : nearly 300 million people living in poverty , the spreading naxalite insurgency , the danger of terrorist attacks ala mumbai , and sprawling urban slums .
in addition , how will singh balance the trade-off between pro-market and pro-poor policies ?
how will he manage the growing middle class ’s expectations of better infrastructure , expanded access to health care and education , uninterrupted electricity and water supplies , and more efficient transport facilities ?
these problems will not be solved overnight .
but the growing conviction that tomorrow will be better will keep india ’s polity stable .
empirically , few firms get this right : america ’s national public radio and the bbc were both recently hacked by the sea , while mcdonald ’s and burger king recently had their twitter accounts compromised .
the proliferation of security lapses means that people are more likely to shrug their shoulders than to cast the first stone at a company that is breached .
finally , the ap is unlikely to face financial penalties for this mistake .
a lawsuit for losses stemming from the hoaxed tweet would face nearly insurmountable obstacles .
because few mechanisms can prevent the proliferation of hoaxed tweets , and given the high-profile response that successful hackers can expect , twitter will remain a vehicle of malicious hoaxes , even as technological barriers make attacks more challenging .
detection means determining whether an extreme event is part of usual weather fluctuations or a symptom of deeper , long-term change .
attribution means the ability to assign the likely causes of an event to human activity or other factors .
the new science of detection and attribution is sharpening our knowledge – and also giving us even more cause for concern .
several studies in the past year have shown that scientists can indeed detect long-term climate change in the rising frequency of extreme events – such as heat waves , heavy rains , severe droughts , and strong storms .
by using cutting-edge climate models , scientists are not only detecting long-term climate change , but also are attributing at least some of the extreme events to human causes .
the mutual assessment process to which the g-20 countries have agreed is a crucial component of the rebalancing program , for it is where the pieces of a cooperative strategy for growth will be identified , evaluated , and assembled .
if it works , what will emerge will be commitments from g-20 countries to undertake policies that are globally beneficial – on the condition that others are keeping their commitments .
the us may reduce its deficits faster than it would in the non-cooperative case , but only if surplus countries are working to reduce their excess savings .
rebalancing is not the only cooperative imperative .
the international exchange-rate system is at least partially broken .
given the power of major tech companies to stifle competition , reversing these trends will require government intervention .
and , indeed , taming big tech has become a major issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election in the united states .
in particular , senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren – in my view , the two strongest candidates vying for the democratic party ’s nomination to challenge president donald trump – have called for breaking up major tech companies .
but the solutions being proposed , including by legal scholars like lina khan , tend to focus on making better use of antitrust laws .
this approach is unlikely to work , because markets have changed dramatically since antitrust laws were conceived .
during each of my field visits , i have been amazed at how these efforts are affecting women ’s lives .
on one recent trip , i met rasmata , a young mother who told me that thanks to the safety net of her savings group , she was managing to support her family despite her husband ’s emigration abroad , her father ’s recent death , and a lingering drought .
she was diversifying her income , managing her finances , and even adopting climate-smart farming techniques .
the best part was that she described herself as a “ hard-working , respectful , rigorous , and ambitious woman . ”
those are adjectives that women everywhere , regardless of their financial situation or education , deserve to ascribe to themselves .
if you are a prudent and cautious investor , contemplate that possibility for a moment .
stock values in the fossil-fuel industry – which are based on the assumption that companies will be able to extract and burn all known reserves – will plummet .
investing in these companies , it turns out , is extraordinarily risky .
as anyone who receives investment statements knows , “ past performance is no guarantee of future performance . ”
that reality implies another compelling case for divestment .
only in the late 1970s and 1980s did it become evident that the soviet system could not compete with market capitalism .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and the subsequent soviet collapse , that g2 world gave way to a g1 + n order in which all other countries ( n ) were unable to rival america as the sole global superpower .
the ensuing quarter-century was a period of liberal rules-based multilateralism .
democratic and market-based capitalism had seemingly triumphed in what francis fukuyama called “ the end of history . ”
the us broadly championed this order – the 2003 iraq war being a clear exception – and , like most countries , benefited enormously from globalization and the emergence of new complex value chains .
instead , after four years of falling real incomes , the government announced deeply unpopular pension reforms , which included an increase in the retirement age .
addressing russians ’ economic grievances will not be easy .
russia ’s economy is under severe strain as a result of the sanctions imposed by the west over crimea .
more important , russia ’s state-capitalist model has led to weak competition and declining incentives for private investment and entrepreneurship .
with few options for rallying public opinion , putin may well have decided that it is time to “ remind ” russians that they are under attack .
first , member states say they want to develop a common european foreign policy .
at maastricht in 1991 , they set up new institutions for doing so ; and at amsterdam last year , they ostensibly strengthened those institutions .
yet in practice there has been no detectable progress .
this is in stark contrast with other aspects of the european union agenda .
the target of economic and monetary union and a single currency , which was also adopted at maastricht in 1991 , is a bold , even revolutionary programme ; some critics say reckless ; but the fact is that the single currency will be a reality in just two months ’ time .
but broad international support will not be forthcoming if military operations are perceived as some form of western neo-imperialism .
this last point has been at the heart of the problems in iraq .
augmenting us and british troops with other " western " forces would not , particularly at this late stage , change the fundamental perception of that intervention , both in the arab world and beyond it .
only the explicit , up-front approval of a reformed un security council can provide the legitimacy and international support that military action - with the exception of clear self-defense - requires .
this is true for actions contemplated by individual nations , temporary alliances , or more permanent alliances such as nato .
this regional re-alignment need not be necessarily anti-western , but it surely will be if israel and/or the united states attack iran militarily .
meanwhile , civil war is raging in syria , accompanied by a humanitarian catastrophe .
to be sure , president bashar al-assad ’s regime will not survive , but it is determined to fight until the end .
syria ’s balkanization among the country ’s diverse ethnic and religious groups is a clearly predictable result .
indeed , a bosnia-type scenario can no longer be excluded , while the prospect of the syrian government ’s loss of control over its chemical weapons poses an immediate threat of military intervention by turkey , israel , or the us .
in newsrooms from serbia to south africa , taxpayer-generated funding is growing .
unfortunately , while this windfall might be putting more programming on the air , it is only deepening the industry ’s woes .
governments have played a major role in domestic media for decades , using regulation of broadcast frequencies and licensing requirements to shape the market .
yet , in recent years , governments have also stepped up their budgetary influence .
today , government budget allocations are among the leading sources of media revenue .
the next big step was the emergence of the concept of humanitarian intervention after the genocide in rwanda and the balkan wars in the 1990 ’s .
as a result , international law came to recognize the “ right of protection ” against governmental arbitrariness and states ’ crimes against their own people , even though enforcement remains quite uncertain .
finally , the same developments in politics and international law led to the creation of the international court of justice .
with its establishment , resulting from long and terrible experience , the basic idea of modernity – that the power of states and their rulers should be subject to the rule of higher law , thus placing individual rights above state sovereignty – has taken a great step forward .
this development was anything but accidental .
axelrod held tournaments among major game theorists and political scientists to identify the most effective approach in a repeated game of prisoner ’s dilemma .
the winner – the strategy most likely to produce a cooperative outcome – was anatol rapoport ’s tit-for-tat ( tft ) strategy .
according to the tft approach , a bilateral game should begin with cooperation : if the other player behaves cooperatively , so should you .
only if the other player defects – that is , begins to display non-cooperative behavior – should you do the same .
of course , when the other player is cooperating , it might be tempting to defect , in order to increase your own payoff and potentially even secure a windfall .
as for the threat from the right , anyone hoping for peace in the region and reduced tensions within india between religious communities is relieved by the defeat of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) .
the bjp ’s strategy of painting the congress as soft on terror and demonizing muslims as an existential threat to india badly misfired .
unfortunately , however , the economic trajectory that congress is plotting , though it may well boost growth in the short term , is ultimately on a collision course with both equity and sustainability .
despite rhetoric about “ inclusive growth , ” india ’s wealth gap has widened during the years of exceptionally rapid economic expansion .
the majority of the world ’s malnourished children live in india .
but it is fairly clear that even in the 1970s there was not enough empirical evidence in support of friedman ’s ideas to justify their growing dominance .
and , indeed , there can be no denying the fact that friedman ’s cure proved to be an inadequate response to the great recession – strongly suggesting that it would have fallen similarly short had it been tried during the great depression .
the dominance of friedman ’s ideas at the beginning of the great recession has less to do with the evidence supporting them than with the fact that the science of economics is all too often tainted by politics .
in this case , the contamination was so bad that policymakers were unwilling to go beyond friedman and apply keynesian and minskyite policies on a large enough scale to address the problems that the great recession presented .
admitting that the monetarist cure was inadequate would have required mainstream economists to swim against the neoliberal currents of our age .
berlin – ever since the global financial crisis erupted in september 2008 , the european union has been in turmoil .
on the one hand , the euro protected the eurozone , particularly germany ’s export economy , from speculative attacks and the chaos of currency volatility .
on the other hand , the second phase of the crisis mercilessly exposed the euro ’s achilles heel : the absence of economic or financial unification within the eurozone .
rising tensions within the eu have been the inevitable result .
germany ’s actions throughout the crisis have been plainly contradictory .
after all , the oppressive nature of the regime in khartoum is at the root of the many conflicts that have torn the country apart .
if the government in khartoum persists in undermining the reform process and derailing the referendum on self-determination promised for the south in january 2011 , a return to full-scale civil war , with calamitous consequences for the peoples of sudan and the entire region , is a real possibility .
the commitment of sudan ’s government to the cpa has always been equivocal .
indeed , since the civil war ’s end in 2005 , the sudan people ’s liberation army ( spla ) in the south has frequently had to confront militias that operate as government proxies .
moreover , sudanese security forces continue to arm arab tribes straddling the north-south border with the aim of destabilizing the mostly christian south .
( hydroelectric power generation emits no co2 , but there are only a few remaining places in the world where it can be expanded without major environmental or social costs . )
the second solution is to capture co2 emissions for storage underground .
but this technology , called carbon capture and sequestration ( ccs ) , is not yet proven on a large scale .
one approach is to capture the co2 at the power plant as the coal or gas is burned .
another is to capture it directly from the air using specially designed chemical processes .
in the post-crisis financial order , governments must take on the role of monitoring and regulating pay in financial firms ; otherwise , the perverse incentives that contributed to the current crisis could easily recur .
it is important to distinguish between two sources of concern about pay in financial firms .
one set of concerns arises from the perspective of shareholders .
figures recently released by new york ’s attorney general , andrew cuomo , indicate that nine large financial firms paid their employees aggregate compensation exceeding $ 600 billion in 2003-2008 – a period in which their aggregate market capitalization substantially declined .
such patterns may raise concerns among shareholders that pay structures are not well designed to serve their interests .
such manufactured even-handedness is tantamount to “ fake news . ”
it is time to call a spade a spade : the republican party is overwhelmingly responsible .
consider the issue of “ bump stocks , ” the gun modification that the perpetrator of the las vegas massacre used to be able to fire faster .
some republican senators have now drawn praise for indicating that they will support a ban on the device .
but when democratic senator diane feinstein proposed a similar ban in 2013 , republicans overwhelmingly opposed her .
by 2000 , that share had fallen to 22 % , and , by 2010 , to 11 % , with little more than 3 % living in outright destitution .
today ’s chile is very different from the chile of 20 years ago .
the 29 % of the population that have left poverty behind are now an incipient middle class with new ambitions and goals .
as a result , demands for more opportunities and better living conditions have grown louder .
chileans are clamoring for adequate housing , access to better health services , a safer environment , and access to higher education – the most important factor in social advancement .
clinton is the only person known to have launched her campaign twice .
( the first attempt , in iowa , where she talked to about eight people in closed meetings , did n’t work out very well . )
this impressive , remarkably intelligent woman just does n’t have the feel for politics that is demanded at the highest levels .
success in us presidential politics requires superb intuition , being quick on one ’s feet , and , above all , a compelling rationale for running .
true , clinton offers numerous programs that she would push as president ; but , to borrow from winston churchill , there is no theme to her pudding .
only a year ago , at the imf ’s annual meeting in washington , dc , senior staff were telling anyone who would listen that the whole european sovereign-debt panic was a tempest in a teapot .
using slick powerpoint presentations with titles like “ default in today ’s advanced economies : unnecessary , undesirable , and unlikely , ” the fund tried to convince investors that eurozone debt was solid as a rock .
even for greece , the imf argued , debt dynamics were not a serious concern , thanks to anticipated growth and reforms .
never mind the obvious flaw in the fund ’s logic , namely that countries such as greece and portugal face policy and implementation risks far more akin to emerging markets than to truly advanced economies such as germany and the united states .
as the situation deteriorated , one might have guessed that the imf would mark its beliefs to market , as it were , and adopt a more cautious tone .
another alternative , supported by a large and growing body of research in economics and psychology , is direct measurement of wellbeing or happiness .
surveys of reported levels of wellbeing are now available for many countries , and the idea of cutting to the chase by using this as the prosperity metric has strong advocates .
but this option has several drawbacks , including the fact that indicators of wellbeing change little over time .
happiness surveys in rich countries , for example , typically show a score of six or seven on a 0-10 scale .
one way to make such indicators more directly relevant to policy would be to track the ways people use their time and attach wellbeing measures to each .
if that is the metric , then , despite her achievements , thatcherism was a failure .
the shift toward finance that thatcher promoted heightened inequality and made the economy more volatile .
her “ right to buy ” policy triggered an upward spiral in house prices , which encouraged households to take on more and more debt .
the “ big bang ” of 1986 , which de-regulated financial services , made risky behavior in the city the norm .
these reforms sowed the seeds of the financial crisis of 2008 .
yes , the imf maintains an impressive analytical edge , owing to its talented and dedicated staff as well as its unique links to countries .
yes , it has made important strides in improving its understanding of the relationship between financial markets and the real economy .
and , yes , it has bravely taken the lead in shining more light on the economic impact of gender inequality and climate change .
but its forward-looking analyses have too often proved to be backward-looking , and its quantitative projections have consistently been subject to considerable revisions .
even more worryingly , the fund ’s policy recommendations – especially those pertaining to the advanced economies – have little impact ( to put it politely ) .
this is particularly necessary because the situation of women is one of the main benchmarks that the outside world , and particularly the west , uses to assess the arab world .
and , unfortunately , such assessments tend to focus on the supposed immobilism that derives from islamic norms , which obscures knowledge of the real changes that are taking place .
indeed , the predominant view of arab societies often stifles outsiders ’ ability to break free of their belief that islam confines all arab women in the same way , when in reality they experience very different conditions .
this prevents many from seeing , much less evaluating , the deep changes taking place in arab societies – and how women are driving those changes forward .
the west thus risks depriving itself of an important key to understanding the arab world today , and as it will be tomorrow .
in the lonely crowd , the american sociologist david riesman identified three broad cultural types : tradition-directed cultures that look to inherited rituals , morals , and values for guidance ; inner-directed cultures , in which people behave according to self-nourished values ; and other-directed cultures that react predominantly to external norms and peer influences .
riesman ’s framework has particular resonance in the arab world today , where rising literacy rates and rapid advances in communication technology have stirred a maelstrom of competing cultural narratives , with his three types competing to define the region ’s future .
ironically , it is the combination of increased literacy and modern technology that is fanning the flames of conflict between the two types of “ reformers ” – religious revivalists and western-oriented modernizers .
taking advantage of their ability to mass-produce and instantly disseminate ancient religious texts and western-originating literature , the two camps battle for the hearts and minds of otherwise traditional societies .
according to the lebanese publisher samar abou-zeid , however , religious books are among the most downloaded works of literature in the arab world .
until recently , there was little reason to ask such a question .
china ’s economy was growing at an astounding average annual rate of 10 % or higher for more than three decades .
china had overtaken japan as the world ’s second largest economy .
hundreds of millions of chinese had entered the middle class .
china ’s model of authoritarian efficiency seemed attractive to many other developing countries , particularly in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis , which began in the united states and thus seemed to discredit american-style liberal capitalism .
then the us established permanent normal trade relations with china and refused to brand its government a currency manipulator .
the reason this narrative is wrong is simple .
there are good reasons why the us adopted policies that encouraged poorer countries to grow rapidly through export-led industrialization .
in helping mexico , china , and other developing countries grow , the us is gaining richer trading partners .
furthermore , there is a strong case that us national security will be improved if , 50 years from now , schoolchildren around the world learn how america helped their countries prosper , rather than trying to keep them as poor as possible for as long as possible .
but it is an open question whether the still highly fragmented digital-payment sector will help customers more than the companies offering the payment solutions .
there is one more major problem with the arguments for a cashless society : most people , at least in the eurozone , do n’t want it .
according to an as-yet-unpublished european central bank survey of 65,000 eurozone residents , almost 80 % of all point-of-sale transactions are conducted in cash ; and , in terms of value , more than half of payments are made in cash .
as is often the case in europe , the differences among member states are pronounced : the share of cash transactions ranges from 42 % in finland to 92 % in malta .
but , overall , the public ’s commitment to cash remains strong – and is becoming stronger .
tel aviv – the crisis in the sinai peninsula seems to have been dwarfed by sunday ’s drama in cairo .
but egyptian president mohamed morsi ’s civilian coup , in which he dismissed general mohamed hussein tantawi , the leader of the army ’s supreme command , has not diminished the importance of the trouble there .
earlier this month , jihadi terrorists ambushed an egyptian military base in sinai , killing 16 egyptian soldiers .
they then hijacked two armored personnel carriers and sped toward the frontier with israel .
one vehicle failed to break through the border crossing ; the other penetrated israeli territory , before being stopped by the israel defense forces ( idf ) .
but as countries that largely rely on active diplomacy and soft power , they have everything to lose from a prolonged and escalating geopolitical conflict in which they would come under pressure to choose sides .
to defend their interests , they must ensure that global trade is subject to objective dispute-settlement mechanisms .
a commitment to multilateralism is not an endorsement of the status quo .
cptpp and ceta member states recognize that the global trading system has problems , including incomplete or outdated rules that fail to account for issues such as subsidies to soes .
but they also know that bilateralism – small countries trying to negotiate on equal terms with superpowers – is not an option .
the grassroots assessment of progress against these indicators is intended to complement the government-led reporting mechanism .
finally , some african “ sdg 16 champions ” are making the goal central to national planning , budgeting , and reporting .
in kenya , all public-sector officials in sdg 16-related ministries , departments , and agencies are obliged to sign performance contracts with the central government , in which they identify sdg 16 targets and indicators relevant to their mandate and explain how these are being integrated in policy and development plans .
ghana and benin , meanwhile , emphasize budget spending that has a high sdg 16 impact , and ghana ’s government also publicly discloses how closely its financial priorities are aligned with its stated commitments under this goal .
moreover , several countries have found innovative ways to ensure that governments use new national sdg 16 data in their day-to-day decision-making .
on the global level , it is difficult to argue that inequality is one of the world ’s major political-economic problems .
it is hard , at least for me , to envision alternative political arrangements or economic policies over the past fifty years that would have transferred any significant portion of the wealth of today ’s rich nations to today ’s poor nations .
i can easily envision alternatives , such as communist victories in post-world war ii elections in italy and france that would have impoverished nations now in the rich north .
i can also envision alternatives that would have enriched poor nations : deng xiaoping becoming china ’s leader in 1956 rather than 1976 would have done the job there .
but alternatives that would have made the south richer at the price of reducing the wealth of the north would require a wholesale revolution in human psychology .
repayment on griesa ’s terms would devastate argentina ’s economy .
nml capital and the other vultures comprise just 1 % of the creditors , but would receive a total of $ 1.5 billion .
other holdouts ( 6.6 % of total creditors ) would receive $ 15 billion .
and , because the debt restructuring stipulated that all of the creditors who accepted it could demand the same terms as holdouts receive , argentina might be on the hook for $ 140 billion more .
every argentine might thus owe more than $ 3,500 – more than one-third of average annual per capita income .
it will be essential , after bali , to reflect seriously on the next phase for the wto and its role in the international trading system .
the major international financial institutions – the international monetary fund , the world bank , the european bank for reconstruction and development , and the regional development banks – are having to work hard to make themselves fit for the twenty-first century .
the authority of the united nations has frayed .
until we reverse the trend of declining multilateralism , governments ’ ability to respond to global challenges will not improve .
business can moan and the media can carp , but the answer to many of the world ’s great problems is more – or at least better – government , not less .
economists and moralists have been united in believing that you should actually spend less than you earn – in order to “ save ” for the proverbial rainy day or for old age .
getting into debt was long associated with profligacy or fecklessness .
and , if a person became indebted , it was a point of honor to repay the obligation when it fell due , by selling assets , reducing consumption , working harder , or some combination of the three .
indeed , it was often more than a point of honor : failure to repay debt on time landed the debtor in prison .
the same attitude governed institutional debt .
more broadly , the emblematic defeat of marxism in 1989 allowed asian countries , including china and india , to pursue capitalist policies overtly .
although china ’s economic renaissance had already begun under deng xiaoping , the chinese communist party , after 1989 , was able publicly to subordinate ideology to wealth creation .
that example , in turn , had a constructive influence on surviving communist parties in asia and beyond .
geopolitically , the post-1989 gains extended far beyond the west .
the soviet union ’s sudden collapse was a strategic boon to asia , eliminating a menacing empire and opening the way for china rapidly to pursue its interests globally .
similarly , rather than condemning the adoption of terrorist tactics by the taliban in afghanistan , boko haram in nigeria , and al-shabaab in somalia , and the destruction of sufi shrines in mali by ansar dine , a radical islamist sect , muslim leaders have remained largely silent .
while none of these groups represents a majority point of view , they do exert significant influence and probably believe that they are acting in the interest of the majority .
developments following the arab spring might provide some indication of the prospects for religious tolerance .
in egypt , with its 10 % coptic orthodox christian minority , the muslim brotherhood ’s mohamed morsi won the presidency in a free and fair election , after which morsi resigned from the party , saying that this would allow him to represent all egyptians more effectively , and promised that he would respect minority rights .
yet subsequent actions designed to give him unprecedented executive power raise concerns about these early positive steps .
this group will unite with forces of democratization both at home and abroad to establish a truly democratic system .
fourth , reversal of the verdict on june 4th is an historical inevitability , as well as the wish of most of china ’s people .
june 4th weighs on the spirits of every chinese patriot ; almost every chinese person knows that official reevaluation is just a matter of time .
indeed , the party 's top leadership has been divided about the event ever since it occurred .
today , many of those responsible for the decision to crack down - notably deng xiaoping and others of the party elders – have died .
mattarella ’s detractors argue that he overstepped his authority and has allowed financial markets to veto the selection of a minister by a popularly elected government .
by joining the euro , italy surrendered monetary sovereignty to an external , independent decision-maker , the european central bank .
it also undertook specific commitments with respect to the conduct of its fiscal policy , though these constraints are not as “ hard ” as those framing monetary policy .
these obligations place real limits on the italian authorities ’ macroeconomic policy choices .
in particular , the absence of a domestic currency means italians can not choose their own inflation target or devalue their currency vis-à-vis foreign currencies .
once again , we see how misplaced western national priorities can bring ruin on a non-western nation .
in any contest of ideas , the extreme will usually triumph over the moderate .
in pakistan , the extremist now wears islamic garb , and stands for the creator , for faith , and for a theocratic order .
what , by contrast , might a pakistani liberal stand for ? indeed , who in pakistan is calling for a liberal , democratic country ?
in the dark , congested alleys of lahore , karachi , peshawar , or quetta , the yearning is not for democratic liberalism , but for the believers to unite behind the one true faith .
there are strong grounds for believing that they should .
japan has relatively strict laws protecting animals ’ welfare .
for example , most mammals must be slaughtered by a method that minimizes their pain and distress as much as possible .
these laws are similar to regulations implemented by most abattoirs in the industrialized world , which require that animals be stunned – rendered unconscious with gas and insensitive to pain – when they have their throats cut and are “ bled out . ”
there are of course circumstances where the stunning fails and animals are killed while fully conscious ; but when stunning works properly , it does reduce the animals ’ suffering .
cambridge – president donald trump ’s critics have consistently underestimated his political communication skills , perhaps because he is so different from predecessors such as franklin d. roosevelt and ronald reagan .
both fdr and reagan , after all , were known as “ great communicators . ”
although large segments of the american population hated them , fdr and reagan addressed the american people as a whole and tried to appeal to the center .
trump , by contrast , has appealed primarily to the minority that elected him .
his inaugural address sounded like a campaign speech ; and , after taking office , a series of false statements and provocative executive orders has undercut his credibility with the center but reinforced it with his base .
far more important to the achievement of price stability has been the advent of the modern independent central bank , a device that has helped dramatically reduce inflation levels worldwide .
yes , a few places , such as venezuela , still have triple-digit price growth , but they are now rarities .
it is very likely that if , instead of joining the euro , italy and spain had simply granted their central banks more autonomy , they , too , would have low inflation today .
greece is admittedly a less obvious case ; but , considering that many poor african countries have been able to keep inflation well within single digits , one can presume that greece would have managed as well .
indeed , if southern european countries had kept their own currencies , they might never have dug as big a debt hole , and would have had the option of partial default through inflation .
cohn ’s sin was to let it be known publicly that he almost resigned following the violence last month in charlottesville , va. , when trump equated white supremacist and neo-nazi demonstrators , many of them armed , with those who opposed them .
actually , one can have some sympathy for a president with an aide who wants to have it both ways , as cohn did – letting his apparent anguish be known without acting on it .
but there can be problems when a president chooses to disregard his chief economic adviser .
cohn has been seen as one of the administration ’s more moderate voices , and he has wanted to succeed janet yellen as chair of the us federal reserve .
speculation about the possibility of a “ new trump ” peaked in early september , when the president suddenly cut a deal with democratic congressional leaders .
but the risks are as real as the potential rewards .
resource industries are persistent sources of corruption , conflict , and degradation .
mineral and hydrocarbon deposits are often located in less-developed countries that suffer from pre-existing governance constraints , political instability , and major developmental and environmental challenges .
transparency – full disclosure of everything from contracts to management of revenues and environmental commitments – is crucial for realizing the sector ’s economic potential , and avoiding conflict and collapse .
on may 17 , the advocacy organization oxfam america sued the us securities and exchange commission to issue a final rule implementing section 1504 of the 2010 dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act .
links to west africa are close and go back over the last century , with almost 50,000 indians or people of indian origin living in the region .
indeed , scores of people fly between accra , lagos , freetown , monrovia , or abidjan and new delhi , mumbai , calcutta , or chennai on a daily basis , transiting through the middle east or europe .
while exit controls are in place in all of the international airports in the affected regions , the virus ’s incubation period ( which averages eight days in the current outbreak but can be up to 21 days ) means that someone with no symptoms from a recent infection could make the trip to india without triggering alarms .
recent personal experience at new delhi airport indicated that nominal arrival checks , as the government requires , were loosely enforced , with a number of passengers exiting the terminal holding completed ebola information cards that should have been handed to immigration officials .
it seems unlikely that india ’s government will be able to keep tabs on all of the arrivals from west africa .
new york – british prime minister david cameron ’s government has announced some of the most draconian public-sector cuts any developed country government has ever attempted .
indeed , his minister of education recently declared that funding for britain ’s universities would be slashed by as much as 40 % .
but the most shocking aspect of the move is that arts and humanities departments will be targeted more aggressively than science and engineering , which are supposedly better for business .
the war against the arts and humanities is nothing new – though this is the first time that the fight has migrated so directly to britain .
ronald reagan pioneered a wave of policy and propaganda in the united states in the 1980 ’s that demonized the national endowment for the arts .
when i visited tripoli in march 2010 for a “ national reconciliation ” conference , the conflicting statements given by saif al-islam and security officials surprised me .
the head of internal security forces , colonel al-tuhami khaled , another principal suspect in the crimes currently being committed against libyans , refused to call the process a “ reconciliation . ”
for him , it was “ repentance from heresy . ”
given the recent wave of uprisings , it is more evident than ever that any “ reform ” initiatives undertaken in the arab world previously were aimed only at sustaining repressive dictatorships and escaping punishment for criminal abuse of power .
the reform “ debate ” within these regimes boiled down to a struggle between different branches of the security-military apparatus over the best way to preserve the status quo .
if credit expands too rapidly , the fed can raise the interest rate that it pays on deposits .
sufficiently high rates will induce commercial banks to prefer the fed ’s combination of liquidity , safety , and yield to expanding the quantity of private lending .
that , at any rate , is the theory ; no one knows how it would work in practice .
how high would the fed – or the ecb , for that matter – have to raise the interest rate on deposits to prevent excessive growth in bank lending ?
what if that interest rate had to be 4 % or 6 % or even 8 % ?
policymakers at nanjing promised to address this problem .
they tasked the g-20 with developing a set of indicators that would signal when any country , including the us and china , was at risk of a crisis .
they called for a process to ensure that when the warning lights flashed yellow , the country in question would be compelled to correct its policies .
unfortunately , such early warning indicators are better at reflecting the last crisis than they are at preventing the next one .
the nature of financial risk is constantly changing in ways that are difficult to predict using backward-looking indicators like those being devised by the g-20 .
moreover , obama has sought to suppress hundreds of photographs depicting sexual assault in us-run prisons , and has done nothing to roll back the patriot act .
why should obama , a constitutional scholar , be backtracking this way ?
first , he does not dare appear to be “ soft on terror . ”
second , perhaps he needs to be able to try the guantánamo detainees in a rigged setting , or even keep them from trial forever : lawyers claim that torture , including sexual torture , was so endemic in the cia and the military that obama could be holding scores , if not hundreds , of prisoners whose bodies are crime scenes .
according to wells dixon , a lawyer at the center for constitutional rights who represents some of the detainees , the obama administration can not risk calling the torture practices crimes , so it calls them “ classified sources and methods ” that can not be revealed in court .
if the authorities – specifically the federal reserve and the fdic – determine that this is not possible , they have the legal power to force the banks to change how they operate , including by reducing their scale and scope .
but the current reality is that no megabank could go bankrupt without causing another “ lehman moment ” – that is , the kind of global panic that resulted in the days after lehman brothers failed in september 2008 .
in particular , experts like hoenig who have thought about the cross-border dimensions of bankruptcy emphasize that it simply would not work for a corporation the size of jpmorgan chase ( $ 3.7 trillion in assets ) , bank of america ( $ 3 trillion ) , or citigroup ( $ 2.7 trillion ) .
“ panic is about panic , ” hoenig says , “ and people and nations generally protect themselves and their wealth ahead of others .
moreover , there are no international bankruptcy laws to govern such matters and prevent the grabbing of assets . ”
paris – the central paradox of french politics was confirmed once again on march 27 .
in a nationwide vote to select local authorities ( the so called conseiller général ) , the far-right national front gained 11 % of the votes cast , but secured only 0.1 % of the seats .
this discrepancy between the national front ’s popular strength and its actual representation has been a permanent feature of french politics since jean-marie le pen established the party 40 years ago .
but le pen was replaced in january by his no less charismatic daughter , marine .
and , with that change , the fate of the front may be changing , too .
with technical support like this , indonesia ’s government is creating an affordable and sustainable national health-care system that will be fully financed with domestic resources by 2019 .
i believe that the global fund is one of the smartest investments that we can make – as many governments have understood from the outset .
the united states has been the global fund ’s largest supporter , but many others have done their part .
for example , australia has provided us $ 410 million to the global fund since 2002 , an amount that has enabled nearly 200,000 people to receive lifesaving hiv treatment , 80,000 people to receive tb treatment , seven million people to be cured of malaria , and 14 million bed nets to be delivered to families in need .
the global fund has brightened the futures of hundreds of thousands of children across africa and asia – a heroic achievement that should make donor countries ’ citizens proud .
new york – everyone – from elected officials and bureaucrats to voters and taxpayers – can learn from the world ’s largest charitable foundation about effective development spending .
and these lessons are particularly relevant at a time when 56 % of europeans believe their governments should focus solely on domestic issues and let recipient countries deal with problems as best they can ( opposition to aid is even higher in france , poland , italy , hungary , and greece ) .
the united kingdom ’s largest-circulation sunday newspaper recently launched a petition calling for an end to ring-fenced aid spending ( worth 0.7 % of national income ) .
prior to his election victory , us president donald trump railed against “ sending foreign aid to countries that hate us , ” reflecting a widespread belief that aid needs to be cut .
the united states allocates less than 1 % of the federal budget to aid , but the average american believes this figure to be thirty-one-times higher .
but the first fell prey to a long us occupation , and the second currently faces a us-led oil-export embargo designed to throttle it financially .
as a result , america ’s efforts to give international effect to its new iran sanctions act constitute a double whammy for india .
first , it threatens to sabotage india ’s energy-import diversification strategy by making it overly dependent on the islamist-bankrolling oil monarchies – including saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , and qatar – which have managed to ride out the arab spring .
second , further isolation of iran will make it very difficult for india to play a more active role in afghanistan at a time when the us is hastening its military disengagement there and seeking to cut a deal with the taliban .
india , one of the largest aid donors to afghanistan , has no contiguous corridor to that country and must rely on iran for access .
the key obstacle to this proposal is the requirement of congressional approval to increase america ’s quota share .
this opens the possibility that the us ’s voting power could temporarily fall below the 15 % threshold needed to veto decisions that require the support of 85 % of imf members ’ votes .
in order to secure us support , the board of governors could commit not to consider any draft decision requiring 85 % backing without america ’s consent .
this guarantee could be included in the resolution dividing the reform package into two parts .
it would remain valid until the us was in a position to increase its quota and recover its voting share .
but , almost six months into the north african upheavals , the number of arrivals on the southern island of lampedusa has reached roughly 30,000 .
by comparison , sweden , with one-sixth the population of italy , accepted the same number of asylum-seekers in 2009 .
italian officials privately confirm that the current figures are not unmanageable .
the problem for italian officials , as for the other governments concerned by the recent migration flows , is the pressure of right-wing populist parties , which no longer need to be on the defensive .
the case for openness , inclusion , and diversity in european societies has become much harder to make .
while this certainly impedes long-term economic growth and causes great structural problems , it also means that the state reacts extremely counter-cyclically and stabilizes the economy to a great extent , which benefits the entire world .
the german state recorded a budget deficit of just 0.1 % of gdp in 2008 , which , according to a recent oecd forecast , will soar to 4.5 % of gdp in 2009 .
thus , the economic stimulus provided by the german state budget will amount to 4.4 % of gdp in 2009 .
in the united states , the budget deficit in 2008 stood at 5.8 % of gdp , and , according to the same oecd forecast , will amount to 10.2 % of gdp in 2009 , which translates into exactly the same economic stimulus as in germany , 4.4 % of gdp .
in addition , germany has much more inner stability than the us , because it does not have the problem of heavily indebted households that are now restricted in their borrowing .
but catchy ideas die hard , and russia has moved to cement the current concept of the brics into an irreversible reality .
the ossification of the brics into a de facto global institution move forward dramatically in june , when the four countries ’ leaders met ( in russia , of course ) for the first “ bric summit . ”
that meeting produced a notable broadside against the united states , as each member declared its desire to unseat the dollar as the global reserve currency .
a few months earlier , the four were moved to issue a joint communiqué ahead of the g-20 summit in april noting their shared determination to change the rules of the global economic system .
in the private sector , bric index funds have proliferated , though goldman sachs has radically hedged its own bric bet by introducing a second term – the “ next 11 , ” or n-11 – to the debate .
advocating supply-side economics to the white working class , he convinced millions that “ less government , ” which meant cutting federal programs , including education – would bring “ morning in america . ”
with his well-rehearsed sunny disposition , reagan expertly played his role as president , but with a decidedly hollywood flair .
his strategic defense initiative , intended to end the nuclear-deterrence strategy known as “ mutual assured destruction , ” was actually nicknamed “ star wars . ”
reagan ’s enduring status as a republican icon has much to do with his ability to dole out cowboy cruelty with movie-star charm , though luck also played a role .
after all , victory in the cold war was aided substantially by mikhail gorbachev , whose effort to reform the soviet union hastened its collapse .
warsaw – had the august 1991 putsch against mikhail gorbachev not failed , the riots and death recently seen in xinjiang could have been taking place in russia .
instead of hearing about a crackdown in urumqi , xinjiang ’s capital , we might be reading about hundreds killed on the streets of almaty , and columnists would be making comparisons to the bloody crushing of ukrainian independence demonstrations in lvov the previous year .
as with china today , there would have been some feeble international condemnation , and some speculation about possible links between kazakh militants and exile groups , or islamic fundamentalists .
experts would remind us that kazakhstan had never been a country , and that ukrainian claims to independence are historically dubious .
substitute xinjiang for kazakhstan and tibet for ukraine and you get the picture .
so why did the imf flip ?
the answer is obvious : china mounted a full-court press to change minds .
in august , the currency ’s exchange-rate regime was loosened slightly .
renminbi-denominated government bonds were issued in london , and plans were laid to create new trading platforms for the currency in several european financial centers .
and chinese policymakers made it abundantly clear how unhappy they would be with a negative decision .
but foreign import barriers and exports subsidies are not the reason for the us trade deficit .
the real reason is that americans are spending more than they produce .
the overall trade deficit is the result of the saving and investment decisions of us households and businesses .
the policies of foreign governments affect only how that deficit is divided among america ’s trading partners .
the reason why americans ’ saving and investment decisions drive the overall trade deficit is straightforward : if a country saves more of total output than it invests in business equipment and structures , it has extra output to sell to the rest of the world .
many modi supporters claim that the demonetization policy ’s problems are a result of inept implementation .
but the truth is that its design was fundamentally flawed .
there was no “ policy skeleton , ” no cost-benefit analysis , and no evidence that alternative policy options were considered .
judging by the blizzard of policy tweaks since the announcement , it seems clear that no impact study was carried out .
yet , rather than recognize the mounting risks of the non-transparent policy environment he has created , modi has been discussing going even further , moving india to an entirely “ cashless society . ”
washington , dc – terrorism on the scale witnessed in paris last month is nothing new in africa .
in nigeria , cameroon , chad , and niger , the extremist group boko haram – famous for its kidnapping of 276 school girls in 2014 – has inflicted thousands of casualties with suicide bombings and assaults on civilians .
in kenya , the somali group al-shabaab has carried out two major attacks , on nairobi ’s westgate shopping mall in 2013 and on garissa university in 2015 , as well as many smaller acts of terror .
meanwhile in tunisia , the islamic state has targeted tourists – orchestrating attacks on a museum and a beach resort .
and in mali , shortly after the attacks in paris , gunmen belonging to an al qaeda affiliate stormed the radisson blu hotel in bamako , killing 22 people .
that is no longer true of the thousands of princes that they produced .
as the older generation dies off , the new generation has fallen to fighting in front of the customers .
indeed , with the ratio of royals to commoners now at one to a thousand ( compared to one to five million in the united kingdom ) , the challenge of managing princely privileges , salaries , and demand for jobs has never been more intense .
royal perks include lifetime sinecures and domination of the civil service , which enable the princes to award contracts and receive commissions on top of their salaries .
so the saudi regime is divided , its legitimacy is questioned , and sectarian tensions are growing .
london – julius nyerere , the first president of tanzania , once asked his country ’s creditors a blunt question : “ must we starve our children to pay our debts ? ”
that was in 1986 , before the public campaigns and initiatives that removed much of africa ’s crushing and unpayable debt burden .
but nyerere ’s question still hangs like a dark cloud over somalia .
over the last year , an unprecedented humanitarian effort has pulled somalia back from the brink of famine .
as the worst drought in living memory destroyed harvests and decimated livestock , almost $ 1 billion was mobilized in emergency aid for nutrition , health , and clean water provision .
brazil and other countries that complained about “ hot money ” inflows and “ currency wars , ” have now suddenly gotten what they wished for : a likely early end of the fed ’s qe .
the consequences – sharp capital-flow reversals that are now hitting all risky emerging-market assets – have not been pretty .
whether the correction in risky assets is temporary or the start of a bear market will depend on several factors .
one is whether the fed will truly exit from qe as quickly as it signaled .
there is a strong likelihood that weaker us growth and lower inflation will force it to slow the pace of its withdrawal of liquidity support .
berkeley – since the end of 2014 , we have been advocating a model of us governance based on the tenth amendment of the us constitution , which states that , “ the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . ”
increasingly , california has been exercising these constitutional rights .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
europe is slipping back into recession just when recovery in the united states is finally getting some traction . that has undermined the case for fiscal consolidation , which is so heavily favored in europe .
yet i took away a different conclusion from davos .
i moderated a session on “ the new context in east asia , ” addressed by a panel of senior representatives from thailand , south korea , malaysia , singapore , and japan .
with the exception of the japanese participant , all had first-hand experience with the devastating asian financial crisis of the late 1990 ’s .
i could n't resist the temptation to draw asia into the debate between europe and the us .
great scientific minds have learned over the course of many decades to “ read ” the earth ’s history , in order to understand how the climate system works .
they have deployed brilliant physics , biology , and instrumentation ( such as satellites reading detailed features of the earth ’s systems ) in order to advance our understanding .
and the message is clear : large-scale use of oil , coal , and gas is threatening the biology and chemistry of the planet .
we are fueling dangerous changes in earth ’s climate and ocean chemistry , giving rise to extreme storms , droughts , and other hazards that will damage the food supply and the quality of life of the planet .
the ipcc and the climate scientists are telling us a crucial message .
some integration advocates see a united europe as a strong partner of the us .
others are motivated by a desire to set up a rival power center , however unrealistic this appears to be .
some commentators have begun pointing to the different views of the us and europe on the role of international law , as opposed to the use of force , in resolving disputes .
because europe is militarily insignificant , they argue , it is not surprising that europeans emphasize diplomacy , rather than military might , to resolve disputes .
on the other hand , no one should be surprised that americans chafe at constraints on their ability to take advantage of us military hegemony .
moscow – the crisis in georgia last august tested europe ’s security system , and the system failed to fulfill its core task of ensuring common security for the continent as a whole .
as a result , europe must re-examine its current security arrangements , analyze what happened , and take this analysis into account in reforming those arrangements .
even before the georgia crisis , russia already saw a need to revisit the mechanisms of european security , including its international and regional institutions and their functions .
we suggested a new , legally binding treaty system of mutual security guarantees to ensure equal security throughout europe .
the european union believes that the russian initiative is well grounded and has shown interest in launching such a project .
princeton – should rallies by neo-nazis and white supremacists be met with violence ?
that question was raised by the tragic events in charlottesville , virginia , on august 12 .
white supremacists held a rally to protest the planned removal from a public park of a statue of robert e. lee , the leader of the confederate army during the civil war .
a counter-protest was organized , and street fighting broke out .
a woman , heather heyer , was killed and 19 people injured when james fields , a white nationalist , drove his car at high speed into a crowd of counter-protesters .
and wen has indicated that village elections might be extended to the next highest government level – township administrations – over the next few years .
china 's modest experiments with local elections have been supplemented by exercises in “ deliberative democracy . ”
these take the form of high-tech town hall meetings .
chinese officials hired stanford university professor james fishkin to draft a representative sample of citizens from zeguo for an assembly using keypad polling devices and handheld computers to decide how the city should spend a $ 6 million public-works budget .
the zeguo exercise was considered hugely successful , and has been replicated elsewhere in china .
european regulators have already introduced sophisticated monitoring and surveillance programs , blocked market access to countries with a record of illegal fishing , penalized european rogue operators , and helped support “ yellow or red carded ” countries reform their fisheries laws .
the eu , japan , and the us would be even more effective if they aligned their policies to prevent criminals from accessing their markets and enabled legitimate operators to benefit from a “ supercharged ” level of access .
working together could enable the use of affordable , sophisticated technology for seafood traceability – data and intelligence gathering that helps pinpoint exactly where seafood comes from , and when and by whom it was caught .
such efforts – for example , the electronic documentation scheme for the atlantic bluefin tuna catch – represent one of the most effective tools to eliminate illicit fishing .
eliminating rogue fishing will help replenish marine life and secure food and livelihoods for billions of people .
but the urban poor , faced with bad housing , limited infrastructure , and meager services , are vulnerable to epidemics , malnutrition-based childhood diseases , hiv/aids , malaria , tuberculosis , and mental disorders .
they are also likely to be hardest hit by natural disasters , such as the floods and mudslides that devastated parts of rio de janeiro in january .
a second generic feature of emerging-market cities is that dense concentrations of poverty help create fragile environments that spawn civil disorders , resulting in death and injuries .
but a recent symposium at oxford university concluded that emerging-market cities could improve and maintain urban health by capturing the inherent advantages of concentration , coordinating health policies and programs , adopting successful innovations , reforming health education and training , and developing improved planning processes .
indeed , many potential solutions stem from opportunities for innovation created by the physical concentration of people and economic activity .
this was followed by the june 2001 court decision to set a date for trial , making it possible at last to present the evidence against these individuals .
the courts ' actions represent guatemala 's first effort to bring high military officials to trial .
regrettably , the trial has been delayed indefinitely because the defendants ' lawyers appealed the case .
our successes in the matter of myrna mack are notable , but achieving them has proved difficult : the police investigator was assassinated ; judges have been threatened ; and witnesses have fled into exile .
i have been harassed and campaigns to discredit me organized .
proponents of geoengineering are right about one thing : we are facing a climate emergency that demands radical and urgent action .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) made that starkly apparent in october 2018 , and reinforced the point last month , with its report on climate change and land .
some major economies – including canada , ireland , the united kingdom – as well as regions and cities have now officially recognized the scale of the crisis .
the question is whether this will translate into a commitment to take the necessary action .
that certainly did not happen at last year ’s un climate change conference in katowice , poland .
meanwhile , germany , the european power with the closest historical and cultural relationship with russia , is at the end of a political cycle .
it is both dangerous and unfair to underestimate german chancellor angela merkel , but she no longer has the clout or the energy to lead europe in its dealings with the outside world , nor to rally europeans themselves .
with the uk and germany currently incapable of playing a major diplomatic role , and italy , spain , and poland in no position to be principal actors , the conclusion is quite simple : partly by default , and partly because of the sheer energy and imagination of its young president , this is france ’s moment .
finally , macron ’s attempt to reset relations with russia is perfectly in tune with france ’s gaullist tradition .
mediating between different systems , and looking beyond the current incarnation of other countries , was charles de gaulle ’s natural instinct .
they understood that democratic countries would need the space to conduct independent monetary and fiscal policies .
so they contemplated only a “ thin ” globalization , with capital flows restricted largely to long-term lending and borrowing .
john maynard keynes , who wrote the rules along with harry dexter white , viewed capital controls not as a temporary expedient but as a permanent feature of the global economy .
the bretton woods regime collapsed in the 1970 ’s as a result of the inability or unwillingness – it is not entirely clear which – of leading governments to manage the growing tide of capital flows .
the third path identified by the trilemma is to do away with national sovereignty altogether .
but if that makes traditional arms-control treaties impossible to verify , it may still be possible to set limits on certain types of civilian targets ( rather than weapons ) and negotiate rough rules of the road that limit conflict .
in any event , strategic stability in cyberspace will be difficult to maintain .
because technological innovation there is faster than in the nuclear realm , cyberwarfare is characterized by a heightened reciprocal fear of surprise .
over time , however , better attribution forensics may enhance the role of punishment ; and better defenses through encryption or machine learning may increase the role of prevention and denial .
moreover , as states and organizations come to understand better the limitations and uncertainties of cyberattacks and the growing importance of internet entanglement to their economic wellbeing , cost-benefit calculations of the utility of cyberwarfare may change .
likewise , the decision to recognize kosovo ’s independence came only after russia made clear that it would veto the deal proposed by the un secretary general ’s special envoy , former finnish president martii ahtisaari .
even then we agreed to a further four months of eu-us-russia negotiations in order to ensure that no stone was left unturned in the search for a mutually acceptable compromise .
by contrast , in georgia , russia moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so .
russia must now ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and long-term economic prosperity .
the conflict in georgia has been followed by a sharp decline in investor confidence .
more broadly , such a strategy could also start to close the deepening transatlantic divide that trump ’s presidency has opened up .
the fracturing of the west is a welcome development in the eyes of russian president vladimir putin and illiberal regimes around the world .
authoritarians and populists would like nothing more than to sow chaos and loss of confidence in the postwar rules-based international order .
the democracies that built that order embody values that are antithetical to authoritarians ’ interests .
finally , trump ’s jcpoa decision demonstrates , once again , that europe relies far too much on the us for its security and prosperity .
knowledge-based organizations are forming a wide range of alliances with the media and play an important role in influencing public opinion as well as diplomacy .
a number of international negotiations on issues such as bio-safety and organic pollutants benefit from such alliances .
knowledge-based institutions are also better equipped to use the expanding global information infrastructure to influence diplomacy .
modern international diplomacy is more and more dependent on groups that make rules , set standards , and collect technical data .
in the environmental field , new institutions are emerging that focus their work on harmonizing criteria and indicators , especially for use in programs that certify sustainable use of resources as in the case of forests and fisheries .
nor was the strong showing by populist parties in this month ’s election in italy , where the anti-immigration league party and the anti-establishment five star movement together secured some 50 % of the vote .
even germany has , to some extent , fallen victim to populist forces .
to be sure , a new grand coalition government – comprising chancellor angela merkel ’s christian democratic union , its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , and the social democratic party – has been formed .
but it took more than five months for the parties to agree , and the largest opposition party is now the far-right alternative for germany .
in a country that seemed to have been vaccinated against populism by its nazi history , this is a particularly distressing development .
likewise , restrictions and ambiguities continue to plague the institutional arrangements sought by the framers of the country ’s political and electoral reforms .
reelection is permitted only for candidates nominated by the same party for which they originally ran , and the enabling legislation for independent candidates , ballot initiatives , and referenda remains unclear .
most important , the government appears to be backtracking on a commitment to allow a binding referendum on the opening of the oil sector and other “ transcendent ” issues .
its reluctance is understandable , because voters are evenly divided on the issue , and no one will invest a cent in mexican oil or gas if the recently approved constitutional amendment on pemex can be overturned in 2015 , as the opposition claims will happen .
but curtailing democracy in order to modernize the energy sector is not a good idea .
regardless of the form it took , it began to receive some heavy blows a few years ago ( analogous to the crises that hit exchange-rate targets in the 1990 ’s ) .
perhaps the biggest setback hit in september 2008 , when it became clear that central banks that had been relying on it had not paid enough attention to asset-price bubbles .
central bankers had told themselves that they were giving asset markets all of the attention that they deserved , by specifying that housing prices and equity prices could be taken into account to the extent that they implied information regarding goods inflation .
but this escape clause proved insufficient : when the global financial crisis hit ( suggesting , at least in retrospect , that monetary policy had been too loose from 2003 to 2006 ) , it was neither preceded nor followed by an upsurge in inflation .
that the boom-bust cycle could occur without inflation should not have come as a surprise .
employers can avoid the mandate by reducing an employee ’s workweek to less than 30 hours ( which the law defines as full-time employment ) .
but even for full-time employees , firms can opt to pay a relatively small fine rather than provide insurance .
that fine is $ 2,000 per employee , much less than the current average premium of $ 16,000 for employer-provided family policies .
not providing insurance and paying the fine is a particularly attractive option for a firm if its employees have incomes that entitle them to the government subsidies ( which are now available to anyone whose income is below four times the poverty level ) .
rather than incur the cost of the premium for an approved policy , a smart employer can pay the fine for not providing insurance and increase employees ’ pay by enough so that they have more spendable cash after purchasing the subsidized insurance policy .
the two cabinet ministers who resigned over the affair , robin cook and clare short , want their own revenge and thus continue to attack blair for his `` lies . ''
so far , blair has proven his resilience to such charges .
indeed , he has gone on the counter-attack , notably against the bbc , which had not exactly supported the war with enthusiasm .
but does the uncertainty now circling blair like a vulture now smell the appetizingly foul scent of a lie ?
or is it more a question of a prime minister losing the trust of his people , including some his erstwhile friends and allies ?
increasingly obsessed at the prospect of its own citizens and practices coming under international scrutiny , america has over the past few years contributed to the general erosion of the un human rights monitoring system .
it adamantly opposed several important and promising new human rights initiatives , notably the international criminal court ( icc ) , and a new anti-torture mechanism .
on the anti-torture protocol , the us sought to derail the creation of a universal system of visits to places of detention , under an optional protocol to the convention against torture .
here america found itself allied with some strange bedfellows that it normally rebukes as chronic human rights violators - cuba , china , iran , libya , sudan or zimbabwe .
yet , without us support , the initiative was overwhelmingly endorsed in late july by the un 's economic and social council .
nor will it be enough to recall the historic benefits of engagement and britain 's distinguished centuries-old role in ensuring that no country ever gained sole mastery of europe .
what needs to be said is this : britain is at its best when it sees itself as a leader in europe .
just as britain once led europe in fighting fascism , supporting democratic aspirations , and charting the continent 's response to the global recession of 2008 , it should be inside europe leading from the front ranks .
the britain that has always championed liberty , tolerance , and social responsibility should be ready once again to lead a progressive movement , spearheading action to fight climate change , resist protectionism , and encourage sustainable growth .
it must lead in mobilizing europe to make the global economy work for people , protecting them from injustice and inequity .
yet the expectation of reasonable consumer protection is built into our economies .
if a company sells you a car that , say , is not adequately tested , resulting in injury , the company pays a price .
the same goes for virtually any other consumer-facing business , from airlines to foods suppliers .
a restaurant can not evade responsibility for serving expired food simply by posting a sign saying , “ customers beware . ”
when it comes to facebook , moreover , users are not just passive consumers , given that the company traffics in their data .
the implicit model is that of the “ guest worker ” who comes and goes ; in practice , a sizeable share of economic migrants from poorer parts of europe stay in their country of destination , fueling an increase in support for anti-immigrant parties .
the asylum system is totally unprepared to deal with the new generation of refugees , who are ineligible under the existing framework , because they are fleeing not from specific acts of persecution , but from the disintegration of their states .
they can be provided “ humanitarian protection ” or be granted “ discretionary leave to remain ” for a short period ; but then they can be deported as illegal immigrants .
so what is to be done ?
temporary residence status , in europe or outside , would be reasonable if a rapid return to normalcy in the refugees ’ countries of origin was a realistic prospect .
in other words , mrs. obama is managing to set herself up , unprecedentedly , as the “ people ’s first lady . ”
she has carefully studied not only jackie kennedy – a comparison obvious from her sheath dresses , boat collars , and page-boy haircut – but also the triumphs and failures of that other glamorous but underestimated stealth radical , princess diana .
princess di ’s legacy in generating iconography that opened the way to tremendous social change is grossly underappreciated .
in her brief lifetime , she was often lauded for qualities ( her beauty and style ) that were secondary to her life ’s work , and derided for other aspects of her character ( her emotionality and chaotic personal life ) that were equally beside the point .
as a result , few people noticed how genuinely , powerfully transformative her agenda was , how well she had thought it out , and how audaciously she sought to manage it .
instead , both are busy designing another round of stimulus that will involve even more political and policy risks .
other risks are already giving central bankers headaches .
the protracted brexit process is hampering the bank of england ’s longer-term policy strategy , while the short-term impact on global growth of governments ’ weaponization of trade tariffs is complicating the task of both the fed and the ecb .
meanwhile , some pro-growth policies currently being mooted could , if not well designed , increase the risk of disruptive financial instability and thus further complicate central bankers ’ task .
the notion of a “ people ’s qe ” – that is , a more direct channeling of central-bank funding to the population – is getting more attention from both sides of the political spectrum .
he himself presided over many violations , a fact noted by the osce back in 1999 .
he resigned only after winning election to parliament .
clearly , ak zhol used accusations of impropriety as a weapon against the government parties .
indeed , many opposition groups engaged in dirty tricks .
nevertheless , the elections represented significant progress .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
china ’s economic performance over the past four decades has been truly impressive .
over the short term , it seems to move like a crab – two steps forward , one step back , and one step sideways .
yet asean ’s long-term progress is undeniable .
its combined gdp has grown from $ 95 billion in 1970 to $ 2.5 trillion in 2014 .
and it is the only reliable platform for geopolitical engagement in the asia-pacific region , unique in its ability to convene meetings attended by all of the world ’s great powers , from the united states and the european union to china and russia .
asean continues to face serious challenges .
much of modern economic and financial theory is based on the assumption that people are rational , and thus that they systematically maximize their own happiness , or as economists call it , their “ utility . ”
when samuelson took on the subject in his 1947 book , he did not look into the brain , but relied instead on “ revealed preference . ”
people ’s objectives are revealed only by observing their economic activities .
under samuelson ’s guidance , generations of economists have based their research not on any physical structure underlying thought and behavior , but only on the assumption of rationality .
as a result , glimcher is skeptical of prevailing economic theory , and is seeking a physical basis for it in the brain .
central-bank balance sheets have swelled , and policy rates have reached their “ near zero ” lower bounds .
there is plenty of cheap water , it seems , but the horse refuses to drink .
with no signs of inflation , and growth still tepid and fragile , many anticipate chronic slow growth , with some even fearing another global recession .
but policymakers have one more option : a shift to “ purer ” fiscal policy , in which they directly finance government spending by printing money – a so-called “ helicopter drop . ”
the new money would bypass the financial and corporate sectors and go straight to the thirstiest horses : middle - and lower-income consumers .
the case went to the local court , where the judge ruled it an " accidental traffic disturbance " and gave the driver a two-year suspended sentence .
the judge 's ruling spurred rumors that he went easy on her because her husband was related to senior provincial officials .
it quickly became a story of " rich versus poor , " widely cited as an example of high-level corruption .
over the next few months , newspapers and television stations ran with the story as it snowballed into a national obsession .
alarmed by the public reaction , the harbin magistrate ordered the case reopened , only to have the suspended sentence confirmed when the case was closed this march .
repeated military interventions in large muslim nations – egypt , indonesia , pakistan , and turkey – have impeded orderly political development .
but these countries ’ rising middle classes have begun to move their political systems in another direction – a testament to the power that they now wield .
that power has increased for several reasons , the most important of which is demographic .
most large muslim countries have very young populations , with a median age in the mid - to upper twenties .
with more than half of these countries ’ populations below the age of 30 , political development has been able to move forward despite the recalcitrance of entrenched elites .
though latin america ’s economies are doing well now thanks to reform and high commodity prices , there are underlying problems .
the goal is to implement a comprehensive set of fiscal responsibility laws that curb the ability of legislatures and ministers to increase spending relentlessly .
the rules need to impose limits on deficits , spending , and debt , and require transparency so that the public knows what ’s going on .
if matched by a genuine commitment to develop fiscal credibility , countries could increase their economic growth substantially .
third on the panel ’s list is increased investment in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure .
second , countries must focus on building the underlying digital infrastructure needed for sustained success , and avoid the allure of the latest shiny innovations .
too often , developing countries have seized on new technologies – “ distribute tablets to schoolchildren ! ” – without giving enough thought to how they will be used in specific national contexts .
this has resulted in many disappointing pilot projects that failed to deliver sustainable impact at scale .
a new report from the pathways for prosperity commission on technology and inclusive development , based at the university of oxford ’s blavatnik school of government , suggests how countries can address this problem .
the report urges them to establish a foundation of “ digital building blocks ” – including basic infrastructure and skills – in order to harness positive disruptions to education and health services .
but , overall , it is hard to deny that the global economy lacks momentum .
this is partly because trees can not grow forever : china ’s economy could not continue to get 10 % bigger every year .
and in part , it is because growth is not unconditionally desirable : citizens may be better off with a little less of it , and more clean air .
but many countries are still poor enough to be endowed with strong growth potential , and many others , though rich , have not yet recovered from the global financial crisis .
so there must be something else holding growth back .
in april 2009 , and again in april-may 2010 , the disenfranchised red shirts camped in the streets of bangkok to demand new elections , but were dispersed by the army , with 91 fatalities .
despite their setbacks and lost credibility following the torching of bangkok ’s central business district , the red shirts have grown in number and demonstrate monthly against abhisit ’s government .
and , after two years , pad yellow shirts have also returned to the streets to show their disillusion with abhisit .
pad ringleaders now denounce all politicians as corrupt and extol the virtue of the monarchy .
using the weapons of an anti-corruption drive and rising nationalism ( the result of a periodically violent border dispute with cambodia ) , the royalist-conservative movement is implicitly pointing to an extra-constitutional solution to thailand ’s political standoff .
industry analysts predict that ai will drive growth in the coming years and decades .
gartner , a research and advisory firm , estimates that ai-enabled tools will generate $ 2.9 trillion in business value by 2021 , while pwc forecasts that by 2030 , ai could contribute as much as $ 15.7 trillion to the global economy .
some estimates show that companies could save as much as $ 4 trillion annually with ai automation .
and the benefits for businesses will go far beyond savings , as automation will spur innovation , improve forecasting , optimize operations , and lead to better customer service .
in any technological transition , those leading the change can not lose sight of the human element ; there are some things even the smartest machines will never do .
because they can not be good at everything , they must concentrate on what they are best at – that is , on their comparative advantage .
they should make a few things very well and exchange them for other goods that are made better elsewhere , thus exploiting the gains from trade .
but , while some ideas are intuitive or obvious , they can also be wrong and dangerous .
as is often the case , it is not what you do n’t know , but what you mistakenly think you know , that hurts you .
and the idea that cities and countries actually do specialize , and that therefore they should specialize , is one of those very wrong and dangerous ideas .
the trouble is that germany has not been forced to choose .
it can continue to do no more than the minimum to preserve the euro .
this is clearly merkel ’s preferred choice , at least until after the next election .
europe would be infinitely better off if germany made a definitive choice between eurobonds and a eurozone exit , regardless of the outcome ; indeed , germany would be better off as well .
the situation is deteriorating , and , in the longer term , it is bound to become unsustainable .
but the bilateral relationship has deepened significantly lately , exemplified by last week ’s forum , which resulted in more than 25 trade and other agreements covering areas ranging from agriculture to technology .
both leaders gush that their two countries are now on better terms than ever .
for russia , closer ties with china are undoubtedly tempting .
after five years of international sanctions , imposed on russia after its annexation of crimea , xi ’s overtures provide a seemingly welcome reprieve .
but , before putin places too much faith in xi , he would do well to recall a 1960s soviet dissident song , “ people are brothers ; i will hug the chinese , ” which mocked ill-fated early attempts at a russo-chinese union .
warsaw – donald tusk ’s term as president of the european council will end on 30 november , which is perfect timing for the polish opposition .
after the parliamentary election in late october , poland will hold its presidential election in april 2020 , and opposition voters already see tusk as the only viable candidate .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
and if you want him to pay , rezz.it will help you to collect without feeling like a cheapskate .
or you may have a set of under-used dining room chairs .
you do n’t particularly want to lend them out every day , but if someone is willing to pay , say , $ 200 to rent them for a dinner party , the trouble might be worth it .
so you can set a high price to offset the inconvenience and make money on the side .
and you can post different prices for different times : $ 20,000 to rent my house in london during the olympics , $ 10,000 over christmas , or $ 1,000 any other time .
fifth , both sides should regard the november 14-16 asia-pacific economic cooperation summit in santiago as the last chance for signing a deal .
following high-level negotiations between chinese vice premier liu he and us trade representative robert lighthizer this month , outstanding problems should be agreed in beijing in early november .
getting the deal done before thanksgiving will be critical to undergird us business and consumer confidence for the christmas season .
i am one of the few commentators who have argued all year that , despite the political fireworks , trump and xi ’s underlying interests make a deal more likely than not .
but the recently announced impeachment proceedings against trump could throw a wrench into this process .
european union institutions , as well as germany , tend to prefer “ strategic autonomy , ” while france favors the concept of “ european sovereignty . ”
but the two concepts are often used interchangeably , and are rarely defined precisely .
in an effort to clarify matters , my colleagues and i recently proposed an operationalized definition of “ european strategic autonomy . ”
we also analyzed the likely obstacles , difficulties , and conflicts should german and european policymakers decide to pursue this goal .
we understand strategic autonomy as the ability to set one ’s own priorities and make one ’s own decisions in matters of foreign policy and security , together with the institutional , political , and material means to realize these choices , either in cooperation with third parties , or alone if need be .
in fact , the eradication of poppy crops not only damage local communities and undermines the international community ’s goals , but it is also failing : opium production last year was at an all-time high .
in september , the united nations office on drugs crime announced that poppy cultivation soared by a record-high 60 % .
eradication will never be successful in afghanistan , because it destroys the single crop that will grow in the south ’s harsh climate – and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people .
so a new , long-term , economically sustainable solution is urgently needed – one that directly engages with the communities that are suffering most – in order to achieve the support of the deeply impoverished rural population .
as a way to address this dilemma , the senlis council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for afghanistan , which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process .
but the bush administration scares us .
the concept of preventive war is poised to incite precisely that clash of civilizations which was predicted a decade ago and which must be avoided .
the muslim faith counts a billion men and women around the world among its followers .
five percent of them have declared war on our civilization and are ready to engage in murder in order to put an end to western domination .
ninety-five percent of muslims , including most of their religious leaders , want only to live in peace and to put an end to the long humiliation of islam that only the advent of democracy and development in the muslim world can make possible .
but blindly sticking to principle would have been a highly risky option for the ecb .
it would have meant accepting in 2012 what has been called “ redenomination risk ” – economic newspeak for a eurozone breakup .
nonetheless , by launching its omt scheme , the ecb has committed german ( and other northern european ) taxpayers , without their parliaments ’ approval , to a potential obligation to bail out – well , whom , exactly ?
indeed , it appears that the typical northern european taxpayer supports the typical stakeholder in northern european banks that are over-exposed to southern european debtors .
likewise , german legal scholars interpret the ecb ’s activities as being incompatible with european treaty provisions that prohibit bailouts and monetary financing of the debt of eurozone members .
by comparing the fight against isis to the struggle against the soviet union , trump elevates the terrorist organization to the status of a great power .
this contributes to perceptions that isis is much more potent than it actually is , again playing into the hands of isis recruiters .
trump has also expressed his interest in cooperating with russia to take down isis , seemingly oblivious to the fact that russia ’s involvement in syria is focused on propping up assad ’s regime .
such a partnership could lead trump to make a deal with iran , which is more than willing to fight sunni radicals in iraq and syria .
iran is now permitting russian long-range bombers to using one of its air bases to strike syria , complicating obama ’s already-strenuous effort to reach an understanding with russian president vladimir putin on ending the civil war .
indeed , a recent mckinsey survey revealed not only that europeans aspire to a more vibrant economy , higher incomes , and better public services ( especially health care and education ) , but also that they are prepared to accept tradeoffs , including longer hours and reduced social protection , to achieve them .
a whopping 91 % of the 16,000 respondents said that they would favor changes to the status quo , even if it required some sacrifice .
and the status quo is in urgent need of change .
as it stands , european economic output per capita remains well below 2008 levels .
in most european countries , gross sovereign debt exceeds the threshold ( 60 % of gdp ) established by the stability and growth pact .
colombo – sri lanka has been deservedly praised for the progress it has made since the end of the war against the separatist tamil tigers in 2009 .
the economy has grown at an average annual rate of 6.7 % , and education and health statistics are impressive .
all developing countries face myriad challenges , but this is especially the case for a country that has suffered an intense 30-year civil war .
the government will need to set priorities ; but success will require a comprehensive approach .
underlying wars such as the fight with the tamil tigers are , typically , social and economic grievances such as real or perceived discrimination , and the failure of government to address wealth and income disparities adequately .
the western democracies , as most historians now acknowledge , played a comparatively minor role in the great military struggle .
the pope believed that he could either condemn both totalitarian powers or condemn neither of them .
but any condemnation by pius of communism would have been exploited by nazi propaganda as support for hitler ’s war effort .
and a condemnation of nazism could have been misinterpreted as an attack not against nazism , but against germany in its life-and-death struggle with stalin ’s communist regime .
very few people in the vatican – indeed , in europe at large – had any real knowledge in those days of the vast industrial might of the united states .
the data traveling instantaneously around the world are indifferent to national boundaries .
i believe that the economic and social impact of such data will rival , even surpass , the roles that petroleum and the internal combustion engine played in the twentieth century .
by its nature , data easily overcomes physical obstacles .
networked , its effects and advantages multiply and then multiply further .
conversely , should the equivalent of even a single closed-off room appear anywhere , the resulting losses extend to the entire network .
meanwhile , serious trade reform did not start until 1991-93 .
governments in both countries focused their scarce political capital and administrative resources on areas other than trade liberalization .
because both india and china did increase trade substantially , they are both considered as globalizers by the world bank 's criterion .
but as their experience reveals -- along with the experiences of many others , such as south korea , taiwan , and vietnam -- deep trade liberalization is hardly ever a factor in fostering higher growth and expanded trade early on .
it is good to see the world bank catching on to this simple reality .
i felt a prodigious , restless energy that i suspected he could not turn off if he wanted to . soon after i began to recount my observations , he took me to a map of vietnam and asked me to locate the areas of destruction .
i felt that the request was a test – one that i was prepared to take , as i had carried maps with me in the forward air-control planes .
he seemed deeply engaged , but made no comment , asking me only if i had anything in writing .
i said that i did , but that it was in longhand .
he suggested that i produce a typed copy , and provided me with the office of a general who was away .
at the moment , these types of innovations are not featured prominently in most hunger-alleviation strategies .
but that is slowly changing , especially as more people in emerging economies connect to mobile networks , and apps designed to collect and share agricultural information become increasingly accessible .
for example , in egypt , sudan , and ethiopia , local extension services are delivering real-time weather data to vegetable farmers via sms .
in west africa , private companies such as ignitia are expanding the accuracy and precision of sms weather alerts to remote farmers .
in mongolia , rural herders receive information about disease outbreaks to help them maintain the health of their livestock .
brussels – as the world ’s financial elite converges on washington , dc , for the annual meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank , they can not escape yet another clarion call to reverse the retreat of globalization .
faltering trade , it is assumed , must be an adverse trend that needs to be addressed .
but the assumption is simplistic , at best .
the problem lies in a lack of understanding of what drove trade growth over the last few decades .
to be sure , there have been efforts to grasp the current slowdown .
finally , a renminbi-depreciation policy would lead to a sharp escalation in the global currency war .
in an era of unprecedented quantitative easing , competitive currency devaluation has become the norm for the world 's major exporters – first the us , then japan , and now europe .
if china joined this race to the bottom , others would be tempted to escalate their actions and world financial markets would be subject to yet another source of serious instability .
just as china resisted the temptation of renminbi depreciation during the asian financial crisis of 1997-98 – a decision that may have played a pivotal role in arresting regional contagion – it must stay the course today .
that is all the more important in a disorderly climate of qe , where china 's role as a currency anchor may take on even greater importance than it did in the late 1990s .
and even if fiscal policymakers were to become more responsive , they would be starting from a point of relatively high deficits and debt .
prolonging the current expansion will require great care .
policymakers , particularly congress , need to avoid big mistakes and minimize the risk of market accidents while doing more to promote growth .
the us needs a well-targeted approach to modernizing and upgrading its infrastructure .
policymakers and leading economists also must be more sensitive to how the fruits of economic growth are shared ; among other things , there should be better protections for the most vulnerable segments of society and stronger automatic stabilizers .
for many years , the imf has engaged its member countries in a process known as “ surveillance , ” in which it monitors , analyzes , and consults on each country ’s economic policies – both exchange rate policies and relevant domestic policies .
these regular checkups help to identify potential vulnerabilities and maintain economic stability .
however , the increasingly complex policy challenges of the globalized economy demand a fresh look at this process .
this june , the imf ’s executive board did just that , reaching a broad consensus on updating surveillance to make it more focused and effective .
this is one of the most important reforms to the fund ’s work in the 30 years since the surveillance process was designed .
four measures are needed to achieve this .
first , a debt conference is needed , with creditors of the southern european governments and banks forgiving part of the debt .
the creditors relinquishing part of their claims must include public entities , first and foremost the ecb , that have now largely replaced private lenders .
second , eurozone members whose path to regaining competitiveness through price and wage reductions is too long and grueling , and whose societies risk being rent asunder by the necessary imposition of austerity , must temporarily exit the monetary union .
the pain of exiting should be cushioned with communal financial help , which would not be necessary for long , because a devaluation of the new currency would quickly restore competitiveness .
this is important because ukraine has only partly fulfilled imf agreements that it signed in 1994 , 2008 , and 2010 .
finally , the eu should insist that ukrainian authorities halt all politically motivated criminal cases and release those who are incarcerated for political crimes .
selective use of justice has badly damaged the yanukovych administration ’s reputation .
steps in this direction would greatly improve the ukrainian government ’s relations with the eu and the us .
these three steps would not resolve all of the difficulties in ukraine ’s relations with the eu .
arguing that his efforts to improve relations with russia are in america ’s national interest , trump , shortly after the summit , invited putin to visit the white house in the near future .
putin has just reciprocated with an invitation for trump to come to the kremlin .
but trump ’s enthusiasm ( and desire to defy his critics ) is no substitute for a genuine openness to mutually beneficial cooperation , like that seen in 1959 , when dwight eisenhower invited nikita khrushchev to visit the us , and in 1986 , when mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan met in reykjavík .
instead , trump ’s actions just look like more kowtowing , raising the hackles of other us leaders .
for many members of the us security establishment , putin ’s apparent influence over trump poses an existential threat to american democracy , much as the soviet union did at the height of the cold war .
washington , dc – this month , european citizens will head to the polls to select the 751 members of the european parliament to represent 507 million people .
the way the election campaign has unfolded marks a small but significant step in the emergence of the first transnational political space in european – indeed , world – history .
to be sure , the european parliament elections have been bringing smaller shares of voters to the polls : 43 % in 2009 , compared to almost 60 % in 1978-1994 .
nonetheless , the participation rate over the last decade is comparable to average turnout in american congressional elections .
given the perceived remoteness of the european parliament and widespread frustration with the european union ’s bureaucracy , the level of participation and the movement toward transnational politics is remarkable .
however , the bomb was not encased in metal and the terrorist was the only person killed .
to an outsider , the episode looks like a colossal security failure , as if the head of the fbi personally greeted one of bin laden ’s lieutenants at a garden party .
but it is just this highly personalized form of politics that the saudi royals have adopted with defecting al-qaeda ’s members .
indeed , this policy , even with its risks , partly explains al-qaeda ’s defeat in saudi arabia .
highly personalized politics form part of what might be called saudi arabia ’s theatre of state , which keeps the royals firmly in power .
it was said of prime minister levi eshkol that he spoke seven languages , all of them in yiddish .
of eban it could be said that he spoke ten languages , and all of them with an oxford/cambridge accent .
yet what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of israeli politics .
perhaps eban was too urbane , too much of a scholar and gentleman to be able to make it - in disraeli 's phrase - to the top of the greasy pole .
together with golda meir and moshe dayan he had to leave government in 1974 in the wake of the yom kippur war .
but whether europe as a whole avoids lost decades of economic growth still hangs in the balance , and depends on whether southern european governments can rapidly restore competitiveness .
the process by which southern europe became uncompetitive in the first place was driven by market price signals – by the incentives those signals created for entrepreneurs , and by how entrepreneurs ’ individually rational responses played out in macroeconomic terms .
northern europeans with money to invest were willing to lend on extraordinarily easy terms to those in the south who wanted to spend , and ample pre-2007 spending made employers there willing to raise wages rapidly .
as a result , southern europe adopted an economic configuration in which its wage , price , and productivity levels made sense only so long as it spent € 13 for every € 12 that it earned , with northern europe financing the missing euro .
northern europe , meanwhile , adopted wage and productivity levels that made sense only as long as it spent less than one euro for every euro that it earned .
a global economic downturn is the last thing the world needs at a time when it is already beset with risks , including a possible no-deal brexit and populist gains in the european parliament election in may .
of course , while trump does not spare his allies , his primary target remains china .
after all , the competition between the us and china extends far beyond trade .
although the us maintains military , technological , financial , and soft-power superiority , china has been steadily catching up , leading to bipartisan support in the us for a more confrontational approach .
last october , us vice president mike pence bluntly accused china of technology theft , predatory economic expansion , and military aggression .
they can be answered , and periodically revised , only through an iterative process of strategic interaction between public agencies and private firms .
a common theme that emerges from studies of so-called place-based policies , such as regionally targeted employment subsidies and infrastructure investment , is the heavily contingent nature of success .
few policies work off the shelf and reliably across diverse settings .
competitions among states and localities to attract large employers with tax and other subsidies work especially badly .
recent high-profile deals for foxconn and amazon , in wisconsin and new york respectively , have blown up .
shanghai – china is facing the difficult task of managing a soft economic landing , after decades of spectacular expansion .
naysayers abound , but never mind them .
china has an advantage that other countries in today ’s troubled global economy lack : a clear path forward .
if china carries out a sustained , comprehensive effort to raise productivity , it can address its growth challenges , reduce the risks of financial crisis , and complete its transition to a consumption-driven , high-income economy with a large and affluent middle class .
if it does , its annual gdp could be an estimated $ 5 trillion larger by 2030 than it is likely to be if policymakers continue to pursue investment-led growth .
london – as governments across western europe began bailing out banks and their depositors , eastern europeans watched nervously , unsure about what the global financial storm would mean for them .
now that the storm has hit , the fragile bonds of european solidarity are being tested .
two countries – hungary and ukraine – have already asked for large packages of support .
several more could do so over the next month if frozen credit markets do not thaw .
if the situation continues until the end of the year , which can not be ruled out , many more countries could experience serious banking crises .
but the big question for health professionals is whether the quantity or the quality of foods is to blame .
this is an important distinction , because quantity is determined by the user , while quality is determined by the industry .
some health experts argue that specific components of processed foods – in particular , sugar – are as addictive as cocaine and heroin .
for example , sugar is consistently the ingredient with the highest score on the yale food addiction scale , which measures people ’s food cravings .
the processed food industry says , “ you need sugar to live . ”
a closely coordinated effort amongst private and public sector partners to deliver oral polio vaccine to every child under five was the key to success .
globally , international donors and un agencies worked closely with national governments , tallying the exact needs for massive polio immunization campaigns aimed at reaching hundreds of millions of children .
last year alone , the global polio eradication initiative delivered almost two billion doses of polio vaccine to 575 million children in 94 countries .
in each country , partner institutions including the minister of health , the world health organization , unicef , other un agencies , service groups like rotary international , representatives from donor governments , the private sector and non-governmental organizations , jointly and carefully planned each immunization campaign .
every detail , from the number of bicycles and boats needed to deliver the vaccine to otherwise inaccessible areas , to the refrigerators and cold boxes needed to keep the vaccine potent , even the batteries necessary to power them , were counted and budgeted .
in an increasingly deal-based world , a new g6 might offer a defense of the rules-based system .
still , one wonders if the eu is capable of putting up a united front .
with the bloc splintering into distinct political tribes , it is becoming easier for other powers to pursue a divide-and-conquer strategy .
this has long been russia ’s strategy , and it is now being adopted by china and the us , too .
for example , in 2016 , southern and eastern eu member states that rely on chinese investment managed to water down a joint eu statement on china ’s territorial encroachments in the south china sea .
corruption is one of africa 's endemic problems .
indeed , it is a key issue in nigeria 's approaching presidential election , given president obasanjo 's high-minded but failed struggle to curb it .
but the winds of globalization were supposed to blow away the cobwebs of bribery and inefficiency .
harvard political scientist devesh kapur suggests why this is not happening .
evict the state from direct economic activity , curb its discretionary powers , and both economic efficiency and governance will improve .
florence – europeans who are eager to revive the continent ’s unification process have recently turned their attention to the founding of the united states .
many , however , reject the us precedent on the grounds that today ’s problems are too dissimilar from those encountered then .
others , who accept that federalist principles might be well suited to addressing the problems of a european common market , despair that the “ european people ” who could bring about this new political structure are missing .
but there are striking parallels between america ’s founding years and the european union ’s ongoing political and economic crisis .
in fact , the creation of the us constitution and the birth of the american people offer reasons to hope that some of the most difficult issues facing europe can one day be resolved .
moscow – ongoing street protests in hong kong and moscow have no doubt spooked the authoritarian duo of chinese president xi jinping and russian president vladimir putin .
the moscow protests , the largest in many years , must be keeping putin up at night , or they would n’t be dispersed with such unabated brutality .
yet rather than hold a dialogue with the people , putin has been demonstrating that he is in control , even preening for photos in a tight leather outfit with his favorite motorcycle gang .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the next year , the persian emperor , yazdegerd iii , fled to the border province of khorasan and the arabization of persia began , with persians taking arab names and converting to islam .
by 651 , almost all major urban centers in persia were under arab control , adding momentum to the process .
the mass conversion to islam among persians was the first step toward the establishment of the first caliphate , a political-religious state comprising all muslim lands .
at various times in history , caliphates have extended into asia , africa , and parts of europe .
the effort by various forces seeking to control or restore the caliphate is a recurrent theme throughout islam ’s history .
the russian government ’s reluctance to fight corruption and strengthen the country ’s legal institutions reflects a perverse – yet stable – political equilibrium .
in 2010 , tsyvinski and i predicted a “ 70-80 scenario ” in russia in the coming years : as oil prices , which had plummeted to $ 40 per barrel , recovered and surpassed $ 70-80 / barrel , russia would return to the stagnation of the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s .
sure enough , gdp growth from 2010 to 2012 , though averaging a respectable 4 % , turned out to have been driven by the post-crisis recovery and the further increase in oil prices to $ 100/barrel .
now all of these short-term factors have been exhausted , and a brezhnev-like period of stagnation has begun .
russia ’s political elite understands that the economy is capable of 5-6 % annual growth .
left-wing proponents of so-called modern monetary theory argue that larger permanent fiscal deficits are sustainable when monetized during periods of economic slack , because there is no risk of runaway inflation .
following this logic , in the uk , the labour party has proposed a “ people ’s qe , ” whereby the central bank would print money to finance direct fiscal transfers to households – rather than to bankers and investors .
others , including mainstream economists such as adair turner , the former chairman of the uk financial services authority , have called for “ helicopter drops ” : direct cash transfers to consumers through central-bank-financed fiscal deficits .
still others , such as former fed vice chair stanley fischer and his colleagues at blackrock , have proposed a “ standing emergency fiscal facility , ” which would allow the central bank to finance large fiscal deficits in the event of a deep recession .
despite differences in terminology , all of these proposals are variants of the same idea : large fiscal deficits monetized by central banks should be used to stimulate aggregate demand in the event of the next slump .
most developing countries i know spend too little money devising good projects .
when the private sector does , transforming ideas into bankable projects is often very difficult because many difficult-to-coordinate public-sector decisions or actions are involved .
so , let ’s assume that a toll road project is approved , a concession contract is prepared , and companies bid on it .
the bidders need to plan for two phases : engineering , procurement , and construction ( epc ) , and a longer phase of operation when toll revenue is collected to recover incurred costs and expected returns .
there are plenty of uncertainties in both phases , but especially during epc , which may last 3-7 years , depending on the project .
besides , there is a clear business rationale for prioritizing green finance.investors and rating agencies are increasingly scrutinizing investment portfolios for potential “ stranded assets , ” such as oil and gas projects that will become obsolete as more renewable-energy technologies become commercially viable .
many existing fossil-fuel projects already have shorter life spans than was previously expected , and financial portfolios that rely heavily on such assets will increasingly be at risk of devaluation .
with some governments abandoning previous commitments to reduce emissions , one might think that the global effort to tackle climate change is losing steam .
but we should not underestimate the power of financial pressure to effect change , nor can we ignore the determination of local governments and the private sector to act where national government have not .
nonetheless , to get and keep all governments on board , the low-carbon transition must be inclusive .
defend " family values " , whatever that means .
recently , a group of parliament members ( quite a large one - 30 deputies ` ) left the majority post-solidarity party and created a new " polish family " party with the slogan that the ruling coalition is in " the service of brussels . "
a less agressive anti-europeanism comes from a tendency that struggles for old values like honor and virtue .
in practice this movement is also motivated by little more than a fear of change .
but here people who were active in the former " solidarity " movement - for them a movement of community and not of individuals , a movement for public and not private freedom - form a new bloc of euro-antagonists .
that may be part of the story , but competition for talent and for customers seems intense between investment banks and others , yet they have collectively been extravagantly rewarded at the expense of those customers .
an alternative hypothesis , which seems to fit the facts , recently emerged from the paul woolley centre for the study of dysfunctionality in capital markets , at the london school of economics .
researchers there argue that in fragile speculative industries ( and finance has certainly been in that category in recent years ) it is hard for investors to monitor those who manage their money .
they can see short-term returns , but they do not understand very well how those returns are generated .
managers can demand higher and higher returns in the upturn .
the united states is consistently ranked among the world ’s top ten countries for innovation , including by insead ’s global innovation index .
but , on the global peace index , it is ranked 88th of 153 countries .
likewise , the united kingdom and the netherlands rank , respectively , fifth and sixth on the innovation index , but only 28th and 29th on the peace index .
conversely , bhutan is among the top 20 most peaceful nations , but does not even make it onto innovation indices .
of course , crime , terrorism , conflict , and political instability severe enough to cause a total breakdown of law and order significantly impede creativity and innovation .
but merkel still defends weber , and , apart from macron and dutch prime minister mark rutte , most eu leaders are reluctant to confront the european parliament on the spitzenkandidaten issue .
that may shorten the odds for margrethe vestager – who is not from the epp , but who is , in a sense , a liberal spitzenkandidat – while lengthening them for michel barnier , who is from the epp but is not a spitzenkandidat .
if the council succeeds in ruling out weber and his populist supporters , macron will claim it as a success .
finally , the election provides a check on german hegemony within the eu more broadly .
germany ’s christian democratic union ( cdu ) has been weakened , and the country ’s greens have grown stronger .
on january 1 , 2007 , ban ki-moon , south korea ’s former foreign minister , will become united nations secretary-general , following kofi annan ’s ten-year tenure .
annan inspired the world with his diplomacy and leadership on poverty reduction and human rights , but the war in iraq divided the world and drew attention and financial resources away from crisis regions and critical long-term problems like climate change , disease control , sustainable energy , and access to water .
with the recent elections in the united states and the rise of asia ’s global influence , there is an opportunity to turn the world ’s attention to the most critical challenges facing our planet .
in addition to the long-term challenges of poverty , the environment , nuclear proliferation , and un reform , the new secretary-general will inherit a long list of hotspots : iraq , iran , afghanistan , palestine , lebanon , somalia , myanmar , sudan , north korea , and others .
recent attempts to influence developments in these countries through threats and sanctions , and sometimes war , have failed .
that is why the disastrous free-for-all in trade policy during the 1930 ’s greatly aggravated the great depression .
many complain that something similar , if less grand in scope , is taking place today .
an outfit called the global trade alert ( gta ) has been at the forefront , raising alarm bells about what it calls “ a protectionist juggernaut . ”
the gta ’s latest report identifies no fewer than 192 separate protectionist actions since november 2008 , with china as the most common target .
this number has been widely quoted in the financial press .
if people come to a country to earn higher wages , the pie available for distribution gets bigger ; but if they come for the social benefits , the pie gets smaller .
given this , why not have a system in which host countries and countries of origin share the costs of social benefits for migrants ?
host countries could assume the responsibility for administering benefits such as unemployment insurance , sick pay , and pensions .
and countries of origin could continue to provide benefits not related to the employment relationship , such as allowances for children staying at home and services for migrants who are too old or sick to work when they arrive .
such a change would create a win-win situation for the eu , because it would reduce the destructive appeal of welfare magnetism and give the british grounds to reconsider their exit decision with their heads held high .
what needs to be done has long been clear .
the price of the monetary union ’s survival , and thus that of the european project , is more community : a banking union , fiscal union , and political union .
those who oppose this because they fear common accountability , transfers from rich to poor , and a loss of national sovereignty will have to accept europe ’s re-nationalization – and thus its exit from the world stage .
no alternative – and certainly not the statusquo – will work .
it has become common knowledge in europe that the ongoing crisis will either destroy the eu or bring about a political union , and that , without a solidarity-based solution to existing debt and a partial mutualization of new debt , the euro can not be saved .
the eu is not deprived of instruments – the so-called “ structural funds ” that finance investment in poorer regions – but it does not have a strategy to use them .
so the outcome of months of discussion might be better characterized as “ emu 1.7.3 ” than “ emu 2.0 . ”
more bugs will have to be fixed , including new bugs found in the fixes .
for investors , the reform process may seem impossibly long and hesitant .
but , by the standards of international negotiations and european governance , it has been exceptionally fast .
although educational possibilities and structures have gradually been diversified , the major shortcoming of most european educational systems remains : students have too few choices , and teachers , if they want to remain in their profession , must adhere to a severely compartmentalized pedagogy .
as with corporate monopolies , the consumers ( students ) are often seen as a homogeneous mass , where all students can be educated according to the same pedagogical approach .
but schools must be able to meet the needs and abilities of individual children in a way that makes learning a stimulating adventure .
other countries might find sweden ’s system worth studying .
its schools are financed by local communities and work within the framework of a national curriculum designed by the parliament and government .
from that point on , they are in and out of the prison system , and have little chance of ever getting a legal job that enables them to escape poverty .
their children grow up without a parent at home – and without hope and support .
the children of drug users often become drug users themselves ; they , too , frequently end up in jail or suffer violence or early death .
what is crazy about this is that the us has missed the obvious point – and has missed it for 40 years .
to break the cycle of poverty , a country needs to invest in its children ’s future , not in the imprisonment of 2.3 million people a year , many for non-violent crimes that are symptoms of poverty .
the non-residential construction boom this created helped not only to absorb the labor force that was leaving rural areas but also to achieve a remarkable reduction in inequality .
in this services-export-led growth strategy , skill shortages did not become a major problem , thanks to a fairly open immigration policy , which allowed the country to use the talent that colombia , among other countries , was unable to keep .
the comparison between these two approaches is clear .
colombia ’s policymakers have been hoping that if they adopt best-practice legislation and regulation , somebody will come .
and if they do not , they can still bask in the international accolades they receive from foreign entities .
moreover , there is now massive re-leveraging of the public sector in advanced economies , with huge budget deficits and public-debt accumulation driven by automatic stabilizers , counter-cyclical keynesian fiscal stimulus , and the immense costs of socializing the financial system ’s losses .
at best , we face a protracted period of anemic , below-trend growth in advanced economies as deleveraging by households , financial institutions , and governments starts to feed through to consumption and investment .
at the global level , the countries that spent too much – the united states , the united kingdom , spain , greece , and elsewhere – now need to deleverage and are spending , consuming , and importing less .
but countries that saved too much – china , emerging asia , germany , and japan – are not spending more to compensate for the fall in spending by deleveraging countries .
thus , the recovery of global aggregate demand will be weak , pushing global growth much lower .
the present crisis , the fall of wall street , is to neo-liberalism what the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 was to communism .
the global dimension of this crisis surprisingly also has a positive side .
the international community is now charged with thinking about how to reorganize the financial sector and minimize the risk of similar catastrophe in the future .
until now , a major part of the problem was countries ’ unwillingness to cooperate .
previous demands for stricter regulations came to nothing because of financial sector opposition .
as much as possible , the liberal state should be neutral on such matters , leaving it to each citizen to determine whether he should give his financial support to the church of rome or the one at bayreuth .
in contrast to the militant liberalism of the french tradition , this neutralist liberal philosophy strives to prevent either side in the ongoing culture war from using the state ’s coercive powers of taxation as a weapon in the struggle for men ’s souls .
in advocating disestablishment of both religious and secular orthodoxies , i do not wish to trivialize the importance of their ongoing contest over the meaning of life .
it is because of the infinite importance of this great debate that the state should strive to be neutral .
after all , if the state ostentatiously takes sides in this conversation , it can not avoid denigrating the ultimate convictions of many of its dissenting citizens .
new york – twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of communism , the world is facing another stark choice between two fundamentally different forms of organization : international capitalism and state capitalism .
the former , represented by the united states , has broken down , and the latter , represented by china , is on the rise .
following the path of least resistance will lead to the gradual disintegration of the international financial system .
a new multilateral system based on sounder principles must be invented .
while international cooperation on regulatory reform is difficult to achieve on a piecemeal basis , it may be attainable in a grand bargain that rearranges the entire financial order .
mario monti , the european union 's commissioner for competition policy , is often in the spotlight , usually to popular acclaim .
over the years , he has won important victories limiting state aid to business , one of europe 's most pernicious economic maladies .
today , however , the benefits derived from his achievements are at risk because of a series of stunning courtroom defeats .
with a competition case against software giant microsoft seemingly in the offing , commissioner monti will need to rediscover his footing fast .
within a period of just a few weeks , the european court of justice ( to which private parties can appeal decisions made by the commission ) voided three of monti 's decisions rejecting proposed corporate mergers .
so many proud and dignified people have been stripped of their livelihoods and forced to rely on one tiny meal a day , or nothing at all .
worse , these tragedies were avoidable ; we knew these crises were coming .
drought and hunger are slow-motion calamities that , with adequate planning and sufficient resources , can be averted .
but time and time again , humanitarian assistance in africa has come up short , as it did in somalia in 2011 and 2012 ; in niger in 2005 ; and in ethiopia during the 1980s .
then , as now , food insecurity was predicted long before the first hunger pangs were felt .
the bottom board includes transnational relations that cross borders outside the control of governments – everything from drugs to infectious diseases to climate change to transnational terrorism .
on this board , power is distributed chaotically among non-state actors .
no government can control outcomes without the cooperation of others .
here the us needs the help of europeans , and it makes no sense to call this world uni-polar , either .
on this bottom board , the degree of close civilian cooperation is also important , which is affected by a country ’s attractiveness or soft power .
translation : orderly resolution of global megabanks is an illusion .
as long as we allow cross-border banks at or close to their current scale , our political leaders will be unable to tolerate their failure .
and , because these large financial institutions are by any meaningful definition “ too big to fail , ” they can borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case .
worse , they have both motive and opportunity to grow even larger .
this form of government support amounts to a large implicit subsidy for big banks .
and , by raising the cost of extracting fossil fuels , it would contribute to the eventual phase-out of a sector that has no place in a climate-safe world .
fortunately , the world will not have to wait for moral suasion to carry the day .
fossil-fuel companies and governments are already facing intensifying legal pressure .
typhoon survivors in the philippines delivered a complaint to the country ’s commission on human rights , calling for an investigation into big fossil-fuel companies ’ responsibility for causing climate change .
the dutch group urgenda and nearly 900 co-plaintiffs successfully sued the dutch government , forcing it to adopt more stringent climate policies .
a few years ago , for example , chip-maker national semiconductor managed a complicated delivery system linking its three factories and three subcontractors in asia to its global network of customers .
it decided to out-source this operation to federal express , which uses a sophisticated on-line system for managing global deliveries and sales .
as a result , national semiconductor saw its delivery cycle to customers cut from four weeks to one week , and distribution costs cut from 2.9 % of sales to 1.2 % of sales .
several steps are needed to support a massive increase in the use of the internet in these other locations :
* liberalization of telecommunications , including entry of new private service providers , is crucial to reducing costs and spreading benefits .
if governments run larger fiscal deficits and finance this not with interest-bearing debt but with central-bank money – nominal demand will undoubtedly increase , producing some mix of higher inflation and higher real output .
the option of so-called “ helicopter money ” is therefore increasingly discussed .
but the debate about it is riddled with confusions .
it is often claimed that monetizing fiscal deficits would commit central banks to keeping interest rates low forever , an approach that is bound to produce excessive inflation .
it is simultaneously argued ( sometimes even by the same people ) that monetary financing would not stimulate demand because people will fear a future “ inflation tax . ”
geneva – when lehman brothers declared bankruptcy ten years ago , it suddenly became unclear who owed what to whom , who could n’t pay their debts , and who would go down next .
the result was that interbank credit markets froze , wall street panicked , and businesses went under , not just in the united states but around the world .
with politicians struggling to respond to the crisis , economic pundits were left wondering whether the “ great moderation ” of low business-cycle volatility since the 1980s was turning into another great depression .
in hindsight , the complacency in the run-up to the crisis was clearly unconscionable .
and yet little has changed in its aftermath .
the coalition partners disagree about how urgent it is to sort out this issue .
nonetheless , they have agreed that , within a year , a commission will provide different options and models to protect the german parliament ’s rights while providing assurances to germany ’s european partners that the country will be a reliable contributor to troop deployments .
should the spd , which will vote on the coalition agreement in early december , block the formation of the new government ( an unlikely development but not entirely out of the question ) , disputes over security and defense affairs would not be the culprit .
aside from a few minor particulars , consensus prevails .
for some , that is a cause for ambivalence .
badly needed biosafety legislation in nigeria and uganda , for example , has already been delayed .
much of the problem lies with a small group of anti-gm activists who object to the technology on “ moral ” grounds .
they typically claim that gm crops are unsafe – a view flatly rejected by the scientific community over the last two decades .
the world health organization has also confirmed that “ no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods . ”
indeed , every new gm crop variety must meet rigorous health , environmental , and efficacy standards .
perhaps regulators will find that they must require that the regulated have the desired contract provisions .
that solution will be incomplete , however , because not all derivatives traders are regulated financial institutions , and because many creditors would find ways to circumvent the contract and the requirement .
if the coverage is not complete , one can expect the regulated to complain that they have been placed at a competitive disadvantage .
regulators may well need to turn to bankruptcy laws to fix the problem .
the regulators ’ call to the isda for voluntary action will not amount to much if it is just a request to the derivatives industry to act against its own financial interests .
the result was section 124a of the penal code , under which any person who used “ words , signs , or visible representation … to excite disaffection against the government ” could be charged with sedition and potentially sentenced to life imprisonment .
in other words , no free speech for indians .
but even that was not sufficient for britain ’s leaders , who tightened the law further in 1898 , making it even harsher than the sedition law in england .
the british had concluded , in the words of the british lieutenant governor of bengal , that “ a sedition law which is adequate for a people ruled by a government of its own nationality and faith may be inadequate , or in some respects unsuited , for a country under foreign rule . ”
sedition was thus explicitly intended as an instrument to terrorize indian nationalists ; indeed , mahatma gandhi was among its prominent victims , though far from its last .
seoul – china – already the world ’s largest exporter , manufacturer , and international-reserve-asset holder – is poised to overtake the united states as the world ’s largest economy ( measured according to purchasing power parity ) this year .
now , it is using its growing clout to reshape global economic governance .
indeed , the country ’s days of following deng xiaoping ’s injunction to “ hide brightness and cherish obscurity ” are long gone .
after decades of actively participating in international economic institutions – including the g-20 , the international monetary fund , the world bank , and the world trade organization – china has begun to resemble a revisionist power seeking to create a new world order .
last month , china and 20 other asian countries signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a new multilateral development bank , the asian infrastructure investment bank .
progress on the single market has helped to boost competitiveness .
new free-trade agreements are giving european economies access to major markets around the world .
the achievement of a global climate agreement promises not just to protect the environment , but also to cement europe ’s role as a leader in sustainability .
and enlargement has enhanced europe ’s security substantially .
these are , by all reasonable standards , remarkable uk-led achievements .
a special report on semiconductors – essential to us national security and economic competitiveness – for president barack ’s obama ’s council of advisors on science and technology ( pcast ) provides some answers .
the report , written by a nonpartisan group of business and academic leaders ( i was a member ) , proposed that the us work with its allies to enforce international law , push china to comply with its world trade organization obligations , and strengthen export controls and inward investment restrictions .
the european union , japan , south korea , and taiwan all have prominent roles in the global supply chain for semiconductors , and some have already tightened security on the flow of semiconductor ip to china and on the acquisition of semiconductor companies by chinese investors .
the pcast report recommends that the us adopt similar tactics , calibrating export controls and inward investment limits according to china ’s behavior .
proposed bipartisan legislation to expand the jurisdiction of the committee on foreign investment in the us ( which reviews mergers and acquisitions of domestic companies by foreign entities ) to a broader range of investments – including chinese venture capital and private-equity investments in us start-ups – is consistent with this recommendation .
business-led innovation and market-based solutions can drive a decisive global shift from crippling fossil-fuel dependency to more efficient renewable-energy systems .
rocky mountain institute ’s reinventing fire analysis shows that such a future is possible , offering market-driven strategies for powering a us economy that is 158 % larger in 2050 – without reliance on oil , coal , or nuclear energy .
swift and determined action to make buildings more energy-efficient , design automobiles that require little or no fossil fuels , and increase the share of renewable energy in the electricity supply could ensure that the substantially hotter and less pleasant world of 2050 that the ipcc warns against does not materialize .
our livelihoods , not to mention those of future generations , should not be held hostage by our ongoing addiction to fossil fuels .
four decades ago , countries not only endured the immediate economic impact of the opec embargo ; they leveraged the potential of the resulting oil shortages to spur innovation .
the captured uranium was not weapons-grade ; international inspectors removed all sensitive material from iraq following the 1991 gulf war ( which is why it was absent when the united states invaded in 2003 ) .
but what international response , if any , would have been initiated if the cache had been highly enriched ?
on the same day , hamas launched three powerful iranian-designed rockets from gaza at israel ’s dimona reactor .
luckily , two missed the target , and israel managed to intercept the third .
but the episode represented a serious escalation of hostilities and served as an important reminder of the vulnerability of nuclear reactors in warzones .
although dollar appreciation has taken some pressure off non-us economies that depend on exports or foreign capital , it has increased the risk of an open currency war .
at the same time , not all indicators are grim .
labor markets remain largely healthy , even in otherwise anemic economies such as germany , and household consumption remains strong in most major economies .
in addition , the september surge in oil prices , which had raised concerns of another negative shock to growth , has since receded .
the us economy reflects this dichotomy .
in the personal-computing business – which moved from the bulky apple ii to the sleek and intelligent iphone 4s ( announced the day before steve ’s death ) – steve was the only true showman of what is now one of the world ’s biggest industries .
he inspired broad public enthusiasm for the quality of his products and his personal charisma .
( others have become “ business ” leaders , but only steve became someone known and admired by millions – including the romanian waiter at the british airways lounge where i am sitting now . )
i first met steve back in 1979 or 1980 , at ben rosen 's personal computer forum .
for some reason , it was held at the playboy resort in lake geneva ( never again ! ) .
cambridge – america ’s real gdp growth rate of 3.2 % for the first quarter of this year is impressive , as was the 3 % average growth in 2018 ( measured from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 ) .
since the end of the great recession – from 2011 to 2017 – the us economy grew by only 2.1 % per year , on average .
what accounts for the recent acceleration ?
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
in closed-list systems , the candidate lists should be zippered : male , female , male , female ( or vice versa ) .
in open-list systems , a 50 % quota should be adopted .
it is not possible to predict with any accuracy the impact of an increase in the quota percentages in the open-list systems that currently have effective quota legislation .
but if these countries replace their open lists with closed lists , the percentage of women elected should , all else remaining equal , increase by around 10 % .
the impact would be greatest ( resulting in an approximately 20 % jump in the percentage of women elected ) in systems that currently do not have effective quota legislation .
trump has systematically defied the separation of powers at the heart of the us constitutional system .
for example , frustrated that congress denied him all the funds he wanted for his phantasmagorical wall along the border with mexico , he simply plucked the money from funds that congress had allocated for the defense department .
he has also flouted the constitutional prohibition on accepting emoluments – money or personal benefits from foreign governments that do business , sometimes of extravagant proportion , at his various hotels and golf clubs – and has found other ways to monetize the presidency .
moreover , trump has tried to steer government contracts toward favored companies , or away from those he dislikes – for example , amazon , whose founder , jeff bezos , also owns the washington post .
and according to special counsel robert mueller ’s report , trump tried to obstruct the investigation into his 2016 campaign ’s dealings with russia .
when debt is unsustainable , there are several possible negotiating outcomes .
sometimes , debt-service payments are rescheduled and perhaps stretched out over a longer period , thus giving the debtor country time to regain its ability to pay .
sometimes , creditors agree to exchange the old bonds for new ones , which have either a lower face value or lower interest payments .
few governments refuse to pay at all in any form .
argentina defaulted on its debt in 2001 .
this ‘ tipping point ’ strategy is highly cost-effective . ”
however , a strategy can be “ cost-effective ” only if it is feasible .
although ring prophylaxis might work in minneapolis , toronto , or zurich , in the parts of the world where flu pandemics begin , the probability of success approaches zero .
in places like vietnam , indonesia , and china – where the pandemic strain will likely originate – expertise , coordination , discipline , and infrastructure are lacking .
the response in turkey – where as many as 50 possible cases have appeared in the eastern part of the country – is instructive .
it remains the vital assembly center of the global supply chain for many manufactured goods , such as computers and cell phones , enabling lower prices for the world ’s consumers .
that has made china a key trade partner for the united states , most european countries , and many other economies , in addition to placing it at the center of intra-asian trade and supply-chain dynamics .
moreover , china sits on roughly $ 3.3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves – much of it in dollars , but also in other major currencies – owing to its large trade surplus in recent decades .
it helps to finance other countries ’ trade deficits and domestic investment ( many of its beneficiaries have large budget deficits that decrease national saving below domestic investment ) .
deng xiaoping ’s reforms ignited the most rapid economic improvement in human history and , with it , the emergence of a large and growing middle class .
for ukraine ’s government , the angst is real .
even ukrainians born after 1986 understand what a chernobyl-type disaster brought about by battle could look like .
history offers little guidance as to whether warring countries would avoid damaging nuclear sites .
with the exception of the 1990 ’s balkan conflict , wars have not been fought against or within countries with nuclear reactors .
in the case of the balkans , serbian military jets overflew slovenia ’s krško nuclear power plant in a threatening gesture early in the conflict , while radical serbian nationalists called for attacks to release the radioactive contents .
china took full advantage of the kremlin ’s desperation , securing rock-bottom rates for russian energy resources .
once the door to asia was open , however , russian companies seized the opportunity to enter the downstream markets of india and indonesia – two countries that are critical to the saudis ’ own strategy .
over the last two years or so , saudi arabia has made starkly clear that it will not easily give up its market share – to anyone .
it has pursued a campaign to recover its former position not just in crude , but also in petroleum products , natural gas liquids , and petrochemicals .
to this end , it has sustained a price war , supported by a boost in production , aimed at pushing out weaker competitors .
indeed , attaining , prospering , and flourishing all refer to experiential rewards , not to money .
what sort of economy would offer this good life ?
history suggests that it would be one of entrepreneurial people ( alert to unnoticed opportunities , and exercising their initiative to try out new things ) and innovative people ( imagining new things , developing new concepts into commercial products and methods , and marketing them to potential ) .
the participants in such a good economy would range from the grassroots of society to the most advantaged .
this is the kind of economy i hope china will develop .
( though perhaps this is not automation proper – the supermarket has just shifted some of the work of shopping onto the customer . )
for those who dread the threat that automation poses to low-skilled labor , a ready answer is to train people for better jobs .
but technological progress is now eating up the better jobs , too .
a wide range of jobs that we now think of as skilled , secure , and irreducibly human may be the next casualties of technological change .
as a recent article in the financial times points out , in two areas notoriously immune to productivity increases , education and health care , technology is already reducing the demand for skilled labor .
in august , gunmen invaded the home of an impoverished roma widow , maria balogh , shot her to death , and wounded her 13-year-old daughter .
in april , killers gunned down a roma factory worker as he was walking to his job .
in february , a roma father and his five-year-old son were killed in front of their home near budapest .
the house was burned to the ground .
last november , a roma couple was killed in northeastern hungary .
a more rational approach would accept twenty-first-century realities .
the information revolution changed the world in ways that tariffs can not reverse .
with us workers already competing against robots at home , and against low-wage workers abroad , disrupting imports will just create more jobs for robots .
trump should be protecting individual workers , not individual jobs .
the processes of twenty-first-century globalization are too sudden , unpredictable , and uncontrollable to rely on static measures like tariffs .
he very probably means what he says about jews and israel , but is he a latter-day hitler , and is today ’s iran the equivalent of germany in the 1930 ’s ?
hitler came close to developing the nuclear bomb , but never had it , whereas iran very well might .
but hitler ’s power over germany was much more absolute than ahmadinejad ’s power over iran .
the results of iran ’s recent municipal elections were humiliating for ahmadinejad and his supporters .
those elections would have been unthinkable in nazi germany .
but this requires a rich reservoir of ideas , not a single , unified approach .
the second principle is subsidiarity , which holds that decision-making should be decentralized whenever possible .
this ensures that local and regional preferences are considered alongside the effects of eurozone-wide harmonization and economies of scale .
the last principle is congruity , to ensure that decision-makers are accountable for the outcomes of their decisions .
this means that as long as european electorates insist on retaining sovereignty over fiscal and economic policymaking , shared liability will be a pipe dream .
george w. bush ’s economic policies have been based on an extraordinarily reckless gamble that reflects a political coalition of two major forces : the super-rich and evangelical christians .
as those policies fail , global financial markets are reacting negatively , adding uncertainty to the world economy , and there is little relief in sight , because america is entering a period of prolonged political infighting and stalemate .
the super-rich had one over-riding objective in joining the bush coalition : tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest households .
evangelicals were brought in on the basis of so-called “ family values , ” meaning opposition to abortion and gay marriage , and promises of active government support for religious activities , including direct payments to religious groups for social services that they provide locally and internationally .
the bush team believed that they would eventually balance the tax cuts for the rich with reductions in government spending , but they never explained this to the public .
some large eu countries are on the brink of recession .
japan in the early 1990 ’s waited too long to act and missed the right opportunity to enact countermeasures , which is why japan has still not recovered from its long stagnation .
public investment in infrastructure ( such as a massive expansion of the european railroad network ) , as well as climate protection and environmental technology , will be needed .
to strengthen purchasing power and to stimulate consumption , tax cuts on low - and medium-income households are essential .
of course , eu member states should determine the concrete form that such economic stabilization programs take for themselves .
for europe , africa ’s economic potential remains far from tapped .
spending by households and businesses , estimated at $ 4 trillion in 2015 , is projected to reach $ 5.6 trillion by 2025 , reflecting 3.5 % annual growth .
moreover , according to the mckinsey global institute , investment opportunities stemming from infrastructure demand in africa will amount to at least $ 150 billion annually over the next decade .
africa is also home to strategic natural resources for emerging low-carbon industries , and is well positioned to play a key role in renewable energy .
africa ’s value as a trade and investment partner is not news to europe .
a far more competent placeholder would have been sergei ivanov , a former kgb general .
but ivanov is much taller than putin , who , at any rate , had only achieved the rank of colonel .
an obvious potential threat to putin ’s power , ivanov was passed over , and has since been relegated to the role of russia ’s “ chief botanist , ” overseeing the environment and transportation .
earlier this month , putin was re-inaugurated – or , rather , crowned – in spectacular fashion , with medvedev once again assuming the role of pliant prime minister .
despite his years in office , medvedev is still known more for his fancy ties and expensive watches than for his executive actions .
cambridge – government programs to support retirees are in trouble in every country , owing to increasing life expectancy and the rising ratio of retirees to taxpayers .
the problem will worsen in the years ahead as the adverse demographic trend increases the fiscal burden of funding pensions and health care .
the problem is uniquely different in the united states , because america ’s “ trust fund ” system of financing social security will create a crisis when the fund is exhausted .
though the options at that time will be different from the choices facing other governments , policies to avoid the us crisis are relevant to other countries that confront population aging .
here ’s how the us system works : by law , a payroll tax is dedicated exclusively to financing retiree benefits .
indeed , while the scandals have shaken the government , lula was overwhelmingly reelected last year , and investors continue to pour money into the stock market .
one reason is that the corruption scandals have provided an opportunity for investors to see brazilian freedom of speech and democracy in action .
newspapers and television commentators have been relentless in reporting the scandals , helping to prove to brazilians and foreign investors alike that the political system is sufficiently stable to withstand open criticism .
lula remains popular with brazilians because his populist rhetoric shows real sympathy with the less affluent , and with foreign investors because he has always tempered his radicalism to accommodate economic reality .
he recently criticized bolivian president evo morales ’s threats to seize foreign assets for his failure in this regard : “ radicalism is incompatible with the common sense needed from someone who governs . ”
the two organization of american states electoral observation missions that he himself had invited , and whose terms he had accepted , then refused to certify the outcome .
the bolivian military arrested no one .
true , morales resigned when the military told him to , and after he had agreed to protesters ’ demands for a new vote .
but the existing constitutional provisions were subsequently followed .
the constitutional court , which allowed morales to run , deemed the presidential succession legal ; timely elections have been promised ; and the military have not taken power .
and they resent – to the point of mobilizing in the streets – any hint that a clique at the top is barring their way .
this is a sort of free democratic spirit that operates outside the convention that elections decide the government .
it is fueled enormously by social media ( itself a revolutionary phenomenon ) .
and it moves very fast in precipitating crisis .
it is not always consistent or rational .
countries were required to undertake only limited trade liberalization , with plenty of exceptions for socially sensitive sectors ( agriculture , textiles , services ) .
this left them free to build their own versions of national capitalism , as long as they obeyed a few simple international rules .
the current crisis shows how far we have come from that model .
financial globalization , in particular , played havoc with the old rules .
when chinese-style capitalism met american-style capitalism , with few safety valves in place , it gave rise to an explosive mix .
so , even if america had no other interests in the middle east , such as israel or nuclear non-proliferation , a balance of energy imports and exports would be unlikely to free the us from military expenditures – which some experts estimate run to $ 50 billion per year – to protect oil routes in the region .
at the same time , america ’s bargaining position in world politics should be enhanced .
power arises from asymmetries in interdependence .
you and i may depend on each other , but if i depend on you less than you do on me , my bargaining power is increased .
for decades , the us and saudi arabia have had a balance of asymmetries in which we depended on them as the swing producer of oil , and they depended on us for ultimate military security .
european commission president jean-claude juncker , for example , openly frets about the deep divisions among eu member states over brexit and questions whether “ the hungarians and the poles want exactly the same things as the germans and the french . ”
at the national level , lack of political will has resulted in the craven use of referenda , such as the french and dutch plebiscites on the treaty establishing a constitution for europe in 2005 , the netherlands ’ vote on the eu-ukraine association agreement last april , and the brexit referendum nearly three months later .
in every case , voters said , “ no ” – outcomes that can be blamed , particularly in the uk , on national leaders ’ habit of blaming the eu for domestic problems .
indeed , european leaders ’ parochialism is a major reason why the eu is failing to retain broad-based public support .
the lack of historical vision among the current generation of political leadership undermines the shared sense of purpose needed to make eu citizens feel that they are part of the same community , regardless of their different national identities .
florence – british politics has always been something of an experimental laboratory for the industrialized world .
in the 1970 ’s , britain was where the preeminent postwar model of how to manage the economy collapsed .
that model had been based politically on the creation of consensus , and economically on keynesian demand management .
today , the equivalent collapse has been of the “ regulation-lite ” regime in which a party that styled itself as “ new labour ” accepted a powerful role for markets – particularly for largely deregulated financial markets .
in the 1960 ’s , keynesian policies delivered the illusion that everyone was benefiting , with high levels of employment and significant wage growth .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
palestine ’s religious landmarks attract increasing numbers of religious tourists from all over the world each year .
as french cities have burned , other countries have been very severe in judging france .
embassies have issued warnings to tourists and their citizens living in france ; television news programs have shown hours of footage of burning cars .
other countries ’ governments , it seems , have been trying to distance themselves from the problem , fearing a contagion that they know is likely to spread .
mayors across europe , however , have responded more moderately , feeling and showing solidarity with the plight of their french colleagues .
they know that their cities are also vulnerable to urban violence , in so far as they have pockets of social inequality , including marginalized and excluded young people .
meanwhile , the supply of most commodities is forecast to grow by no more than 2 % annually in real terms .
all else being equal , unless china ’s commodity intensity , defined as the amount of a commodity consumed to generate a unit of output , falls dramatically , its demand for commodities will be greater this year than it was last year .
as long as china ’s commodity demand grows at a higher rate than global supply , prices will rise .
and the rapid economic growth that china ’s leaders must sustain in order to lift enormous numbers of people out of poverty – and thus prevent a crisis of legitimacy – places a floor under global food , energy , and mineral prices .
to be sure , intensity of use has fallen for some commodities , like gold and nuclear energy ; but for others , such as aluminum and coal , it has risen since 2000 or , as is the case for copper and oil , declines have slowed markedly or stalled at high levels .
he was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year and had to launch a social-media campaign to locate the drugs that his treatment required .
severe shortages of life-saving drugs in venezuela are the result of the government ’s default on a $ 3.5 billion bill for pharmaceutical imports .
a similar situation prevails throughout the rest of the economy .
payment arrears on food imports amount to $ 2.4 billion , leading to a substantial shortage of staple goods .
in the automobile sector , the default exceeds $ 3 billion , leading to a collapse in transport services as a result of a lack of spare parts .
will it have to get the bomb , too ?
likewise , while egypt is in the midst of a messy revolution , and must give priority to internal change , it also intends to regain a more visible and influential role within the palestinian national movement ( s ) and in the region as a whole .
the “ middle empire ” of the middle east will no longer remain a sleeping giant .
of course , turkey is less destabilized than its arab rivals and partners by a revolutionary process that does not directly challenge it .
after all , turkey is already a functioning democracy .
if " constitutionalized " , they simply implant the idea that the constitution is a statement of aspirations , rather than a set of enforceable legal rights .
the desire to limit or protect some forms of human activity from the free market may be understandable , particularly in countries like poland where the free market is still an unknown animal .
but in a situation where many fields of social life -- such as education , health , and social services -- need quick and radical change , unleashing the free market to do its work offers the only plausible avenue for change .
state-owned health insurance companies , state guaranteed retirement , etc. are not only insecure and inefficient ; they are also contrary to the idea of political reform .
these state controlled benefits have little to do with the justice supposedly wanted by their socialist promoters , but everything to do with rent-seeking and corruption .
the movies of bollywood , which is bringing its glitzy entertainment far beyond the indian diaspora in the united states and the united kingdom , offer another example .
a senegalese friend told me of his illiterate mother who takes a bus to dakar every month to watch a bollywood film – she does n’t understand the hindi dialogue and ca n’t read the french subtitles , but she can still catch the spirit of the films and understand the story , and people like her look at india with stars in their eyes as a result .
an indian diplomat in damascus a few years ago told me that the only publicly displayed portraits as big as those of then-president hafez al-assad were of the bollywood superstar amitabh bachchan .
indian art , classical music and dance have the same effect .
so does the work of indian fashion designers , now striding across the world ’s runways .
new delhi – barack obama , the sixth american president to visit india since it gained independence , arrives at a trying time , both for the united states and for india .
some of obama ’s closest advisers have just resigned , opening an awkward gap on national security and the economy – the focus of his meetings with india ’s government .
for india , the issues on the agenda for obama ’s visit are immense and complex , and the options for resolving them are extremely limited .
those related to security in afghanistan and pakistan are as treacherous as they have ever been .
bilateral economic , trade , and currency disagreements may not be as bitter as they are between the us and china , but they are thorny , and lack of resolution is making them more intractable .
moreover , knowledge-intensive technology has a winner-take-all network effect , whereby hubs seize access to knowledge and power , leaving less-privileged groups , classes , sectors , and regions struggling to compete .
thanks to social media , the resulting discontent now spreads faster than ever , leading to destructive politics .
this can invite geopolitical interference , which quickly deteriorates into a lose-lose scenario , like that already apparent in water-stressed and conflict-affected countries , where governments are fragile or failing .
the combination of bad politics and economics in one country can easily produce contagion , as rising migration spreads political stress and instability to other countries .
according to the un high commission for refugees , there were 65 million refugees last year , compared to just 1.6 million in 1960 .
many have cited former british prime minister david cameron ’s decision to allow scotland ’s independence referendum to take place in 2014 .
but such a process is illegal under the spanish constitution of 1978 .
that constitution marked the country ’s passage from dictatorship to democracy and provides the framework for spain ’s rule-of-law system .
and , as it explicitly states , it is “ based on the indissoluble unity of the spanish nation , ” with sovereignty belonging “ to the spanish people . ”
in short , spain is one nation , indivisible .
geneva – the world needs to stop looking backward .
since the 2008 financial crisis , we have wasted far too much energy trying to return to the days of rapid economic expansion .
the flawed assumption that the post-crisis world 's challenges were only temporary has underpinned policies that have yielded only lackluster recoveries , while failing to address key problems like high unemployment and rising inequality .
the post-crisis era is over , and the “ post-post-crisis world " is upon us .
it is time to adopt a new framework of realistic solutions that promote shared prosperity within the global economy of today and tomorrow .
indeed , it is notable that , while obama ’s state of the union address in january 2010 at least mentioned doha , his address in january 2011 did not .
obama confined himself to promoting the pending bilateral agreements with colombia and other emerging-market countries .
obama ’s regrettable retreat from support for the doha round is the result of many factors and fallacies .
these were highlighted in an “ open letter to obama ” that i organized and released , over the signatures of nearly 50 of today ’s most influential trade experts worldwide , urging a presidential shift in policy towards doha .
america ’s president is captive to the country ’s labor unions , who buy the false narrative that trade with poor countries is increasing the ranks of the poor in the us by driving down wages .
some people even predict a double-dip recession .
if that happens , the chance of an actual us default would be much higher than it is today .
these new worries are raising alarm bells in china .
diversification away from dollar assets is the advice of the day .
but this is no easy task , particularly in the short term .
berkeley – investors worldwide are increasingly seeking investment opportunities that promise to bring environmental and social benefits , in addition to market rates of return .
if this trend continues , with the advancement of environmental or social objectives enhancing an investment ’s value , it will strengthen the commitment to sustainability that is already gaining momentum among businesses around the world .
last year , one out of every six dollars of assets under professional management in the united states – a total of $ 6.6 trillion – was allocated toward some form of sustainable investment , especially public equities .
some 1,260 companies , managing $ 45 trillion worth of assets , are signatories of the united nations ’ “ principles for responsible investment , ” which recognize environmental , social , and governance ( esg ) factors – and thus the long-term health and stability of companies and markets – as critical to investors .
one signatory , calpers , one of the world ’s largest institutional investors , has gone a step further : it will require all of its investment managers to identify and integrate esg factors into their decisions – a bold move that could transform capital markets .
in international politics , perceptions matter – sometimes even more than reality .
the perception today is that america ’s unipolar moment has come to an end ; europe is on the decline ; and a new set of powers is rising , bringing their own unique worldviews to global affairs .
in a sense , this might seem like a good thing .
more varied perspectives could enrich multilateral processes and generate more comprehensive solutions to global problems .
but this multipolar dynamic also generates instability .
some supermarket chains even ceased to carry eggs from battery hens .
in britain and some european countries , animal welfare became politically salient , and pressure on parliamentary representatives mounted .
the european union established a scientific committee to investigate animal-welfare issues on farms , and the committee recommended banning the battery cage , along with some other forms of close confinement of pigs and calves .
a ban on battery cages in the eu was eventually adopted in 1999 , but , to ensure that producers would have plenty of time to phase out the equipment in which they had invested , its implementation was delayed until january 1 , 2012 .
to its credit , the british egg industry accepted the situation , and developed new and less cruel methods of keeping hens .
finally , the same accounts could serve as vehicles for public policy .
for example , early school-leavers could be endowed with points for later use in professional training .
more broadly , instead of assisting people only when social risks materialize , public policy could support individuals throughout their working life , by adopting a more effective bespoke approach that fits peoples ’ needs better than coarsely tailored schemes .
this may sound utopian ; in a way , it is .
but at a time when every digital service becomes more and more personalized , why should social policy remain confined to the philosophy and solutions of the twentieth century ?
it used to be that even mentioning corruption in some official circles was considered taboo .
but corruption poses the single largest obstacle to growth and development in many countries , especially as it diverts resources from the poor .
the world bank insisted that corruption be seen as a cancer , and that fighting it be made synonymous with fighting poverty .
indeed , outspokenness was a hallmark of wolfensohn ’s tenure .
many a government minister , bank officer and ngo representative has experienced his blunt criticism , as well as his effusive praise .
the formation of the g-20 , for example , was an improvisation designed to defer genuine financial reform .
in fact , the modest measures implemented in response to the changing distribution of global power have been limited to the economic realm , with the hard core of international relations – peace and security – remaining the exclusive preserve of a handful of countries .
china is not on the same page as the other brics countries when it comes to global institutional reform .
it is a revisionist power concerning the global financial architecture , seeking an overhaul of the bretton woods system .
but it is a status quo power with respect to the united nations system , and steadfastly opposes enlargement of the security council ’s permanent membership .
it can lead to gridlock , conflict , or poor policy choices .
the evidence supports the view that the systematic exclusion of subgroups on any arbitrary basis ( for example , ethnicity , race , or religion ) is particularly damaging in this respect .
intergenerational mobility is a key indicator of equality of opportunity .
rising inequality of outcomes need not lead to reduced intergenerational mobility .
whether it does depends heavily on whether important instruments that support equality of opportunity , principally education and health care , are universally accessible .
the proliferation of information technology and social media means that it is easier than ever for entrepreneurs to tap into a large pool of finance – not to mention contacts and expertise – from small investors .
of the roughly 500 crowdfunding platforms that now exist , several specifically target clean technologies .
last may , eureeca.com took the crowdfunding concept further than ever , creating the first truly global crowd-investing marketplace that offers equity in funded companies .
if used wisely , such platforms could take up the slack created by governments ’ fiscal constraints to facilitate the entrepreneurial innovations needed to build the blue economy .
other increasingly prominent trends – such as collaborative consumption , pay per use , and sharing and leasing models – could offer similarly powerful impetus to these efforts .
bangladesh knows wartime cholera all too well .
in 1971 , fighting broke out when bangladesh , then known as east pakistan , declared independence from pakistan .
in the ensuing conflict , refugees poured across the border into neighboring india into crowded camps , creating conditions that inevitably gave rise to cholera outbreaks .
the standard of care at the time was poor , and a dearth of intravenous drips meant that rehydration solutions could not be administered widely .
as many people lay dying , a pioneering doctor named dilip mahalanabis took a chance in a desperate situation .
madrid – april 22 , 2017 – international earth day – marks one year since the signing of the paris climate agreement , which entered into force last november , and now has 195 signatories .
that landmark multilateral treaty still represents the most important step forward to date in the global fight against climate change .
but its first anniversary has been darkened by us president donald trump ’s energy policies .
in 2016 , the hottest year on record , average global temperatures were 0.9 º c above the twentieth-century average .
the paris agreement ’s main objective is to prevent average world temperatures from rising more than 2º c above pre-industrial levels by 2100 .
the atheistic nature of today ’s civilization ( ours is the first atheistic civilization in the history of humankind and also the first civilization that embraces the whole planet ) coincides deeply , i believe , with the hypertrophic pursuit of individual interests and individual responsibilities together with the crisis of global responsibilities .
could the fact that humanity thinks only within the limits of what lies in its field of vision , and is incapable of remembering also what lies beyond , not but be the result of the loss of metaphysical certitude , of the loss of god ?
even more succinctly , could not today ’s crisis of responsibility and accountability for the world as a whole and for its future be the logical consequence of the modern concept of the world as controlled by scientifically identifiable laws , formulated for god-knows - what purpose -- that is , a concept which does not question or seek the deeper meaning of existence and renounces any and all metaphysics ?
but how to restore in the human mind a shared attitude to what is above us if people across the globe have a different image of that which is above , if people everywhere feel the need to stress their " otherness " ?
is there any sense in trying to turn the human mind to the heavens when such a turn would only aggravate the conflicts on earth among the followers of our various deities ?
he has thrown down the gauntlet to the world ’s major economies : tell us when you will phase out coal , end harmful fossil-fuel subsidies , and shift taxation from income to pollution .
those are the decisions that will drivethe transformation the world needs .
at the heart of this transformation is the energy transition , which , although underway , is lagging or has stalled in many parts of the world .
a more ambitious effort by energy providers and major end users is critical , as is extending affordable and reliable clean-energy services to all who need them .
there also needs to be a major reform of how the transition is financed .
new haven – central bankers around the world failed to see the current financial crisis coming before its beginnings in 2007 .
martin čihák of the international monetary fund reported in july 2007 that , of 47 central banks found to publish financial stability reports ( fsrs ) , “ virtually all ” gave a “ positive overall assessment of their domestic financial system ” in their most recent reports .
and yet , although these central banks failed us before the crisis , they should still play the lead role in preventing the next crisis .
that is the conclusion , perhaps counterintuitive , that the squam lake group [ http://squamlakegroup.org/ ] , a think tank of 15 academic financial economists to which i belong , reached in our recently published report , fixing the financial system .
macro-prudential regulators ( government officials who focus not on the soundness of individual financial institutions , but rather on the stability of the whole financial system ) are sorely needed , and central bankers are the logical people to fill this role .
while vowing during the presidential campaign to end daca , he also acknowledged the moral case to be made for maintaining it , saying that he would be faced by a “ very , very hard ” choice .
and even after the repeal was announced , he declared that he wanted to “ resolve the daca issue with heart and compassion . ”
yet , apparently convinced that daca beneficiaries have taken jobs away from citizens , he concluded that the same heart and compassion were needed “ for unemployed , struggling , and forgotten americans . ”
sadly , in making this choice , the president has opted to turn away from the classic american vision engraved on the pedestal of the statue of liberty in new york harbor , expressed in emma lazarus ’s poem , which begins , “ give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free . ”
that credo has benefited tens of millions of newcomers , and it has immeasurably strengthened america .
they want oil and mining concessions to be allocated efficiently and to maximize government revenue .
trying to accomplish these valuable tasks while paying below-market salaries is penny wise but pound foolish .
tax collectors , regulators , and prosecutors need adequate resources to win their difficult battles .
amlo ’s decision to lower the wages of public employees has already led many high-ranking officials to seek employment elsewhere .
those who are entitled to early retirement are taking it , rather than waiting for amlo ’s cut .
moreover , global co2 emissions reached a record high in 2012 .
and the international energy agency reports that global temperatures are on track to rise to 3.6-5.3 ° celsius ( 6.5-9.5 ° fahrenheit ) above pre-industrial levels – far more than the two degrees that climate scientists have identified as the threshold beyond which the most disastrous consequences of climate change would be triggered .
clearly , the third industrial revolution needs help .
in order to accelerate the pace of energy-related innovation , creative coalitions among governments , private firms , and civil-society groups should be established in three main areas .
the first coalition , comprising a group of committed governments , would seek to drive down the cost of renewable energy at least to that of fossil-fuel energy within a decade .
sao paulo – as well-intentioned gestures go , earth hour is hard to beat .
at the stroke of 8:30 p.m. on saturday , march 27 , nearly a billion people in more than 120 countries demonstrated their desire to do something about global warming by switching off their lights for an hour .
in a show of official solidarity , the lights also went out at many of the planet ’s most iconic landmarks , from the opera house in sydney to the great pyramid at giza , not to mention beijing ’s forbidden city , new york ’s empire state building , london ’s big ben , paris ’s eiffel tower , and the skylines of both hong kong and las vegas .
what ever else it may be , earth hour is surely one of the most successful publicity stunts ever dreamed up .
first organized in sydney , australia , in 2007 by the local chapter of the world wildlife fund , its popularity and the level of participation ( both individual and official ) that generates has exploded in recent years – to the point that there is barely a corner of the earth that the campaign has n’t touched .
essentially , the british point of view has been that a loose confederation of nation-states cooperating on trade is as much europe as the uk needs .
but britain joined the european community , not just the free-trade area that cameron now apparently wants .
nonetheless , the undertow of euro-skepticism in british politics has never diminished and was evident in cameron ’s speech .
even the supremacy of european law in defined areas was accepted only reluctantly by britain , and long after many others had done so .
indeed , in his speech , cameron could not resist a passing shot at the european court of justice .
coal-fired power is also the main source of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change , which causes about 150,000 premature deaths annually and threatens pervasive risks this century and beyond .
to be sure , the coal industry has helped billions of people escape poverty , not least in china , where coal-fired power has underpinned the nearly 700 % growth in per capita income since 1990 .
but human health is at greater risk in countries that burn more coal .
research for the global commission on the economy and climate last year calculated that particulate matter alone caused 1.23 million premature deaths in china – the world ’s top coal-consuming economy – in 2010 .
estimates for 2012 suggest that 88 % of air-pollution-related deaths occur in low - to middle-income countries , representing 82 % of the world ’s population .
but sometimes this desire seems overwhelming in post-modern democracies everywhere .
indeed , democracy nowadays has embraced a pop culture of rapidly passing fads ; today 's hysteria-generating pop group is forgotten tomorrow , and there are always more waiting in the wings .
in politics this can be dangerous , because it encourages basing decisions , no matter how weighty , on whatever popular opinion momentarily prevails .
the call for more referenda both reflects and fuels this trend .
referenda are for the most part snapshots .
she could , perhaps , say “ message for president obama ” if she were sharing an open letter , but otherwise …
the best subject line says what the message is about and signals the desired response : “ invitation to speak in paris on july 14 . ”
or , “ investment proposal for your consideration , ” or , “ serve as a reference ? ”
unfortunately , i get lots of messages headlined , “ update . ”
unless i know the person ’s name , i might not even know what company it ’s about .
and yet changes currently afoot might just turn things around .
india ’s octogenarian prime minister , manmohan singh , has recently awakened to the desperate need for renewed momentum .
economists around the world have taken note of the arrival of raghuram rajan as chief economist in the finance ministry .
rajan is a superstar academic researcher , a brilliant writer on political economy , and a former chief economist for the imf .
but it is far from obvious that sonia gandhi , president of the indian national congress and the country ’s most powerful politician , shares singh ’s reform agenda .
we must abandon popper ’s tacit assumption that political discourse aims at a better understanding of reality and reintroduce it as an explicit requirement .
the separation of powers , free speech , and free elections alone can not ensure open society ; a strong commitment to the pursuit of truth is also required .
we need to introduce new ground rules for political discourse .
these can not be identi­cal to scientific method , but they should be similar in character , enshrining the pursuit of truth as the criteria on which political views are to be judged .
politicians will respect , rather than manipulate , reality only if the public cares about the truth and punishes politicians when it catches them in deliber­ate deception .
why do indian athletes perform so badly ?
the explanations range from the anthropological to the borderline racist : indians do n’t have the genes , the build , the stamina , the climate , whatever .
there are structural and infrastructural explanations : lack of training facilities , gymnasiums , running tracks , equipment , financial resources .
we are a developing country , it is said ; after all , it is not just your eye against his , your legs against hers , but what you can do against their trainer , their running shoe , their ergodynamic costume , their titanium archer ’s bow .
but those rationales wo n’t do : other developing countries , from jamaica to ethiopia , regularly rake in the medals .
as early as january 1998 , the neoconservative project for a new american century ( pnac ) sent a letter to then-president bill clinton urging him to topple saddam hussein .
and , after winning the presidency in 2000 , bush declared iraq one of his top two security priorities .
not coincidentally , bush ’s administration included ten of the 25 signatories of the pnac founding statement of principles , including dick cheney as vice president and donald rumsfeld as secretary of defense .
soon enough , the bush administration became obsessed with promoting the idea that iraq had weapons of mass destruction , despite the absence of any conclusive evidence .
in september 2002 , rumsfeld received a now-declassified intelligence report stating that , “ we do n’t know with any precision how much we do n’t know ” about the “ status of wmd programs ” in iraq .
the greatest difference between 2009 and 1979 was created by the revolution itself .
r evolutions give birth to a new political class , and iran ’s islamic revolution was no exception .
the iranian leadership formed after the revolution consisted of a narrow ruling stratum and a much broader supporting group that was given charge of administration and political mobilization .
in the 20 years since khomeini ’s death , the composition of this political class has changed drastically .
the clerical elite has gradually lost power to the military-security groups , from whose ranks president mahmoud ahmadinejad emerged .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
but we should not exaggerate the importance of this point .
research shows that many girls around the world – and especially those in the global south – are simply not prepared for menarche ; education can help .
finally , we need solutions that are based on facts .
too often , biased assumptions guide policymaking .
when programs are developed in conjunction with rigorous research , the effect can be dramatic .
for example , a joint soas-oxford study on menstruation in uganda found that adolescent girls often missed school because they did n’t have access to clean sanitary products .
economists have long understood that , in the absence of a credible lender of last resort , banks are vulnerable to self-fulfilling confidence crises .
that lender can be monetary or fiscal , and in greece both types are in doubt .
if greece ’s agreement with the eu and the imf unravels , the european central bank will no longer accept greek bonds as collateral .
and the greek state does not have the wherewithal to stand behind its banks .
in these circumstances , it would be more surprising if depositors were not rushing to pull their funds out of greek banks .
russia , almost entirely dependent on revenues from its energy resources , is a “ one crop economy ” with corrupt institutions and insurmountable demographic and health problems .
president vladimir putin ’s interventions in neighboring countries and the middle east , and his cyber attacks on the us and others , though intended to make russia look great again , merely worsen the country ’s long-term prospects .
in the short run , however , declining countries often take more risks and are thus more dangerous – witness the austro-hungarian empire in 1914 .
this has created a policy dilemma .
on the one hand , it is important to resist putin ’s game-changing challenge to the post-1945 liberal order ’s prohibition on the use of force by states to seize territory from their neighbors .
preventing the eu from falling apart will require , first and foremost , a strategic solution to the greek crisis .
greece needs both money and reforms – rapidly and within the eurozone and the eu .
the governments in athens , brussels , and even berlin can not live with greece as a failed state and economy .
the continuing poker game between the greek government and the troika ( the european commission , the european central bank , and the international monetary fund ) hurts all parties involved – and europe most of all .
it can ultimately end only with a renewed bailout of greece or with europe ’s plunge into disaster .
indeed , china ’s rise has provided a new orbit for many countries around the world – particularly developing and emerging economies .
and indeed , china ’s exceptional diplomatic skill across the african continent ( and , increasingly , southeast asia ) has made it an alternative hegemonic force – one that comes without the west ’s colonial baggage or moralizing about democracy and human rights .
trump ’s presidency provides china with new opportunities to cement its role as a provider of investment and all manner of infrastructure and assistance to a host of countries eager to develop .
his unilateralist approach is likely to force the us into playing catch-up with a china left almost unfettered in its continued efforts to win over the hearts and minds of those whose countries it views as vital , economically and politically , to its strategic interests .
as trump embraces isolationism , the other so-called brics countries – brazil , russia , india , and south africa – are preparing to fill the vacuum as well .
austin – living in a city turns you into a cannibal .
that , at least , is the metaphor preferred by jean-jacques rousseau , who considered cities a pit of human corruption .
rousseau was so convinced of the malign effects of urbanization that he “ would rather see men grazing on meadow grass than devouring each other in cities . ”
urbanization inures people to the suffering of the countryside , and as townspeople crowd together , their capacity for compassion toward others atrophies .
urbanites become the kind of people who are ready to sacrifice one another to satisfy their appetites : cannibals .
looking ahead to the 2021-2030 period , an annual growth rate of 8 % ( compared to the 10 % rate of the past decade ) , and a gradual increase of consumption to 50 % of gdp , would translate into chinese consumer spending of $ 18.4 trillion per year by 2030 .
in this scenario , chinese consumption would surpass that of the us in dollar terms .
the question at the start of 2019 , then , is what it will mean for the global economy if this scenario does not play out .
if apple ’s recent guidance points to an across-the-board , indefinite reduction in chinese consumption , will american consumers be able to serve as the sole engine of the global economy for yet another decade ?
if not , could any other country fill this role , even partially ?
at least four “ mismatches ” lay at the root of past global financial crises , and three of them plague china today .
first , with its bank-dominated financial system , china ( along with europe and many emerging economies ) suffers from a maturity mismatch , owing to short-term borrowing and long-term lending .
yet , unlike many emerging economies , china does not struggle with a currency mismatch , thanks to its large foreign-exchange reserves and persistent current-account surpluses , which make it a net lender to the rest of the world .
but china has not avoided the third mismatch , between debt and equity : the credit-to-gdp ratio doubled over the last decade , from about 110 % in 2008 to 220 % in 2017 , highlighting china ’s under-developed long-term capital and equity markets .
nor can policymakers afford to ignore the fourth mismatch – between ultra-low nominal interest rates and the relatively higher risk-adjusted return on equity ( roe ) for investors – which has contributed to speculative investment and widening wealth and income inequality .
with a target of 20 gw of solar generating capacity by 2020 , investment in india could grow rapidly .
the events of the past 15 months – starting with the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico , followed by the violence in north africa and the tragedy in japan – confront the world with a stark choice between the costs and risks of traditional energy sources and the promise and progress of clean energy .
in recent decades , europe has been a driving force for energy modernization .
in the years ahead , such leadership will be needed to help capture the economic , environmental , and security benefits of renewable energy .
reaffirming its commitment to rapid decarbonization of its energy system , and to creative policies in support of that goal , will help europe continue to reap the rewards of one of the most remarkable new market opportunities in living memory .
even in the absence of tariffs and quotas , trade can be impeded by subsidies , taxes , anti-dumping legislation , restrictions on foreign direct investment , and exchange-rate manipulation .
for example , protectionism often masquerades as labor , food , environmental , and phytosanitary standards , or as arguments for local content requirements , infant industries , protections for intellectual property , climate policies , dispute resolution , or human rights .
human ingenuity appears to know no bounds when it comes to dreaming up protectionist barriers .
in october 1982 , the french government required that all japanese vcr imports enter the country through poitiers , a town hundreds of miles from the nearest significant shipping port .
this non-tariff barrier to trade remained in effect until april 1983 .
washington , dc – to defeat populism requires coming to grips with a fundamental reality : bad economic policies no longer necessarily result in a government losing power .
in fact , it is now entirely possible that irresponsible populists may actually strengthen their chances of being re-elected by making wilder and more impossible promises – and by causing more economic damage .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
the financial sector has since made every effort to design instruments that protect against price fluctuations , to transform private debt into tradable financial securities , and to gain access to speculative markets .
but these efforts were conducive to fraud and delinquency , and thus spurred a wave of new financial crises – in europe in 1992 , in asia in 1997 , and in russia in 1998 – as well as a recession in europe and the united states in the early 2000 ’s .
two other destabilizing developments emerged in the last quarter of the twentieth century : a strong incentive to use debt to prop up demand , and a shift toward financing public debt through private institutions at market prices , under the pretext of fighting inflation .
these trends boosted public-debt burdens , while flooding the global financial system with liquidity generated by private banking activities that were unconnected to transactions in the real economy .
as a result , by 2006 , global liquidity amounted to more than twice the value of world gdp .
similarly , the united kingdom established a cost-review program that identified 40 major projects for prioritization , reformed overall planning processes , and then created a cabinet sub-committee to ensure faster delivery of projects , thereby cutting infrastructure spending by 15 % .
and chile ’s national public investment system evaluates all proposed public projects using standard forms , procedures , and metrics – and rejects as many as 35 % .
additional opportunities for savings – to the tune of $ 400 billion annually – lie in more streamlined delivery of infrastructure projects .
there is massive scope to accelerate approvals and land acquisition , structure contracts to encourage innovation and savings , and improve collaboration with contractors .
in australia , the state of new south wales cut approval times by 11 % in just one year .
you soon will be able to .
other categories include business ( with entities such as employers , industries , and employees ) , biology , space flight , and many more , and include representations – such as graphs , timelines , and tables – of how they are connected .
most things do n’t exist in isolation .
they have complex relationships to other things , and by representing that information using verbs – for example , “ the company that google acquired ” vs. “ the company that google competes with ” – we can represent the world more accurately .
and that means better , more meaningful responses when we search .
the european union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women – up to 60 % .
this proposed mandate was born of frustration .
last year , european commission vice president viviane reding issued a call to voluntary action .
reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goals of 40 % female board membership .
the forte foundation in america has now followed suit with its own list of “ board-ready women . ”
cambridge – at the beginning of classes every autumn , i tease my students with the following question : is it better to be poor in a rich country or rich in a poor country ?
the question typically invites considerable and inconclusive debate .
but we can devise a more structured and limited version of the question , for which there is a definitive answer .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
she saved because she wanted enough money to retire .
given the terrible returns on savings since 2007 , the prospect of continuing low interest rates might make her put even more money aside .
alternatively , low interest rates could push her ( or her pension fund ) to buy risky long-maturity bonds .
given that these bonds are already aggressively priced , such a move might thus set her up for a fall when interest rates eventually rise .
indeed , america may well be in the process of adding a pension crisis to the unemployment problem .
certainly , the zambians ’ achievement can not compete with the intervention in libya or the drama of the arab spring .
and yet , what happened in zambia is related to those developments – and thus relevant everywhere .
what made zambia ’s election so important is that the challenger won .
indeed , he defeated an incumbent who really wanted to keep his job , and who might reasonably have been tempted to follow the lead of other african leaders defeated in a popular vote by simply refusing to accept the result .
after all , smooth transitions of power are not to be taken for granted .
russia ’s diplomatic weaknesses have been starkly apparent in syria .
its use of hard power won the civil war for president bashar al-assad ’s dictatorship , showing how the strategic deployment of unrestrained military force – witness the utter destruction of aleppo – can be a game-changer .
but russia has since become mired in local rivalries between syria and turkey , saudi arabia and iran , turkey and the kurds , and israel and iran .
while a policy of neutrality has enabled russia to maintain a dialogue with the various sides , it will do nothing to create a new regional order .
as it stands , syria is russia ’s only client state in the middle east .
with the external debt trimmed by rescheduling , foreign capital flowed in once again .
investors were willing to buy even 100-year bonds from a country with eight sovereign defaults in the last two centuries .
investor enthusiasm , and the domestic political honeymoon , lasted as long as the international environment remained benign .
but when inflows faltered in 2018 , the imf had to step in once again , closing the external funding gap with a stunning $ 50 billion loan program ( later raised to $ 57 billion ) .
but , again , the external funding problem was not a temporary phenomenon , and the argentinian electorate soon began to bristle at the reforms demanded by the imf .
moreover , alternative approaches to stimulate private demand might have fewer undesirable distributional consequences , as mgi has discussed .
proponents of helicopter money – directly crediting citizens with central bank funds , or crediting national treasuries to finance infrastructure and other demand-generating activities – rightly argue that it has the advantage of putting money directly into the hands of those who will spend it .
an appropriately sized helicopter-money program might also raise inflation in a measured way , heading off the possibility of a japanese-style deflationary trap .
indeed , the boost to demand might give central banks the opening they need to move interest rates back toward historical norms .
this could take the air out of incipient assets bubbles that might be forming and ease pressures on institutional investors who are struggling to find the yield they need to meet their insurance and pension commitments .
this followed two visits he made to haiti over the past 18 months and a donor ’s conference he sponsored in april that sought to raise $ 300 million in aid and investment .
more recently , ban took an active role in the gaza crisis .
he has regularly defended the palestinians ’ rights to a state , but he also condemned hamas ’s rocket attacks on southern israel .
during the fighting in gaza , he publicly demanded a halt to the warfare and requested that israel open gaza ’s borders to relief aid .
he also visited the un compound in the center of gaza to express the un ’s grave concern over its bombing .
according to the international monetary fund ’s april 2011 world economic outlook , though the volatility of capital flows has increased worldwide , it is higher in emerging market economies than in advanced economies .
boom-bust financial cycles are driven largely by shocks generated in advanced economies , but they are key determinants of emerging markets ’ business cycles .
moreover , the spillover effects of advanced economies ’ monetary policies extend beyond financial shocks .
emerging economies are also suffering from the effects of developed countries ’ external imbalances – particularly the eurozone ’s swelling current-account surplus .
in the last few years , the deficit economies of the eurozone ’s periphery – and , more recently , italy – have undertaken massive external adjustments , while germany and the netherlands have sustained their large surpluses .
first , the unrivaled dominance of egypt ’s military , and the unlikelihood of a split in its leadership , makes any extensive violence untenable , especially given that the egyptian state ’s fight against terrorism in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s significantly weakened jihadist groups ’ operational assets in the country .
second , the powerful forces of political islam may now be carried away by passions , wrath , and a sense of victimization ; but they will inevitably opt to participate in domestic politics through organized structures and processes .
in a country with more than 45 million people under 35 years old , no political player with any strategic insight can afford a prolonged impasse .
finally , despite the significant demographic and economic changes in egypt during the last four decades , egyptian society still retains its agrarian character , which favors conciliation and compromise .
but , even in an inclusive political transition , whether in the short or medium term , egyptians will have to answer the vexing question that they have failed for six decades to confront : what is egypt ?
a factor that contributed to their demise was a shift in thinking that transformed the conflict between east and west away from one that emphasized economic systems . instead , it was the contrast between totalitarianism and respect for rights that completely discredited the oppressive regimes linked to moscow and helped to bring them down .
south africa ’s largely peaceful transition to a multi-racial democracy in the early 1990 ’s was a further advance for rights .
but the last decade of the twentieth century was also indelibly stained by ethnic cleansing in ex-yugoslavia and genocide in rwanda , and during the current decade the tide has seemed to turn against the rights cause .
powerful states such as china and russia are not limiting themselves to authoritarian rule at home , but are also supporting those in other countries engaged in similar practices .
the same is true of lesser powers such as iran and venezuela .
supply chains now can have as many significant international links as domestic ones , and a substantial share of internal demand is being met by products partly or wholly produced abroad .
as technological innovation further reduces entry barriers for both producers and consumers , the proliferation of these linkages becomes even easier , amplifying what already is essentially a spaghetti bowl of cross-border relationships and dependencies .
for the longer-term health of both individual participants and the overall system , these relationships must function effectively , based on a cooperative approach that is deemed credible .
if not , they risk resulting in a lower level of growth and welfare .
this is why the current confrontation between the us and china has raised fears of serious damage , particularly if it leads to ever-greater protectionism and a wider “ trade war . ”
if britain wants to do business with others , it will have to agree to common rules .
once it is out in the cold , it will have to decide with which economic bloc to align , and then accept that bloc ’s rules .
this is not about sovereignty or satrapy .
it is simply a question of whether we would prefer china ’s approach to intellectual property and technology transfers over those of the west , or european food and agricultural standards over those of the us .
if britain insists on pursuing a purist definition of sovereignty , it will find only grief and isolation .
in the us , which has the most progressive income tax among the major economies , federal tax reforms that would lower the rates and broaden the base are being discussed .
in europe , structural reforms focus on higher retirement ages and labor-market flexibility .
the deleveraging of governments , financial institutions , and households is one major cause of the sluggish economic recovery .
but sluggish growth means less tax revenue and more demands for payments to cushion hardship , placing pressure on government budgets .
the gamble has been that a solid , durable recovery would enable banks and households to rebuild their balance sheets quickly enough to avoid the need for additional bailouts .
bucerius later challenged thadden more directly , asking if he would have supported the attempted coup against adolf hitler in 1944 .
bauer then interjected that thadden ’s sister had been a member of the resistance .
thadden himself , however , avoided providing a direct answer , suggesting that he would not have fought alongside his sister .
nonetheless , dahrendorf was adamant that the npd ’s fate should be decided by the voters , rather than the courts , which had declared the communist party illegal .
kaul reiterated this idea in a passionate statement ( which had undoubtedly been agreed in advance by east german leaders ) about the exclusion of west germany ’s communists from the debate .
liquidity remains limited in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , the legacy of which includes a regulatory regime that is not conducive to long-term investment .
though financing for public infrastructure has returned to 2008 levels , little of it is being funneled into new projects .
most funds have targeted existing infrastructure – investments that are considered relatively safe , because they entail little or no construction risk and have demonstrated their potential to generate stable cash revenues .
in order to overcome the obstacles to investment , we propose the creation of an asset class that we call “ buy-and-hold equity " ( bhe ) .
this asset class would sit between traditional equity and debt , with investors able to hold it for 15 years or longer .
washington , dc – belarusian president alexander lukashenko is a master of political survival .
but , following a recent 64 % devaluation of the currency , the clock appears to be running out on his prolonged misrule .
lukashenko was forced by the removal of russian oil-price subsidies in 2009 to beg , borrow , or steal enough funds to keep belarus ’s economy from collapsing .
he tricked the international monetary fund into extending a $ 3.4 billion loan , promising freer elections in december 2010 – only to burn that bridge with a brutal crackdown when faced with an adverse election result and the largest protests his regime had ever seen .
now russia has taken a harder line , demanding a high price for loans that are , in any case , insufficient to save the regime .
in its current fight with google , for example , china ’s government appears to think that its technologists can provide the means to maintain the old thought control .
but , thankfully , for anyone with persistence and a modicum of computer skill , the internet leaks like a sieve .
the great progress of china ’s economy over the past 30 years is something all chinese celebrate .
but the jailing of liu also demonstrates in the starkest terms that china ’s neglect of human rights is flowing to the rest of world alongside the mass of chinese goods .
indeed , it is becoming increasingly clear that china opened its economy only to maintain the country ’s over-mighty rulers in power , not to respect and enhance the lives of ordinary chinese .
given these mounting concerns , implementation risks are now being presented in a different light .
at the world economic forum in davos in january , liu he , china ’s new vice premier for economic policy , hinted that upcoming reforms would be carried out with surprising speed .
in a recent signed commentary published in people ’s daily , he also noted that , “ strengthening the party ’s overall leadership is the core issue . ”
these views do not come out of thin air .
liu , a master tactician , seems to be underscoring the link between leadership power and the pace of reforms .
a similar picture , though on a smaller scale , exists in many european union member countries that are home to roma minorities .
a wide socioeconomic disparity exists between europe 's majority population and roma , or " gypsies " , many of whom live in extreme poverty .
left unchanged , this persistent poverty threatens to become a permanent drag on european prosperity , which would be a tragedy for roma and non-roma alike .
the situation of the 7-9 million roma living on the continent deserves the urgent attention of government leaders as they shape the policies of an enlarged eu .
roma are the continent 's fastest growing and most vulnerable minority .
it does not have to be this way .
to help find a solution , we have conducted a pest ( political , economic , sociocultural , and technological ) analysis of hong kong ’s current situation and future prospects .
on the political front , the main lesson is that it is up to the government to ensure order and security .
within the “ one country , two systems ” framework , hong kong ’s own government has powers to address internal security matters .
but where its actions are inadequate , it is the right and responsibility of china ’s central government to intervene .
in particular , it needs a program of ideas on research and development , education , and social inclusion that could appeal to large parts of the population in all member countries .
the european parliament elections are less than four months away .
pro-european forces need to campaign for a coordinated effort to counter the cyclical slowdown and – most importantly – for a cohesive and aggressive policy to address europe ’s long-term structural problems .
should they fail , the prospect of a parliament dominated by populist forces will become a reality .
and this could mark the beginning of a slow process of european disintegration .
when asked whether america was prepared to become the world ’s second-largest economy , they were reticent .
their reaction was understandable : even entertaining the possibility of the us becoming “ number two ” amounts to career suicide for an american politician .
elected officials everywhere must adjust , to varying degrees , to fulfill the expectations of those who put them in office .
intellectuals , on the other hand , have a special obligation to think the unthinkable and speak the unspeakable .
they are supposed to consider all possibilities , even disagreeable ones , and prepare the population for prospective developments .
mexico city – the current era of innovation , in which cutting-edge technologies are disrupting entire economic sectors at a breathtaking rate , has been called the fourth industrial revolution .
it is also the theme of the world economic forum ’s annual meeting this week in davos , switzerland – and rightly so .
in the coming years , the scope and pace of innovation will transform how we produce , distribute , and consume .
to maximize the benefits , we must take steps now to prepare our economies and societies , with a focus on three key areas : education , the business environment , and connectivity .
human capital is vital to an economy ’s success , and mexico is no exception .
for example , payroll-tax cuts – which would enable small business-owners and entrepreneurs to expand , innovate , and become more competitive , thereby bolstering job creation and economic growth – might require reducing rents .
in fact , italy ’s tax system is skewed in favor of savers .
a 12.5 % tax is levied on capital gains from government bonds , while entrepreneurs risking their own capital to launch new businesses must pay roughly 50 % of their start-up costs in taxes .
similarly , italy ’s real-estate tax amounts to about 2 % of total government revenue , compared to the oecd average of 4 % – and the government intends to slash it further .
and landlords pay a 15 % tax on rents , while unskilled workers pay a 23 % tax on their meager incomes .
and though thousands – perhaps tens of thousands – of protesters have gathered in front of the supreme court in recent weeks , some eight million people voted for the pis in the 2015 election .
current polls show that the pis ’s popularity has risen to around 40 % – more than twice that of the previous ruling party , civic platform .
this suggests that while poles may not agree with the pis ’s judicial reforms , they are not keen to risk much for free courts – or for liberal-democratic principles generally .
accordingly , pis chairman jarosław kaczyński can now declare that , “ the european commission will not break poland ’s will regarding the completion of reforms … if we do not reform the judiciary , other reforms will have little sense , because sooner or later they would be negated , withdrawn by the courts that we have now . ”
kaczyński knows full well that his party commands the most public support , and that the ecj will most likely not be able to act in time .
tim thought that … hank took a different view , ” and so on , as if the three musketeers had been interviewed by an oral historian .
there is also some routine praise for the two presidents they worked with , george w. bush and barack obama , and a reprise of their frustration with people who did not see the world their way , and obstructed their solutions , like sheila bair of the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) and various pesky members of congress .
the main interest lies not so much in the narrative chapters , which cover the same ground as their earlier books , as in their policy recommendations for the future .
it is noteworthy that they have been able to reach consensus on quite a radical program .
three proposals in particular should cause policymakers in the united states and elsewhere to think hard .
sentiment toward trump is even more unfavorable in western europe .
in germany , only 6 % of respondents think he is qualified to hold his current office , and 91 % regard him as arrogant .
similarly , 89 % of respondents in the united kingdom think trump is arrogant , and only 50 % still believe that the us and the uk have a special relationship now that he is in office .
this may help to explain why trump ’s scheduled state visit to the uk has been postponed indefinitely .
the countries where trump has the most widespread support are poland ( 73 % see the us favorably ) and hungary ( 63 % ) , which are both led by populist right-wing governments .
in the sixteenth century , control of colonies and gold bullion gave spain the edge ; seventeenth-century holland profited from trade and finance ; eighteenth-century france gained from its larger population and armies ; and nineteenth-century british power rested on its industrial primacy and its navy .
conventional wisdom has always held that the state with the largest military prevails , but in an information age it may be the state ( or non-state ) with the best story that wins .
today , it is far from clear how the balance of power is measured , much less how to develop successful survival strategies .
in his inaugural address in 2009 , president barack obama stated that “ our power grows through its prudent use ; our security emanates from the justness of our cause , the force of our example , the tempering qualities of humility and restraint . ”
shortly thereafter , secretary of state hillary clinton said , “ america can not solve the most pressing problems on our own , and the world can not solve them without america .
more recently , german finance minister wolfgang schäuble sparked controversy when , evidently drawing inspiration from that experience , he said that “ france would be glad if someone could force the parliament ” to reform .
the truth , of course , is that authoritarian systems – whatever their short-term successes in holding the line against irresponsible policies – are unsustainable in the long run .
a lack of accountability inevitably produces corruption and inefficiency – problems with which china is now wrestling .
the challenge for democracies is to develop mechanisms that allow them to set policies that are sustainable in the long term while safeguarding the democratic process itself .
the public consensus supporting difficult reforms in eastern europe in the 1990s demonstrates that voters are able to understand and accept tradeoffs when they have no perceived alternative .
he had to stay in nebraska and help my grandfather save the family farm from the banks , which had already repossessed one-third of the land .
the most important change my father made was in his mindset : he came to think of the farm not as a subsistence operation , but as a family business .
he turned to the university of nebraska , where he had received his undergraduate degree , and acquired hybrid corn and other improved seeds that the university was developing .
then he tracked inputs and weather conditions , which was rarely done at that time .
my father realized that he could n’t go it alone , and that he would need better access to financing .
it also means applying strict co2 emission limits to new passenger cars , public transport , and commercial sea and air transport .
and it means making europe , together with our car industry , the first electric-vehicle continent by 2030 .
second , europe must take the lead in the responsible use of resources and become a truly circular economy that minimizes waste .
today , eight billion tons of materials are processed into energy or products annually in the eu .
only 0.6 billion tons – a mere 7.5 % – originate from recycling .
recognizing this trend , the world economic forum global agenda council has brought together a group of experts and practitioners to help infuse substance into the foreign-policy discussions leading up to the us election , including by preparing a public discussion paper .
from my perspective as the group 's only european member , the overarching message should be that the us must conceive of itself not as “ the indispensable power , " as it now does , but as “ the indispensable partner . "
this is not merely a matter of semantics ; such a change will require the us to re-conceive its role in the world .
but the payoff , for both the us and the liberal world order that it created , would be substantial .
the key to success will be america 's ability to retain the best – and abandon the worst – of that most american of notions : exceptionalism .
outsiders misinterpreted this system – “ built on a clearly defined scheme , ” as xiang describes it , with “ blood-line royal legitimacy at the top ” and “ the scholar gentry to administer affairs of state ” – as a recipe for stagnation .
xiang argues that china ’s recent economic rise is simply a “ restoration ” of the success the country enjoyed before nineteenth-century western intrusions disrupted its harmonious system .
but the late angus maddison ’s estimates of historical gdp per capita suggest that china ’s economic “ retardation ” started well before its encounter with the west .
between 1500 and 1870 , per capita income barely moved from $ 600 , while the uk ’s quadrupled ( from $ 714 to $ 3,190 ) , and even spain ’s doubled .
china ’s political stability and relative absence of violence were thus achieved at the expense of economic dynamism , not in harmony with it .
this principle of regional solidarity extends to morocco ’s deployment of military hospitals not only in mali but also in other conflict zones , such as one in jordan that serves syrian refugees .
morocco is well positioned to promote security and development across northwest africa and beyond .
its political stability , open economy , and balanced international relations are increasingly aligned with the regional interests of the us and europe .
moreover , morocco is a loyal and longstanding us ally .
the west would do well to start cultivating a natural partner in such a dangerous and complex region .
the issue of women faculty members , especially in basic sciences , is far more complex .
i suspect that here the problem reflects fundamental differences between the way women and men approach science as a microcosm of life .
most of my fellow male faculty members are not muscle-bound , testosterone-driven types , but in their scientific careers , they display two types of typically male behavior .
the first is a compulsion to be the first to establish completely trivial facts about science .
as i grow older , i 'm no longer sure why this is so important , but the male members of our species seem to think that it is .
this , together with the prominence of the advisory board ( which includes well-known egyptian sociologist saad eddin ibrahim , french expert on political islam gilles kepel , and flynt leverett , a brookings institution fellow ) and the sensitivity of minority rights in general , combined to give the project national , regional , and international notice .
so far , syria 's authorities have not reacted to the tharwa project .
it 's probably still too early in the game for that .
but the project seems to represent the type of activity that can help produce visions for change .
some in the syrian government could be aware of this .
that growth reflects the flawed economic model of the pre-crisis years , which relied on indifference to where growth came from , how sustainable it was , and who was benefiting from it .
if we are to learn anything from the ongoing crisis , it must be to start asking the right questions .
every new bilateral agreement , every chapter of globalization , should be measured against new criteria .
how sustainable and how evenly spread will the macroeconomic benefits be ?
will they facilitate genuine development and provide dignified opportunities to those who become economically displaced ?
cambridge – in the euphoric moment immediately following the collapse of the soviet union , few would have guessed that ukraine – an industrialized country with an educated workforce and vast natural resources – would suffer stagnation for the next 28 years .
neighboring poland , which was poorer than ukraine in 1991 , managed almost to triple its per capita gdp ( in purchasing power parity ) over the next three decades .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
now consider other major emerging markets .
here currency appreciation is already taking place , pushed by massive capital inflows since the second quarter of 2009 , and in some cases it can already be said to be excessive ( for example , in brazil ) .
these countries can , of course , resist upward pressure on their currencies by accumulating foreign-exchange reserves , like they did before the global financial crisis .
the result is , of course , paradoxical : private funds that flow into these countries are recycled into us treasury securities via investment of accumulated reserves .
why should emerging-market countries ’ central banks undertake this peculiar financial intermediation , which represents a major cost , as the yield of private funds is higher than that of reserves ?
the asset-backed commercial paper market came to a standstill and the special investment vehicles set up by banks to get mortgages off their balance sheets could no longer get outside financing .
the final blow came when interbank lending , which is at the heart of the financial system , was disrupted because banks had to husband their resources and could not trust their counterparties .
central banks had to inject an unprecedented amount of money and extend credit on an unprecedented range of securities to a broader range of institutions than ever before .
that made the crisis more severe than any since world war ii .
credit expansion must now be followed by a period of contraction , because some of the new credit instruments and practices are unsound and unsustainable .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
trump ’s biggest problem is that the other signatories to the 2015 nuclear agreement – officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) – from which he has withdrawn the united states , have remained committed to the deal .
britain , france , germany , russia , and china have also opposed trump ’s imposition of crippling economic sanctions on iran .
they are committed to preserving the agreement and to doing everything possible to persuade iran ’s leaders to continue to adhere to it .
the european signatories have established a special mechanism to facilitate trade and business with iran at the risk of us retaliation , while russia and china have expanded their economic and strategic ties with the islamic republic , marking the first time in the history of the western alliance that america ’s european allies have joined forces with its rivals .
to compare , the average american pays 15 cents .
in other words , some of the world ’s poorest people are paying some of the highest prices for energy .
an effective solution to this problem exists : solar-power technology .
according to african progress panel estimates , poor african households would save $ 58 a year , on average , by installing solar panels – money that they could spend on education , health , and productive investment .
the firms providing those panels would , of course , also benefit considerably from tapping this large new market .
this process has been unfolding for centuries , but has accelerated in recent decades , as a select few have acquired an ever-larger share of total wealth and political influence .
today , just 100 corporations produce 71 % of greenhouse-gas ( ghg ) emissions .
the wealthiest 10 % of people are responsible for around 50 % of ghg emissions , while the poorest 50 % produce 10 % of emissions .
unwilling to stand up to those who are destroying our planet , political leaders have latched onto technological solutions , including geoengineering approaches that promise to suck already-emitted carbon out of the atmosphere .
even the ipcc included assumptions about such technologies in many of its modeled pathways for keeping global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 ° c above pre-industrial levels .
imports are 15 % of us gdp .
multiply 0.15 by 0.10 ( the hypothesized tariff rate ) , and you get 1.5 % .
allow for some substitution away from more expensive imported goods , and the number drops below 1 % .
and if growth slows because of the higher cost of imported intermediate inputs , the fed can offset this by raising interest rates more slowly .
foreign central banks can do likewise .
the ability to revoke citizenship without presenting any evidence in public is one reason why a government may prefer this course to arresting and trying terrorism suspects .
and yet simply revoking citizenship does not solve the problem of leaving at large a suspected terrorist , who may then carry out an attack elsewhere – unless , as with sakr , he is killed .
the larger question raised by the uk ’s proposed legislation is the desirable balance between individual rights , including the right to citizenship , and the public good .
suppose that the government gets it right 19 times out of 20 when it relies on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities to revoke people ’s citizenship .
if that were the case with the decisions made by the uk government in 2013 , there would still be a high probability that an innocent naturalized citizen was made stateless .
as old fossil-fuel plants age and are shut down , they should be replaced by clean power generation on a competitive basis , for example through renewable-energy auctions .
china and india , in particular , should stop building new coal-fired power plants at home , and capital-exporting countries like china and japan should stop financing new coal-fired plants in the rest of asia , such as pakistan and the philippines .
private-sector firms will compete intensively to lower still further the costs of renewable energy systems , including power generation , energy storage , and downstream uses such as electric vehicles , electric heating and cooking , and the new hydrogen economy .
governments should set limits on emissions , and the private sector should compete to deliver low-cost solutions .
government and business together should finance new research and development to drive costs even lower .
what the mikta countries share are rapid economic growth and increasing influence outside of their own borders .
they have development problems , but they are also models of economic dynamism and innovation with a substantial stake in the way post-wwii global institutions and rules should be reshaped .
many of their challenges and ambitions dovetail with those of the bics ( the brics , minus russia ) .
in the alphabet soup of international politics , a nine-member jawbreaker like bicsmikta might eventually prove too unwieldy to be workable .
the bottom line , though , is that russia ’s coming absence from the multilateral scene will be a catalyst for new thinking on global challenges .
it was too small to close the output gap , leaving continued downward pressure on demand .
much of the “ stimulus ” merely financed increased spending by state governments that would have been paid for in other ways .
other parts of the stimulus went to individuals , but , given the nature of the fiscal package , increased transfers and spending added more to the national debt than to gdp .
when the fed saw how weak the upturn remained , it launched a strategy of “ unconventional monetary policy , ” combining large-scale purchases of long-term securities ( quantitative easing ) with promises to keep the short-term federal funds rate extremely low for an extended period of time .
the goal was to encourage portfolio investors to shift into equities and other assets , with the resulting increase in their prices pushing up household wealth and consumer spending .
in denmark , my own country , economic readiness is not the issue .
indeed , danish voters have seen most of the benefits of euro membership already , due to the danish krone ’s unchanged link first to the dm , then to the euro , over the past 15 years .
public rejection of the euro in the september 2000 referendum hinged on a failure by the euro ’s supporters to explain the difference between this uncontested policy and full euro participation .
as a result , denmark may be the last to vote , but not necessarily to join .
despite the different starting positions , sweden , denmark , and the uk have this in common : they prefer to see the euro as a cap stone in constructing the single market rather than as a stepping stone to closer union .
to be sure , north korea ’s regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement .
conservatives in both the united states and south korea may argue that north korea must first move toward denuclearization before any kind of economic assistance is offered .
but there is no reason why international efforts to ensure north korea ’s denuclearization must preclude policies aimed at bringing about domestic reform .
we need not assume that these goals can not be pursued simultaneously .
on the contrary , it may be impossible to win north korea ’s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change .
and no one should doubt that the front and its voters mean what they say .
at the heart of europe ’s political crisis is the eurozone ’s economic and financial malaise , which neither national governments nor eu institutions seem able to address .
rather than strengthening pan-european solidarity , economic distress has led to a massive distribution conflict .
what once was a relationship among equals has given way to a face-off between debtors and creditors .
the mutual distrust that characterizes this conflict may irreparably harm the soul of the union and the entire european project .
the larger the market , the larger the cost advantage .
moreover , information goods produced at larger scale are also more valuable to consumers .
the version with the largest market share becomes the standard ; it is the easiest to figure out how to use , the easiest to find support for , and the one that works best with other products ( which are , of course , designed to work best with it ) .
in the section of the " new economy " dominated by producers ' economies of scale and consumers ' economies of scope , a firm that establishes a lead in market share gains a nearly overwhelming advantage .
unless its competitors take extraordinary and extraordinarily costly steps -- like those taken by microsoft against netscape , its rival in the internet browser market , by pouring a fortune into creating its internet explorer and then distributing it for free -- the first firm to establish a dominant market position will reap high profits as long as its sector of the industry lasts .
that is why its member states must take the lead in proposing solutions .
the most urgent priority is to create safe and legal paths for refugees to reach europe .
this does not imply that every vulnerable migrant must be accepted .
but the eu should be more systematically generous in determining how many to admit , and it should implement organized ways to facilitate their entry .
such a system would protect migrants and safeguard europe ( by enabling it to vet applicants fully ) .
citizens ’ behavior does not seem to have changed as dramatically as have their responses to poll questions .
three-quarters of americans feel connected to their communities , and say the quality of life there is excellent or good ; 40 % say working with others in their community is the most important thing that they can do .
in recent years , american politics and political institutions have become more polarized than the distribution of opinions in the american public would suggest .
the situation was exacerbated by the economic downturn after 2008 .
as an editorial in the economist recently concluded , “ america ’s political system was designed to make legislation at the federal level difficult , not easy .
new york – history at any moment can be understood as a snapshot , telling us where we are , or as a moving picture , telling us not just where we are but where we have been and where we may be headed .
it is a distinction with an enormous difference .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
innovation can also drive pollution abatement .
for example , shenzhen ’s urban air mobility ( uam ) project , which provides on-demand helicopter transport , leverages the city ’s well-known innovative capacities while addressing congestion .
initiatives that advance pollution abatement goals while providing fair access to services among residents should be subsidized by central government .
awareness is the third pillar of a strategy to tackle air pollution .
this does not necessarily mean inundating people with news stories about global environmental devastation ; on the contrary , that approach can lead to desensitization .
perhaps , but so far conventional solutions have proved unworkable , even disastrous .
after some years of such a saudi protectorate over the palestinians , serious negotiations - more or less based on crown prince abdullah 's proposals for an overall agreement - could be re-launched .
in the meantime , the most urgent priority is a process of de-escalation , stabilization and political consolidation within palestinian society .
a saudi protectorate may be the key to achieving this .
everything else having already failed , it may be the only choice left for both israelis and palestinians .
first , the european financial stability facility must serve to rescue the banking system as well as member states .
this would allow sovereign debt to be restructured without precipitating a banking crisis .
despite this added task , the size of the rescue package could remain the same , because any amount used for recapitalizing or liquidating banks would reduce the amount needed by governments .
bringing the banking system under european supervision , rather than leaving it in the hands of national authorities , would be a fundamental improvement that would help restore confidence .
and it would have the additional merit of enlightening the german public about the true purpose of the rescue operation .
on the contrary , at the outset , he may be able to galvanize many alienated young voters against a government that has earned wary respect but is not much liked .
second , without effective and responsible opposition , governments can become arrogant , careless , and too focused on their own supporters .
in this case , leaders of the conservative party ’s far-right component are likely to think that they can dispense with offering disciplined support to prime minister david cameron and his policies , because labour can never win under corbyn , anyway .
third , at some time over the next year , the uk will face a referendum over its membership in the european union .
while no one knows the position corbyn will take on this issue , one can speculate that he , like some of the trade-union bosses who support him , might decide that the eu is a rich man ’s club , thereby precluding the much-needed cross-party consensus in favor of continued membership .
the bailout was brought about by aig ’s large losses on derivative transactions with financial institutions , mostly sophisticated players such as goldman sachs and spain ’s banco santander .
after the government ’s infusion of funds in september 2008 , aig ’s losses continued to mount , so the government provided substantial amounts of additional capital two months later .
at this point , the government asked aig ’s derivative counterparties to take a voluntary “ haircut ” – that is , accept a discount on the amount owed to them .
when some of these parties refused , the government backed down and financed aig ’s payment of all of its derivative obligations in full .
the us government felt that it had a weak hand , because it was not prepared to allow aig to default on any of its obligations .
israel has long since decided that it has no interest in renewing its control over the gaza strip .
in some ways , hamas ’s coup makes things clearer .
gaza is ruled by a completely hostile regime .
israel will feel free to retaliate for cross-border attacks and continuing rocket fire at civilian targets within the country .
at last , the world must recognize that the hopes stirred by the 1990 ’s peace process have been completely dashed .
technological innovation and demographics are now a headwind , not a tailwind , for growth , and financial engineering ca n’t save the day .
the aberrant period in history is the hundred or so years after the us civil war , during which breakthroughs in energy , electrification , telecommunications , and transportation fundamentally reshaped societies .
human lives became markedly more productive , and life expectancies rose dramatically .
the global population grew over 50 % between 1800 and 1900 , and then more than doubled over the following 50 years , with economies growing much faster than in previous centuries .
by the end of the 1970s , growth began to slow in many of the developed western economies , and us president ronald reagan and federal reserve chair alan greenspan ushered in a debt cycle that supercharged activity .
the core of japan ’s political inertia consists in the current pseudo-two-party system comprising the ldp and the dpj , because the parties ’ divisions are actually devoid of any consistent ideological and policy differences .
both parties include conservatives and liberals , defense hawks and doves .
the dpj ’s president , ichiro ozawa , who once served as an ldp secretary general , is an exemplar of this confused legacy .
sadly , the chances that the ldp will reform , or that the dpj will evolve into a responsible party of government in the foreseeable future , are slim .
japan seems condemned to endure chronic and pointless political trench warfare until some crisis forces a realignment of political parties along ideological and policy lines .
and because his suspension of parliament has outraged rebel conservatives who had previously balked at bringing down their own government , a no-confidence vote now stands a greater chance of success .
but bringing down the government would not be sufficient to stop a no-deal brexit .
the motley crew of rebels also would need to support the formation of a caretaker government that would seek a brexit extension , call a general election , and perhaps also legislate for a second referendum .
moreover , labour party leader jeremy corbyn , a hardline socialist and closet brexiteer , insists on leading such a government .
that would require conservative rebels , opposition liberal democrats , and also mps who quit labour in protest over corbyn ’s leadership to rally behind him – a tall order .
this arrangement also required the usually vigilant us internal revenue service to play along .
asi ’s profits stem from apple ’s intellectual property ( ip ) rights , which are based on research and development conducted exclusively in the us ( most of it underpinned by federal government funding ) .
these profits should , therefore , be taxed in the us .
curiously , the irs is choosing not to enforce apple ’s obligation to pay tax on its profits from us-sourced ip returns .
instead , apple charges asi a symbolic fee for allowing it to profit from apple ’s ip rights , for which it pays a tiny tax to the irs .
each one of them has gained ( or maintained ) power by polarizing their societies and mobilizing their electoral base .
the pekos ’ political style has been enabled by modern news media , which , scrambling for audience share , simplify and sensationalize issues .
starkly antagonistic statements and positions tend to gain the most exposure .
this gives confrontational politicians a powerful advantage , and produces the electoral polarization on which the pekos have fed .
this political strategy is undoubtedly effective .
this suggestion may be amusing coming from a child , but there 's nothing funny when governments apply it , as they increasingly do , to complex policies that involve science and technology .
britons had their say during the summer , for example , on whether they want gene-spliced , or genetically modified ( gm ) , products in their fields and food .
to gauge public opinion in advance of a decision scheduled for later this year on whether to allow commercial planting of gm crops , the british government sponsored ( at great expense ) a series of public discussions around the country .
local governments and other organizations held hundreds of additional public meetings .
the head of the british debates ' organizing committee , professor malcolm grant , called them a " unique experiment to find out what ordinary people really think once they 've heard all the arguments . "
in fact , the kremlin is financing many of these parties .
lenin once said that capitalists would sell the ropes with which they would be hanged .
today , european governments appear willing to allow putin to buy the votes with which he will destroy the eu .
there are other kremlin supporters as well , including corporate leaders who want to return to business as usual with russia , and academic apologists for the soviet union who , 25 years after its collapse , see a chance for vindication .
and , with public opinion polls revealing that a significant minority of europeans are falling in line with putin 's rhetoric , his strategy of dividing the eu and nato seems to be making real headway .
in germany alone , construction projects claim an average of more than 75 hectares per day .
inappropriate agricultural practices are also to blame : the liberal use of synthetic fertilizer , for example , decimates organisms inhabiting the soil and changes its structure .
it takes millennia for fertile topsoil to form ; in many places , a cloudburst is now all it takes to wash it away .
at the same time , global demand for food , fodder , and biomass for fuels is growing , in turn driving up the value of land – a fact that has not escaped international investors ’ attention .
according to a world bank estimate , 10-30 % of arable land worldwide – land that would be used by millions of smallholders , pastoralists , and indigenous people – has been affected by large-scale investment .
convinced that history will judge the president by his success in containing the iranian threat , broder also assumes that a war with iran would reignite the american economy .
that is a strange idea , given that today ’s two ongoing wars have only compounded the us economy ’s weaknesses .
an american war against iran is plausible only as a response to a blatant and immediate iranian challenge to vital us interests , such as a major terrorist attack , an invasion of an ally in the gulf , or disruption of the free flow of middle east oil to the west .
the iranian regime is far too astute to cross any of these red lines .
iran , like north korea , will continue to test obama ’s capacity to build international alliances aimed at putting pressure on defiant states .
the imf 's economic framework still does not provide for countercyclical fiscal policies , because the imf remains ambivalent about the standard keynesian prescription of stimulating an economy in a downturn .
in brazil and elsewhere , the imf 's distorted accounting frameworks ­ - what it does and does not count as expenditures - continues to impede the investments required to modernize public-sector enterprises and to put a major roadblock in the way of land reform .
for example , when the government borrows to buy land , it is treated as debt , but the offsetting transaction when it sells the land through a mortgage effectively goes unrecognized .
while the president of germany is not supposed to intervene in the day-to-day management of the country , his voice will no doubt be influential .
it is here that germany should take pause and look at the record .
washington , dc – donald trump has officially been inaugurated as us president , but questions about russia ’s interference in the election will not go away .
yet one key question is often lost in the fray : why did russian president vladimir putin do it ?
of course , it is not difficult to guess why putin preferred trump to his opponent , former secretary of state hillary clinton .
but there is a difference between hoping for an outcome and going to great lengths – and incurring great risks – to help bring it about .
in our view , the us intelligence agencies ’ conclusion that , by helping trump , the kremlin was advancing its “ longstanding desire to undermine the us-led liberal democratic order ” is not entirely convincing .
moreover , the country is projected to grow at an 8-8.5 % rate in the next fiscal year .
no budget changes could generate such a marked , cost-free acceleration in growth .
it is fair to say that the usually staid statistics department stole the thunder from this year 's budget .
nonetheless , finance minister arun jaitley 's budget succeeds on several fronts – not least in its alignment of vision and implementation .
specifically , it advances the government 's vision of a pro-growth agenda that enhances the ease of doing business in india , while targeting better delivery mechanisms for welfare schemes .
but it also followed a conciliatory diplomatic policy toward britain and the us , and spent considerable resources to make itself attractive overseas .
after the failure of its imperialist greater east asia co-prosperity scheme of the 1930 ’s ( which had a soft-power component of anti-european propaganda ) and its defeat in world war ii , japan turned to a strategy that minimized military power and relied on strategic alliance with the us .
japan ’s single-minded focus on economic growth achieved its goal , but the country developed only modest military and soft power .
in its first decades , communist china built its military strength and simultaneously used the soft power of maoist revolutionary doctrine and third world solidarity to cultivate allies abroad .
but , after the exhaustion of the maoist strategy in the 1970 ’s , chinese leaders turned to market mechanisms to foster economic development .
xi ’s anti-corruption campaign has gone as far as taking down a retired member of the politburo standing committee , china ’s most powerful body .
likewise , carbon-dioxide emissions have fallen dramatically since the beginning of this year , and the authorities appear to be well on the way to hitting the carbon-intensity target established in 2010 .
regulatory reforms are beginning to mitigate shadow-banking risks , and even some ghost towns are being revived by market forces .
at the upcoming fifth plenum , china ’s leaders must build on this progress , agreeing to keep up the reform momentum .
to succeed , the government must , as xi put it , “ gnaw even tough bones ” – that is , overcome vested interests that are resisting change .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
in keeping with the spirit of the times , governments introduce business criteria for measuring the efficiency -- and the " success , " more generally -- of public services .
this means , above all , that they set performance targets .
so ministers proclaim that street crime will be halved by next spring , or that the proportion of each generation going to universities will be raised to 50 % in five years .
waiting lists for hospital beds will be cut by one-third within two years .
this method of governance makes it appear that , at long last , we can hold politicians accountable by establishing whether targets have been reached or not .
peru 's president alejandro toledo has invented a new extreme sport , a soccer game in which he is the sole player .
instead of kicking the ball to win , he aims so that his opponent scores .
this explains why , with more than half of his term left , the man who led a popular movement to unseat former president alberto fujimori holds a mere 7 % popularity rating today - the lowest ranking of any peruvian leader since 1980 , when democracy was re-established .
toledo assumed the presidency planning to dismantle the corruption that marked fujimori 's administrations and end the reign of his crooked chief of intelligence , vladimiro montesinos .
toledo claimed that he would send all dishonest officials to prison - words that captured the imagination of peruvians , who yearned to see criminal politicians brought to justice .
a mistake in a presidential debate can turn the tide of public opinion overnight , as happened to president gerald ford in his debate with jimmy carter in 1976 .
conversely , ronald reagan ’s performance in his debate with carter in 1980 is often credited with his victory .
another event that could turn the tables would be an “ october surprise ” associated with terrorism , which could switch the agenda from the financial crisis back to security , the republicans ’ stronger suit .
in 2004 , shortly before the election , osama bin laden released a video tape that may have helped president bush defeat senator john kerry .
from bin laden ’s point of view , bush ’s policies were more useful for his efforts to recruit supporters than kerry ’s might have been .
but i see a practical turn in all this that no one has yet broached .
would n’t lugovoi ’s entrance into politics bring about the ideal solution to the problem of finding an heir for putin ?
that search , after all , is threatening to divide the nation ’s elite .
so why not choose a man like lugovoi who truly represents what that elite stands for ?
let us compare two potential presidential candidates , putin in 1999 and lugovoi in 2007 .
their mythical tribe was great in some mythical past , so why not try to recreate it ?
such thinking poses a serious threat to the world ’s most vulnerable people .
the united nations sustainable development goal to eliminate extreme poverty worldwide by 2030 is entirely dependent on continued economic growth through trade , technological innovation , and international cooperation .
erecting trade barriers , engaging in digital mercantilism , and generally undermining the liberal world order will severely harm the extreme poor in africa and other underdeveloped regions , while doing nothing to help coal miners in west virginia .
the strong will always manage , but the weak will bear the burden of a nostalgic protectionism that erodes the benefits of globalization .
some argue that the state – and , by extension , the communist party of china ( cpc ) – must retain a prominent role , in order to uphold the social stability needed to sustain economic development .
others claim that spurring the innovation needed to reach high-income status requires the state to be less like a market participant and more like a referee , regulator , and arbiter of economic and social priorities .
without question , the state has been integral to china ’s development , not only by investing in areas like infrastructure and technology , but also by serving as a backstop as nascent markets and private-sector institutions developed .
state involvement is also needed to help manage inequality and ensure that growth patterns are inclusive , which markets alone can not be counted on to do .
moreover , the chinese state has resolved coordination problems that are not easily or efficiently handled by decentralized markets , particularly in developing countries , where market institutions and administrative capabilities may be at different stages of development .
but the economic urgency is not reflected in the policy response , which has been painfully slow or non-existent .
for example , egypt ’s fiscal deficit will exceed 11 % of gdp this year .
but the country ’s leaders have been stalling on the terms of a much-needed international monetary fund loan .
the government ’s reduction of fuel subsidies last year was not followed by additional reforms , and the required tax increase was delayed soon after president mohamed morsi announced it .
almost all political stakeholders in egypt , as in the other arab countries in transition , recognize the need for economic reform .
and yet that could very well happen .
our unicef survey of 126 developing countries found that among the nearly one-half that are reducing public expenditures , common adjustment measures include public-sector wage cuts or caps , withdrawal of food subsidies , and the targeting and rationalization of already meager social-protection systems .
these adjustment measures are often adopted without carefully examining their social impact .
how many poor children will suffer – or die – from lack of food and health care ?
how many children will miss out on education because teachers are absent due to low wages , or simply because poor children must work to supplement their family income ?
indeed , germany ’s future could play out in two ways .
the world has a large stake in which scenario prevails .
the first scenario is bleak : germany fails to integrate the refugees socially and economically , political discontent surges , and the newcomers become increasingly frustrated with their plight .
any steps they take to vent that frustration embolden right-wing populists and could lead to violence from both sides .
if , in the worst case , a terrorist attack were to occur – especially one that could , in some way , be linked to refugees – the nationalist-populist reaction would be powerful , potentially weakening the very fabric of german society .
by contrast , the army ’s decision to allow mubarak loyalists – some riding camels or horses – to charge into cairo ’s tahrir square and attack thousands of anti-government demonstrators was a classic “ military as government ” move .
at this point , a democratic transition will most likely require that the army play a more active role in protecting protesters .
what is clear is that the interest of the “ military as institution ” depends on the army ’s ability to establish much greater separation from the regime .
successful political transitions are also helped if more and more citizens come to feel that they “ own ” the protests and the resulting transition .
in this respect , the fact that the demand for mubarak ’s immediate resignation originated from cairo ’s tahrir square rather than from the obama administration is a positive development .
at the same time , obviously , they will be working in close cooperation with ugandan forces .
but does the uganda operation , following so closely on the libya intervention , herald a police role for the us whenever the un or the icc – which , lacking their own police force , rely on their members and interstate cooperation – judges it necessary ?
given america ’s reluctance to join the icc ( or to bring its own torturers to justice in us courts ) , such a role would be vulnerable to both international and domestic political attack .
nevertheless , the extent of us cooperation with the icc has exceeded even the constructive role that the obama administration had proposed .
evidently , american policymakers are increasingly receptive to the potential of international criminal justice to undergird the terms of a new form of global engagement .
so why do n't americans feel more alarm at their country 's rising income inequality ?
part of the reason that they do n't is that most americans do not recognize what is going on .
one poll found that 19 % of americans think their incomes put them in the top 1 % of income distribution - and that 20 % more hope to reach the top 1 % someday .
deep in the core of american ideology and culture is a constellation of beliefs and attitudes : belief that the future will be brighter than the present ; that what you accomplish you make with your own hands ; that individuals should rely on themselves , not the state ; that people can cross oceans and mountains to make for themselves a better life ; and that those who succeed do so not through luck and corruption but through preparation and industry .
these are not beliefs conducive to social democracy .
stockholm – our generation has a unique opportunity .
if we set our minds to it , we could be the first in human history to leave our children nothing : no greenhouse-gas emissions , no poverty , and no biodiversity loss .
that is the course that world leaders set when they met at the united nations in new york on september 25 to adopt the sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) .
the 17 goals range from ending poverty and improving health to protecting the planet ’s biosphere and providing energy for all .
they emerged from the largest summit in the un ’s history , the “ rio +20 ” conference in 2012 , followed by the largest consultation the un has ever undertaken .
so the noisiest are often rewarded with a megaphone , while less polarizing , less privileged voices are drowned out , even if they are providing the smart and nuanced perspectives that can truly enrich public discussions .
if the algorithm does n’t do the job of silencing less privileged voices , online trolls often step in , directing hateful and threatening speech at whomever they choose .
women and minorities are particularly likely to be victims of online harassment , but anyone may be targeted .
the german blogger richard gutjahr , for example , became the object of conspiracy theories and the target of intense harassment after being present at two terrorist attacks within two weeks of each other .
victims of online harassment often respond with self-censorship , and many , with their sense of security and even self-worth eroded , remove themselves from social media altogether .
africans barely count in american politics .
africans do n't vote ; they do n't buy us products ; they do n't threaten violence .
they are simply poor , hungry , and disease-ridden .
few rich countries do better than the us .
i single out america not because it is unique in its neglect , but because it is unique in its capacity to lead .
hence , as he put it in 1932 , there may be “ no escape from prolonged and perhaps interminable depression except by direct state intervention to promote and subsidize new investment ” – which is what the obama administration is rightly doing .
on the question of what caused the crash , the debate is more even .
krugman is hampered by the fact that he attributes the crash to “ irrationality , ” which , as cochrane points out , is no theory .
this is because krugman refuses to take seriously keynes ’s crucial distinction between risk and uncertainty .
in my view , keynes ’s major contribution to economic theory was to emphasize the “ extreme precariousness of the basis of knowledge on which our estimates of prospective yield have to be made . ”
cape town – nowadays , people are too often forced to choose between doing what is morally right and doing what is economically beneficial .
indeed , their options sometimes appear to be mutually exclusive , making the decision of which path to take exceedingly challenging .
sometimes , however , moral rectitude and economic interest merge , presenting an opportunity that must not be missed .
that is the case – from the perspectives of this archbishop and former finance minister – with the world ’s response to climate change .
the moral imperative is indisputable , as the effects of climate change – including extreme weather , temperature changes , and rising sea levels – are felt most keenly by the global poor , who have also benefited the least from the economic activities that cause it .
and on that day , he was so well mourned that his absence seemed like part of a show , somehow making us forget that he was no longer with us .
abiding in each of us was the johnny that moved us all : the youth spent with a traveling act , like gautier ’s captain fracasse ; the father , a character out of modiano , who , between bouts of drinking , pawned the gifts given to him by his abandoned son .
and then there was the ’60s rocker with the eyes of a sad wolf and cheekbones hewn by giacometti , the catcher in the rye mood , and a melancholy so intensely hopeless that it seemed to condemn him to live on the edge of every form of excess .
he was the consummate artist of the french scene , a chameleon beamed out on satellite tv , dripping with fake sweat and real glitz , an artist who , like a novelist , confessed as a way of lying .
hallyday was the child of a generation that watched american gis enter paris and that invented for itself an american ascendance .
of course , it was subject to ups and downs , but it was not subject to financial crises of the type that we see regularly today .
moreover , capitalism in the post-wwii decades maintained full employment , with unemployment often hovering around 2 % in europe , north america , and japan .
job insecurity back then was mostly unknown and mass poverty had disappeared .
the keys to that period of growth and happiness were a strong social welfare system and mainly keynesian domestic and foreign economic policies in all the world ’s big states .
above all , every developed economy pursued policies designed to provide high wages , which would guarantee high consumption and thus rapid growth .
we are interested and associated , but not absorbed . ”
that seems to reflect the stance – expressed by cameron and former chancellor of the exchequer george osborne – that helped to set the stage for brexit .
in response to the euro crisis , they argued that europe needed more fiscal integration , but without the uk ; there would be no british financial participation in future euro rescue operations .
solidarity ( at least the kind that costs money ) stopped at the english channel .
but , like de gaulle ’s declaration and may ’s slogan , churchill ’s statements employed the language of political ambiguity .
what the west can do is apply pressure on iran – and on other governments in the future – to assure and account for the safety of protesters .
natan sharansky said that this tactic – the west tracking and demanding accountability for the treatment of individual internal dissenters – helped break up the soviet union .
in this crisis , the us president should form a united front with human rights groups , which can advise him exactly how to follow , sustain , and support those iranians who have been or may yet be arrested , or worse .
barack obama says that america “ stands with ” those who support free assembly .
that will be welcome news to people living under dictatorial regimes installed and propped up by the us , and to the opposition leaders and journalists languishing in us-supported prisons in those countries for having engaged in just such protest .
russian membership in the world trade organization has the potential to strengthen the rule of law , combat corruption , and give russia a stake in better relations with the outside world .
closer ties between russia and the european union make sense for similar reasons .
there should also be some understanding for what russia and the russian people have gone through over the past two decades .
losing a country and a special place in the world is the sort of trauma that could lead to the emergence of extreme and potentially violent nationalism .
russia should be treated as a major power , which means consultations on important global issues .
but a consensus had emerged in brazil that a left party could neither win nor govern with hard-left ideas , and lula ’s presidency did not challenge this view .
the consensus may have reflected the success of lula ’s predecessor , fernando henrique cardoso , the relative success of privatization and liberal market economies around the world , and the growth of brazil ’s middle class .
whatever the case , for key leaders of the brazilian left , including rousseff , capitalism became part of the solution , not the fundamental problem .
investors take all kinds of risks .
the biggest are not always the legal ones on which the world bank and development agencies have focused ; rather , they are the business risks of a company that fails or a polity that implodes .
of course , my reduced cost will be someone else ’s reduced revenue – and not just apple ’s .
one big loser in this world will be the freight business ( along with junkyards , logistics companies , and centralized recycling operations ) .
when things can be made , used , broken/worn out , and recycled closer to home , the need for transport is reduced dramatically .
recycled materials do not need to be delivered to centralized processing centers and then forwarded to factories .
products will not need to be made in those factories and then shipped to customers or to inventory centers .
london – in the 1960 ’s , the green revolution – which included the development of high-yielding crop varieties , the expansion of irrigation infrastructure , and the distribution of modern fertilizers and pesticides to developing-country farmers – bolstered agricultural production worldwide .
but chronic hunger remains pervasive , particularly in developing countries , which are affected most by crop shortages and food-price volatility .
by 2050 , the global human population is expected to exceed nine billion .
achieving food security means ensuring that all people have consistent , affordable access to the right nutrients , despite land and water limitations , climate change , and the growing prevalence of resource-intensive western-style diets that accompany rising incomes .
surmounting these challenges will not be easy .
indeed , for many years , domestic critics of erdoğan ’s government have been denouncing what they describe as the “ putinization ” of the regime .
turkey , not the european union , is currently making its presence felt in the world .
but the course of history may change rapidly .
in reality , turkey needs europe as much as europe needs turkey .
europe is for turkey “ a principle of moderation ” and an enticement to remain democratic .
on the contrary , experience indicates that governments often struggle to align public spending with underlying or mounting problems , such as public-health threats , until they reach a crisis point .
more people died of cancer in the us last year than in combat .
in fact , last year ’s 580,000 cancer deaths exceed the roughly 430,000 battle deaths , on average , in world war i , world war ii , the korean war , the vietnam war , and the gulf war .
yet government spending on cancer averages approximately $ 4 billion per year .
that is just over 0.5 % of the annual military budget of roughly $ 718 billion .
a journalist visiting the kingdom of saudi arabia recently asked me why five out of six students he interviewed at king saud university still believe that al qaida was not responsible for the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon in america last year ?
dealing with this question is increasingly frustrating for me , because i have run out of plausible explanations .
i used to believe that denial of saudi complicity in the attacks reflected our distress with what happened on that dark day .
i hoped that we would have the courage to overcome our perceived humiliation and start looking deep into our national psyche , asking the big question , " why did 15 of our young men attack america in so brutal a way ? "
so far , we are no closer than we were after the attack to answering to this question , because we can not even find the nerve to ask it .
moreover , income inequality has widened , with the global phenomenon of increasing concentration of wealth at the top very pronounced in many arab countries .
top incomes in these countries have resulted largely from political patronage , rather than from innovation and hard work .
while tunisia was an extreme case of a regime furthering the economic interests of a small clique of insiders , the pattern was widespread .
that is why a knee-jerk , simplistic “ washington consensus ” prescription of more liberalization and privatization is inappropriate for the arab world in 2012 .
there is a clear political need for a growth strategy in which inclusion is the centerpiece , not an afterthought .
but that is no longer the case .
indeed , trump ’s recent actions are not just about trade , but about america ’s departure from pax americana itself .
few countries are more connected to the post-war order than germany , which , like japan , owes its economic resurgence after 1945 to the rules-based trading system .
germany ’s economy relies heavily on exports , which means that it is acutely vulnerable to trade barriers and punitive tariffs imposed by major trading partners .
trump ’s protectionist policies thus challenge the entire german economic model as it has existed since the 1950s .
during macron ’s first five-year term , therefore , he should focus on raising france ’s gdp growth to an average of at least 2 % a year , and reducing unemployment to below 6 % .
the easiest way to achieve both goals would be to focus on where france is underperforming relative to other eu countries .
part of the unemployment challenge is tied to hidden costs .
france has some of the highest labor costs for hourly employees in the eu , and a natural consequence is tepid hiring .
with inequality also growing , many french are rightly upset that labor is taxed much more than capital gains .
in early december , putin signed a federal budget for 2015 that foresaw 2 % annual gdp growth and a budget deficit amounting to 0.5 % of gdp .
but collapsing oil prices , together with tough economic sanctions imposed by the us and europe , meant that by the end of the month , the government was predicting a 4 % decline in gdp and a budget deficit of 3.5 % of gdp – and that after budget cuts worth 1 % of gdp .
based on these figures , it is estimated that , by the end of this year , russia will spend 70 % of the reserve fund accrued over the last decade or so , when oil prices were high .
if low oil prices persist , and western economic sanctions remain in place , russia will run out of cash by the end of 2016 .
nonetheless , putin ’s approval rating remains at around 80 % .
but , of course , libra is being sold as much more than this .
as one facebook executive puts it , “ we want sending money to be as easy as sending a text message . ”
given that libra will take the form of private money linked to a basket of stable major currencies , how would this work in practice ?
if the people of argentina could switch from pesos to a basket of stable currencies with a single touch of their smartphones , would n’t they then pour into that safe asset at the first hint of trouble in the domestic economy ?
a standard “ efficient market ” analysis does not help us answer that question , because in perfect markets , such flows would be self-correcting .
the recently rising euro also has helped keep down european long-term interest rates — a key determinant of economic activity — as inflationary expectations deteriorated somewhat in the euro-zone area .
during april , the rise in inflationary expectations and the euro ’s appreciation occurred more or less concurrently .
the yield on the 10-year german bond , which might have been expected to go higher because of the deterioration in inflationary expectations during this period , barely moved .
this is a big plus for sustaining economic recovery .
should bush , bernanke or the new treasury secretary henry paulson cause investors to lose faith in us financial assets at some point in time , the rising euro will help shield european interest rates from the consequences .
this political entity is a precise counterpart in the political world to a well-known physical phenomenon of splintering or fissuring .
when stressed , a big surface bifurcates in big chunks , but then the disintegration continues into smaller and smaller fragments .
of the six larger eu states , only france has a really well-defined centralized political system . poland ’s centralism comes close , but strong regional differences persist – a legacy of the three large and quite different imperial systems that encompassed today ’s poland in the nineteenth century .
italy and germany were nineteenth-century amalgamations of a colorful variety of small and medium-size political units .
the united kingdom looks older and more stable , but scotland today is controlled by a political party that wants to repeal the 1707 act of union , with the future to be determined by a scottish referendum in 2014 .
we believe in banknotes because we collectively decide to trust the government when it says that 100 is 100 , not 10 or 50 .
money , therefore , is about trust , without which no society can function .
just as we obey our leaders ’ orders to fight and die because we trust their judgment , we entrust our careers and our money to those who run citigroup and goldman sachs and other such banks , because we believe their leaders will be fair to their employees and clients , and honorable in their business practices .
we do not grow up wishing to work for crooks and liars .
once that trust breaks , bad things happen .
ultimately , of course , the soviet union ’s ossified structure could not be saved ; but , thanks in large part to gorbachev ’s fundamental decency , the ussr ’s demise in 1991 was rather peaceful .
he created an environment in which demands for radical change led to compromise , not rage – in sharp contrast to , say , the violent breakup of yugoslavia .
like francis and sanders , gorbachev was an improbable reformer .
despite rising to power with the support of the kgb , he did not surrender his thought processes to that machine , in the way that president vladimir putin clearly has .
likewise , far from fitting the mold of the democratic machine , sanders is working to pull the party back “ to the social democratic left where it belongs . ”
america ’s agricultural subsidies do just that .
those in the developing world who believe that there has been a history of bargaining in bad faith have a strong case .
that leaves developing countries facing a hard choice : will they be better off accepting the crumbs being offered to them ?
whatever the economics , taking this route may be harder today than ever before : with so many developing countries becoming vibrant democracies , electorates may punish governments that accept what is widely viewed as another unfair trade agreement .
unsurprisingly , the rich countries ’ negotiators throw around big numbers when describing the gains from even an imperfect agreement .
princeton – recently , physicists at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) – the world ’s most powerful particle accelerator , located near geneva at the european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) – announced that the celebrated discovery in 2012 of the higgs boson was indeed the higgs boson .
now , the standard model of particle physics is complete , except for one important thing : black holes .
four years ago , doomsayers forecast that the lhc would produce microscopic black holes that would swallow the earth in a matter of months .
the latter-day nostradamuses provoked widespread fear , not to mention lawsuits , about high-energy particle physics experiments .
these prophets were , of course , neither the first nor the last of their species .
monetary policy has long played an important role in brazilian politics .
during the democratization process of the 1980s and 1990s , successive governments tried to tame hyperinflation , which reached 2,477 % in 1993 .
the introduction of the “ real plan , ” launched in 1994 , managed to suppress annual price growth to an “ acceptable ” 22 % by the following year .
riding on the plan ’s success , its architect , fernando henrique cardoso , a former economy minister , was twice elected president ( in 1994 and 1998 ) , underscoring voter concern about price stability .
today , as central bankers in developed countries fret about the threat of deflation , brazilian politicians are once again forced to respond to widespread fears about slowing growth and a return to high inflation .
not surprisingly , the atmosphere at this year ’s world economic forum was grim .
those who think that globalization , technology , and the market economy will solve the world ’s problems seemed subdued .
most chastened of all were the bankers .
against the backdrop of the sub-prime crisis , the disasters at many financial institutions , and the weakening of the stock market , these “ masters of the universe ” seemed less omniscient than they did a short while ago .
and it was not just the bankers who were in the davos doghouse this year , but also their regulators – the central bankers .
now , given the profound sovereign-debt crisis in the eurozone periphery , government defaults threaten to take down the big banks .
the european central bank has provided a great deal of emergency “ liquidity ” funding to banks , which they use to buy even more government debt .
this holds down interest rates on that debt in the short run , but creates even bigger potential losses in the case of potential default .
banks and politics are deeply intertwined in all advanced economies .
diamond discovered that , ultimately , politicians trump bankers – at least in the uk .
despite low average growth rates , the income of the bottom quintile of the population grew by more than 6 % annually in the 2000 ’s , owing largely to cost-effective social policies .
provided that the government continues to pursue a comprehensive poverty-reduction strategy – including improved access to health care , financial services , and education – brazil ’s overall productivity should improve in the coming years .
even so , brazil has a long way to go .
for starters , anemic investment in traditional infrastructure since the 1980 ’s has become an increasingly heavy drag on tfp , contributing to waste and inefficiency in existing production systems .
this could be addressed by fine-tuning the division of labor in infrastructure investment and management between the public and private sectors , with the goal of crowding in the latter .
in the period following the oil shocks of the 1970s until the early 1980s , almost two-thirds of the countries recorded inflation rates above 10 % .
according to the latest data , which runs through july or august for most countries , there are “ only ” 14 cases of high inflation ( the red line in the figure ) .
venezuela ( which has not published official inflation statistics this year ) and argentina ( which has not released reliable inflation data for several years ) figure prominently in this group .
iran , russia , syria , ukraine , and a handful of african countries comprise the rest .
the share of countries recording outright deflation in consumer prices ( the green line ) is higher in 2015 than that of countries experiencing double-digit inflation ( 7 % of the total ) .
for the most part , the quick fixes they have imposed so far have not been very successful .
in the case of higher education , there is of course an alternative .
in the absence of sufficient funds , one can simply let the universities deteriorate .
on the european continent this has been happening since the 1970s .
overcrowded classes in often inadequate physical surroundings without necessary equipment have led to ever longer periods of study , a deterioration in the quality of degrees , and much unhappiness among both students and professors .
only war 's bloodshed , sad to say , can seal such a diplomatic bargain .
the need of kosova to be freed from milosevic 's grip has been so evident for a whole decade .
two million kosovars suffered from milosevic 's rule in every aspect of their lives , from basic security to education .
for years they tried to express their grievances through peaceful means .
as a political activist in the final days of yugoslavia , i tried to build upon the philosophy of nonviolence , leading demonstrations and other forms of peaceful forms of dissent .
the phenomenon took many forms , including the muslim brotherhood , founded in 1928 .
at the same time , efforts at nation-building along secular lines were reflected in egyptian president gamal abdel nasser ’s pan-arabism and the syrian baath party , resulting in the establishment of the united arab republic , a union between egypt and syria that lasted from 1958 to 1961 .
a half-century later , the simultaneous revolts in the arab world were the result of neither political tendency , instead reflecting broad popular rejection of dysfunctional and corrupt authoritarian governments .
but , with syria immersed in a brutal civil war that has claimed more than 130,000 lives already , libya on the verge of collapse , and egypt returning power to the army and proscribing the muslim brotherhood , tunisia has been the only success .
tunisia adopted its new constitution on january 27 , thus clearing the way for what will be the most secular and fairest elections in any of the region ’s countries .
berlin – the way we eat in the industrialized world is unhealthy , unjust , and unsustainable .
far too much of the meat we consume is produced under questionable ecological , ethical , and social conditions .
and now our industrial model for meat production is being exported to the global south – especially india and china – where meat consumption is rising among these countries ’ emerging middle classes .
worldwide , 300 million tons of meat are produced each year , and the united nations food and agriculture organization estimates that the annual amount will increase to 455 million tons by 2050 if demand continues to grow at the current rate .
such large amounts of meat can be produced only on an industrial scale , and at high social , political , and ecological costs .
cambridge – for some time , the four horsemen of us macroeconomic policymaking have been taxation , regulation , trade , and infrastructure .
having studied the first in detail , i have found tax cuts to be a positive contributor to economic growth .
though i have considered the second area in less detail , the evidence suggests that regulation is , at best , only a minor contributor to growth .
the third area is very important , which is why today ’s trade tensions are so worrying .
the fourth area exists only in rhetoric : an infrastructure program is currently not a part of the macroeconomic policy repertoire .
as gordon notes , there have been long-lasting productivity dividends associated with urbanization – a trend that could continue for at least another decade in china .
but there will come a time when this tailwind subsides and china begins to converge on the so-called frontier of the advanced economies .
at that point , china will face the same productivity challenges that confront america and others .
chinese policymakers ’ new focus on innovation-led growth seems to recognize this risk .
without powerful innovations , sustaining productivity growth will be an uphill battle .
but the plan was projected to depress economic activity even further , and failed to establish an appropriate basis for calculating how much debt restructuring puerto rico would need .
sadly , the opportunity to right puerto rico ’s fiscal ship has not been seized .
on the contrary , the oversight board recently certified a new fiscal plan and a deal with holders of bonds issued by the puerto rico urgent interest fund corporation ( cofina ) that could put the island in a debt straitjacket indefinitely .
at $ 17.8 billion , the stock of cofina bonds ( which are backed by future sales-tax revenues ) accounts for more than one-third of the total debt in the new fiscal plan .
and the cofina deal is itself part of a larger debt-restructuring effort that is based on an unrealistic assessment of the commonwealth ’s economic conditions .
ten years on , what impact have the principles had on displaced people ’s lives ?
the achievements are notable , if insufficient .
we have raised awareness of the plight of the displaced , brought about changes in government policies , and raised billions of dollars to respond to their basic needs .
this has helped save countless lives .
humanitarian efforts continue to be strengthened , including through a new rapid funding mechanism , the un central emergency response fund .
wearing a watch that costs 200 times more than one that does a better job of keeping time says something else , even when it is worn by people who are not governing a relatively poor country .
andrew carnegie , the richest man of veblen ’s era , was blunt in his moral judgments .
“ the man who dies rich , ” he is often quoted as saying , “ dies disgraced . ”
we can adapt that judgment to the man or woman who wears a $ 30,000 watch or buys similar luxury goods , like a $ 12,000 handbag .
essentially , such a person is saying ; “ i am either extraordinarily ignorant , or just plain selfish .
he shows that both the “ total ” and “ average ” answers have paradoxical or counter-intuitive implications .
but then , so does every other answer that has been proposed since parfit revived the problem and other philosophers began to offer their own solutions .
if reasons and persons could easily have been three separate books , on what matters really is : the first two volumes were published in 2011 , while a third , in press when parfit died , has just appeared .
in this monumental work , totaling about 1,900 pages , parfit challenges the idea – almost universally assumed by economists , and by many philosophers from david hume onward – that the role of reason is to tell us how to get what we want , but not to tell us what to want .
on the contrary , parfit argued , desires can be irrational .
by acknowledging mental health and wellness issues at work , we can make a difference in our homes , schools , and communities as well .
seeking mental health care should be as routine and unremarkable as seeking treatment for high blood pressure , diabetes , or a heart condition .
furthermore , we must reduce mental health inequity , a frequently ignored issue .
this is often a problem in lower-income communities , where populations may be at greater risk of pathology and often face the highest obstacles to getting care , in part owing to a lack of the specialized resources available in wealthier areas .
there are some innovative approaches to addressing this problem , such as zimbabwe ’s friendship bench , and i look forward to learning more about this project from one of its representatives in davos .
experts argue that the probability of a terrorist attack because of the dubai takeover is small .
should the damage inflicted by a terrorist attack also be small , there would be no problem .
but the damage inflicted by an attack might be tremendous , because ports are thought to be one of the few ways terrorists might smuggle nuclear weapons into the us .
because of this , americans ca n’t afford to take even the minutest of chances with their ports – the consequences of error being too staggering to contemplate .
the american public understands this , even if their president does not .
but four political developments that have modified the international security agenda are likely to transform chicago into a high-profile summit in its own right .
first , the revolutions in the arab world and nato ’s military intervention in libya have refocused the alliance ’s attention on the middle east and northern africa .
second , the international financial crisis will have an immense impact on nato members ’ defense budgets .
third , in a speech last june , outgoing us secretary of defense robert gates revived the debate on transatlantic burden-sharing and solidarity within the alliance .
finally , the first nato summit to be held in the united states in 13 years is taking place not only in an election year , but also in president barack obama ’s hometown .
yet smallholders can not be ignored when it comes to climate-change solutions : the world ’s half-billion small farms account for 60 % of global agriculture production and provide up to 80 % of the food supply in developing countries .
together , they manage vast areas of our planet , including 80 % of the farmland in sub-saharan africa and asia .
can we really count on these farmers , many of them desperately poor , to take a leading role in addressing the twin challenges of food security and environmental sustainability ?
can they produce more food while protecting the natural environment ?
we believe the answer to both questions is a resounding yes .
one such reform would be to expand access for foreign investors .
over the last decade , foreigners have been barred from making investments in more than 40 industries designated “ critical for national security ” by the government .
this ban , while beneficial for industry insiders , has reduced russia ’s access to financial markets and , more critical , to new technologies , which follow the financial flows .
the financial sanctions that followed russia ’s forced “ reunification with crimea ” in 2014 intensified russia ’s isolation further , as has the country ’s own moves to retaliate : a series of sweeping trade restrictions , including outright bans of food imports from the european union and the us .
lifting these restrictions would not only give the economy an immediate boost , but also increase long-term gdp growth .
the relationship between the cee countries and the uk has always been somewhat fraught .
in the 1990s , the uk was a proponent of eu membership for cee countries at a time when leaders in france and germany were still very hesitant about eu enlargement .
but uk support had a catch : british leaders , reluctant to accept the eu ’s long-stated goal of an “ ever-closer union ” – which implies political unification and shared national and federal sovereignty – made no secret of their desire to use the widening of eu membership to prevent the deepening of european integration .
during the negotiations with eu leaders ahead of the referendum , british prime minister david cameron obtained an opt-out clause in the case of a decision to move toward ever-closer union .
should he prevail in the referendum and convince voters to stay , it will send a dangerous signal to illiberal politicians in eastern europe .
and workers of the future will require training in ethics , to help them navigate a world in which the value of human beings can no longer be taken for granted .
educators preparing students for this future must start now .
business majors should study economic and political history to avoid becoming blind determinists .
economists must learn from engineering students , as it will be engineers building the future workforce .
and law students should focus on the intersection of big data and human rights , so that they gain the insight that will be needed to defend people from forces that may seek to turn individuals into disposable parts .
the top-down hierarchy is autocratic and arbitrary ; lower levels have little collaborative input and no right of appeal .
serious breaches can result in reprimands or dismissals .
in effect , the system has become largely self-regulating .
in my experience , 99 % of all censorship occurs with the writers and producers themselves .
sporadic complaints and warnings from above enable them to develop an intuitive sense for the boundaries of acceptable content , so they create shows that are free from offending material from the outset .
tokyo – japanese prime minister shinzo abe has decided to extend the diet ’s current session for 95 days , until september 27 – making for the longest continuous session in the japanese parliament ’s postwar history .
the reason is clear : abe is determined to pass a set of national security bills allowing a reinterpretation of japan ’s constitution that enables the country to play a greater role not only in enhancing its own security , but also in advancing world peace .
abe ’s actions in the diet come on the heels of his performance at the recent g-7 summit in germany , where he broke with japanese tradition .
for the previous 39 years , japanese representatives to the g-7 had focused on the economic discussions at such meetings , content to remain largely silent as the industrialized world ’s other leaders surveyed the planet ’s political hot spots and recommended action or , more often , inaction .
but the summit showed that japan no longer intends to stand on the diplomatic sidelines .
in february 1996 , kohl urged that nato put enlargement on hold until the russian and us presidential elections passed .
he instructed ministers not to discuss the matter publicly and suggested that talks not be left in the hands of the nato machinery alone .
to underline this , the chancellor 's first foreign policy activity after returning from his summer 's vacation was a visit , in early september , to the ailing boris yeltsin , with whom kohl has friendly relations .
this visit yielded another appeal not to rush nato enlargement .
in germany 's parliament , the chancellor announced that yeltsin , after his operation , would " renew the necessary dialogue and address specific issues more urgently , such as nato enlargement ... and i have been able . . to reach agreement with president clinton , president chirac and prime minister major that we would now refrain firmly from dealing with the important matter of nato-enlargement in some framework so that moscow does not feel we are creating a fiat accompli . "
only this , fogel believes , can explain recent trends in longevity , body size , the durability of vital organs , and chronic diseases .
these changes are also triggering changes in human consciousness .
the result is a litany of " post-utopian " values that include a stronger emphasis on individual freedom and personal responsibility .
in this world without utopia , individual freedom is the supreme value .
but , as with any change of such magnitude , there are holdouts .
london – the gravity of the eurozone crisis has finally sunk in .
the stakes could not be higher .
governments and international financial institutions have scrambled to put together a solution within exceedingly tight political and economic constraints .
many questions have yet to be answered about the design ; implementation will be at least as challenging .
eurozone leaders must now aim to preserve not only the single currency , but also the gains from financial integration in europe .
washington , dc – while much of the developed world is properly worried about myriad privacy outrages at the hands of big tech and demanding – and securing – for individuals a “ right to be forgotten , ” many around the world are posing a very different question : what about the right to be seen ?
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
drug-related violence has consumed untold numbers of victims in afghanistan , burma , colombia , the us , and mexico .
the swiss re-examined their government ’s drug policies with a pragmatic eye .
health professionals took the lead in a campaign to press the government – through the mechanisms of direct democracy – to shift its focus from arresting and punishing drug users toward public-health policies that are based on scientific evidence of what works .
the swiss implemented methadone programs . and , in order to prevent the spread of hiv , they created needle exchanges , including in prisons , and established safe injection rooms on a large scale .
the swiss federal office of public health also oversaw an experiment in prescribing heroin to people who had lived with opiate dependency for significant periods .
washington , dc – the impact that groundbreaking technological advances like artificial intelligence will have on the functioning of our economies and labor markets has been a hot topic for a long time .
but jerry kaplan ’s recent book humans need not apply : a guide to wealth and work in the age of artificial intelligence has impressed upon me the true size of the socioeconomic stakes .
one relatively well-known example of the digital revolution ’s impact on the workings of markets is the ability to earn huge returns in high-speed trading by being a microsecond “ ahead ” of everyone else .
another is the capacity for price discrimination by new electronic market makers like uber , which thus appropriate every penny of the old “ consumer surplus ” of microeconomic theory .
soon a new kind of enhanced uber could emerge , integrating car , bus , ship , airplane travel , and hotel rooms into one super-app .
in a world of limited resources , policymakers must prioritize their investments , including by differentiating the necessary from the desirable .
to that end , finding ways to identify and maximize complementarity is vital .
some 2.1 billion people worldwide lack access to safe , readily available water at home , and more than twice as many – a whopping 4.5 billion – lack safely managed sanitation , severely undermining health outcomes and fueling river pollution .
with a growing share of the world ’s population – including many of the same people – feeling the effects of environmental degradation and climate change firsthand , finding solutions that simultaneously advance environmental protection , water provision , and health could not be more important .
global health and conservation professionals must cooperate more closely to find those solutions – and convince policymakers to pursue them .
this is an unwelcome development for software providers whose business model is based on licensing and annual maintenance fees , not electricity usage .
indeed , large companies in almost every field are vulnerable , as start-ups become better equipped , more competitive , and capable , like larger firms , of reaching customers and users everywhere .
moreover , disruptive technologies will cause value to shift among economic sectors , as occurred when television overtook radio or , more recently , when online media gained predominance over print publication .
businesses in all sectors now must invest in understanding new technologies , so that they are prepared to seize opportunities or mount an effective defense quickly .
indeed , ceos and other top executives need to be technologists , or at least technology-savvy , and constantly assess how innovations will affect the status quo , specifically their profit pools .
by 2013 , the proportion had dropped to 13.5 % .
though the developing world had 1.7 billion more people than in 1991 , 209 million fewer were starving .
over the past 22 years , the world has managed to feed almost two billion more people adequately – no small feat .
over the next year , the world ’s 193 governments will come together to set new global targets to be met by 2030 .
the task amounts to this generation ’s greatest opportunity to translate high aspirations into concrete targets .
fifteen people were killed and many more injured in what is remembered as the peterloo massacre .
given the recent memory of the violent french revolution , the british elite reluctantly agreed to democratizing reforms .
ultimately , the reform act of 1832 abolished the rotten boroughs and extended the franchise to the new middle class ( the working class and women would have to wait ) .
the united states , too , went though a period of robber-baron industrialization in the 1870 ’s and 1880 ’s .
the greed and corruption of that era were satirized in 1873 by mark twain and charles dudley warner in their book the gilded age : a tale of today .
but thanks to farage – and the faragism that has taken over the governing conservative party – an act of economic self-harm that clearly runs counter to the national interest is portrayed as the apotheosis of british patriotism .
narrow-minded nationalism is not simply a british disease : across the west , much of the public sees globalization as leaderless , lacking a human face , and akin to an uncontrollable runaway train .
moderate leaders everywhere must now respond not only to the economic discontent of millions who are losing out , but also to the cultural pessimism and the dismissal of politicians as being “ in it only for themselves ” that are giving succor to the populist nationalism promoted by trump cheerleader stephen bannon and his ilk .
what makes it so much worse in britain , however , is a series of gross errors of political judgment during and after the 2016 referendum campaign .
while the defeated remain side waged an economic campaign centered on fear of jobs losses from exiting the eu , the victorious leave side waged a culture war by exaggerating fears of immigration and asserting the need for patriotic britons to “ take back control . ”
a survey of existing laws and regulations found that many of them were contradictory and overlapping .
ande proposed creation of a new court by amending the constitution .
it was successful due to strong public support for combating corruption .
the new court is empowered to reconcile or revoke laws that contain conflicts and duplications .
each firm and business association must decide on the best strategies and tactics to pursue in their countries .
how did ukraine reach this state of cynicism ?
a year ago , everyone gathered in the streets of kyiv knew what we were standing up against : a corrupt government that sought to command life and labor , and to dispose of state property , at its will .
in so far as formal legal rights existed , no court could be relied upon to enforce those rights when our rulers saw their interests as challenged .
in evicting that regime , we believed that this form of absolutism was ended .
instead , those who benefited from the regime = s corruptions insisted that their rights to the property they had stolen were inviolate .
one community was provided with continuous access to a micronutrient and protein supplement called atole .
in addition , health workers visited mothers during pregnancy and provided free medical services .
another community nearby had the same program , except that the micronutrient supplement was provided without protein .
for the children who received atole , the risk of stunting fell by more than one-half .
they stayed in school longer , learned more , scored higher on cognitive tests in adulthood , and were more likely to be employed in higher-paying , skilled jobs .
from day one , the coalition was riven by feuds .
ministers acted like adversaries rather than partners .
instead of blaming iliescu for the shambles in which he left the country , coalition members blamed each other .
such squabbling , it seems , is a postcommunist malady .
poland , hungary , even russia : in all three , infighting among reformers allowed the political heirs to the communists to reclaim power .
though the economy was at full employment , they rebelled against the status quo in the name of dubious utopias inspired by fidel castro ’s cuba and mao ’s china .
they were joined by well-organized trade unions that helped the movement reach a critical mass , at least temporarily .
the difference between then and now is that those taking to the streets to protest against macron ’s proposed fuel-tax increase are animated not by utopia but by despair .
in this sense , the yellow vest uprising is not unlike a french brexit , in that it amounts to an act of shooting oneself in the foot .
whereas the british resorted to the ballot box , the french have adopted a mixture of barricades , marches , and stone throwing .
she remembers everything and regrets nothing .
she feels that , in acting as she did , she was faithful to her most cherished values and beliefs .
and she has no doubt that the west , in responding to the arab league ’s entreaty to intervene , avoided a replay of srebrenica in north africa .
what strikes me the most is that she sees , even then , the beginnings of the tribal conflicts and the coming contest among islamists to outdo one another in fundamentalist purity .
she worries about the early violations of human rights , particularly women ’s rights , which she fears will multiply .
over the last six months , the us has abandoned its four-decade-old policy of engagement with china , adopting a containment strategy instead .
facing escalating geopolitical competition with the us , china is scrambling to win friends in the region .
although china ’s charm offensive is very recent , its contours are already clear .
the most prominent feature is trade .
as the largest trading partner of numerous asian countries , china will offer attractive trade terms to its neighbors , much as it has done with singapore .
london – “ shorting ” is a tactic well known among the financial cognoscenti .
it means betting against an asset with borrowed money in the expectation of making a profit when its value goes down .
a speculator can “ short ” a government by borrowing its debt at its current price , in the hope of selling it later at a lower price and pocketing the difference .
for example : on january 1 , 2010 , i think to myself that the game will soon be up for the greeks .
i borrow , at face value , € 10 million of the greek government ’s 2016 bond , which is then trading at € 0.91 , from goldman sachs for six months .
indeed , the lack of restrictions has enabled dubious journalistic practices to flourish .
jordan ’s diverse tribal composition was reflected in newly established web sites , some of which were created with tacit support – and even funding – from security agencies or other official or political groups .
moreover , many people launched news web sites exclusively for financial gain .
taking advantage of the implicit authority of news media , they published any potentially damaging rumor about individuals or groups with means and influence , then offered to remove the story in exchange for a paid advertisement or a direct cash payment .
in response to such extortionary practices , king abdullah ii decried “ character assassination ” by online news media and demanded that the government establish a regulatory framework for this unruly new sector .
the poison of terrorism has now ripped into the humanitarian work of the un , with the tragic bombing of its iraq mission 's headquarters .
dozens of innocent people were killed , including one of the world 's most accomplished peacemakers , sergio vieira de mello .
predictably , president bush re-stated his determination to wage war on terrorism .
other leaders declared that the un should not abandon its mission .
yet the bombing raises political questions that demand answers .
but they are really illegal occupiers , as russia ’s decision to give russian passports to these regions ’ residents attests .
now russia is threatening to recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia if the west recognizes the serbian province of kosovo as an independent nation .
to the extent that most of the residents of abkhazia and south ossetia have already been given russian citizenship , the recognition of those two regions ’ sovereignty would be entirely fictitious and , in fact , an interim measure on the way to their full annexation by russia .
to strengthen russia ’s political influence over georgia ’s separatist regions , gazprom , without taking the trouble to ask for permission from georgia ’s democratically elected leaders , has begun constructing a gas pipeline connecting russia and south ossetia directly .
although there was no interruption of gas supply from tbilisi to south ossetia , this step is necessary for the kremlin to ensure even greater integration of this georgian region into russia ’s economic system .
back then , german bankers and bosses deluded themselves into thinking that they could control their country ’s vulgar new chancellor .
and they were convinced that , despite hitler ’s strange behavior and appearance , he remained the best defense against communism .
sadly , many of today ’s elites seem to have learned nothing from history , and think and act as if interests and values were totally disconnected from each other in the real world .
so long as trump is good for business , they appear unconcerned that he is the single biggest threat to america ’s soul and values , and to its image and interests abroad .
sure , they say , trump may be going a bit too far with the chinese on trade , but at least he has been asking them the right questions .
even more worryingly , this would open the door for provisions outlawing the benign , low-risk data mining that drives online advertising .
online advertising allows eu citizens to access information , educational material , commerce channels , and entertainment sites without paying for them directly , and the amount being spent on it in europe is growing fast .
the industry ’s revenues have more than quadrupled since 2006 , even as the overall european economy has stagnated .
the eu ’s privacy crackdown threatens to undermine all of this .
not only will it create an administrative burden through additional costs and bureaucratic hassles ; it also raises the real possibility that the new rules will undermine the business model of many of europe ’s most prominent online companies .
when programs are developed in conjunction with rigorous research , the effect can be dramatic .
for example , a joint soas-oxford study on menstruation in uganda found that adolescent girls often missed school because they did n’t have access to clean sanitary products .
but when reusable sanitary pads and education about menstruation were provided to girls in eight schools , attendance rose by an average of 17 % . the global-health community must work together to address the menstrual needs of women and girls everywhere ; there is no single solution to this global problem .
but the silence surrounding the natural process of menstruation must be broken , so that women and girls can obtain the sanitary products they need at affordable prices .
today , bloody good period donates sanitary products – including pads and tampons , as well as diapers and toiletries – to more than a dozen uk resource centers for asylum-seekers every month .
but , for many revolutionaries , there were other ways to sack a tainted prosecutor and cleanse the judiciary .
for example , a new law regulating the judiciary has been a demand of the revolution since its early weeks .
for morsi , the dilemma was that the constitutional court could strike down the law , rendering the effort meaningless .
he had already backed off twice : once in july 2012 , when he abandoned his effort , under pressure from the supreme council of the armed forces , to reinstate the elected parliament ; and once when he tried to remove the public prosecutor by making him egypt ’s ambassador to the holy see .
morsi ’s “ constitutional declaration ” was a decisive – though undemocratic , polarizing , and thus politically costly – step to break the impasse .
moreover , it amounts to a betrayal of the longstanding us commitment to uphold a rules-based monetary system that discourages competitive currency devaluation .
in foreign policy , us secretary of state rex tillerson has endorsed the revival of the monroe doctrine – the nineteenth-century assertion of us primacy in the western hemisphere that aimed to keep out european competitors – in central and south america , in order to curb china ’s growing influence .
tillerson ’s nostalgia for 1823 was not shared south of the border , where , as one mexican commentator pointed out , the monroe doctrine “ served to justify gringo interventions , ” and where china ’s increasing engagement is viewed as a counterweight to the us .
the trump administration has also unveiled a new , more aggressive nuclear policy .
its nuclear posture review proposes using nuclear strikes in response to non-nuclear threats , and deploying new “ low-yield ” nuclear devices that would deliver by submarine a nuclear bomb equivalent in power to those that destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 .
in other emerging markets , too , the main challenge is to ensure that all macroeconomic and structural policies advance common goals .
at the same time , the governance structure of multilateral institutions like the international monetary fund must be reformed , in order to bolster their legitimacy in emerging markets .
otherwise , these institutions will remain ineffective in confronting collective problems related to macroeconomic-policy spillovers , and in providing insurance against crises .
policymakers in advanced and emerging countries alike should focus on the underlying failures that destabilize their economies and impede growth , rather than trying to treat the symptoms by manipulating monetary policy or capital controls .
unless they are supported by strong institutional structures at all levels , such measures will prove futile in managing capital flows .
the economic challenges facing developed-country middle classes are largely the result of two factors : the rapid loss of white - and blue-collar routine jobs to automation , and the shift of middle and lower value-added jobs to countries with lower labor costs .
the latter pattern depressed income and wage growth not only in the tradable sector directly , but also in the non-tradable service sectors , owing to the spillover of displaced labor .
the result was surplus labor conditions in the middle - and lower-middle-income ranges , not dissimilar to the surplus labor in early-stage developing countries , where it suppresses income growth ( for a period of time ) even as the economy expands .
a decline in the bargaining power of labor and a falling real minimum wage may have also contributed to income polarization , though these are probably secondary factors .
though the challenges facing the middle class are well documented , us leaders have largely failed to recognize fully the struggles of middle-class households , much less implement effective countermeasures .
zurich – finland ’s central bank governor , olli rehn , has reiterated his call for the european central bank to conduct a long-overdue review of its policy framework .
the upcoming change of leadership at the institution – with christine lagarde , the international monetary fund ’s managing director since 2011 , likely to succeed mario draghi as president – offers an important opportunity to heed that call .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
such scenarios were unimaginable until only recently .
for decades , europe has constituted the world ’s most successful , stable , and predictable region , a place where history seemed to have all but ended .
the goal of making the continent peaceful , whole , and free had largely been realized .
but dramatic change has come to europe .
one factor is the willingness and ability shown by vladimir putin ’s russia to use military force , economic coercion , and cyber manipulation to advance its agenda .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
batang toru is just one of many planned infrastructure projects worldwide that are officially deemed environmentally sound , despite posing serious environmental risks .
for example , construction is nearly complete on a railway line through kenya ’s famous nairobi national park , despite public outrage over an “ incomplete and incompetent ” environmental impact assessment .
in many ways , these measures succeeded : monetary expansion played a major role in pulling the economy back from the brink .
but , over time , central banks ’ capacity to affect the real economy declined .
today – and for the foreseeable future – domestic inflation is increasingly affected by global , rather than local , developments , and financial ( in ) stability and fiscal policy are far more influential than monetary policy .
for the ecb , this generates a particularly serious challenge .
after all , unlike other central banks , it must account for the preferences of 19 sovereign national governments , with little to no structural or fiscal-policy coordination .
today , the fastest-growing cities are in asia .
beijing is roughly 10 ° c hotter than the nearby countryside in the daytime and 5.5 ° c warmer at night .
there are even more dramatic increases in tokyo .
in august , temperatures there climbed 12.5 oc above the surrounding countryside , reaching 40oc – a scorching heat that affected not only the downtown area , but also covered some 8,000 square kilometers .
looking at a fast-growing city like houston , texas , we can see the real effect of the urban heat island .
some people saw these changes happening , and worried about them .
a growing minority started to pursue intense physical activity not in fields or factories , but in leisure settings .
the sweat of one ’s brow was no longer associated with productive work , but with consumption – often conspicuous consumption .
gyms became new sources of community .
and as coworkers started to exercise together , enlightened employers came to see such recreation as a valuable source of physical and mental wellbeing .
according to the european council on foreign relations , 32 referenda are being demanded in 18 countries across the eu .
some , such as the danish people ’s party , want to follow the united kingdom ’s lead and hold a vote on eu membership .
others want to escape from the eurozone , block the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) with the united states , or restrict labor mobility .
the eu ’s refugee relocation scheme has proved to be particularly divisive .
hungarian prime minister viktor orbán has declared that he will hold a referendum on the proposed quotas .
from the outset of his presidency , obama ’s defense of a liberal trade regime has been inadequate .
he has said repeatedly that exports are good for the us : they create jobs .
but us exports are other nations ’ imports , so obama ’s argument amounts to telling others to lose their jobs .
he needs to remind americans that imports are also good : he can surely ask his audience to think of jobs in the ups cargo planes , freight trains , and trucks that carry imports into the american interior .
the main problem , however , is that obama has been unable to confront , and put to rest , us labor unions ’ fear-driven hostility to trade .
usury ( making money from money ) was an offense against god .
it was only in the eighteenth century that greed became morally respectable .
it was now considered healthily promethean to turn wealth into money and put it to work to make more money , because by doing this one was benefiting humanity .
this inspired the american way of life , where money always talks .
the end of capitalism means simply the end of the urge to listen to it .
instead of focusing on treatment that works , the polish government chooses to give priority to long-term rehabilitation centers located in the depths of the countryside that have little , if anything , to do with evidence-based medicine .
poland also chooses to treat possession of even the smallest quantities of drugs as criminal , as evidenced by the fact that 60 % of people sentenced for drug possession in poland are marijuana smokers .
addressing drug use through criminalization and rehabilitation centers does nothing to curb demand , however , and usage rates have failed to decline .
by driving users underground , criminalization contributes to a deepening public-health crisis .
this pattern persists across central and eastern europe , where governments have also opted to imprison drug users .
frankfurt – the european central bank is in the middle of a big , risky experiment .
key interest rates have remained close to zero for six years now .
financial markets are flooded with liquidity .
crisis management has resulted in major market distortions , with some segments ’ performance no longer explainable by fundamental economic data .
the unintended consequences of this policy are increasingly visible – and will become increasingly tangible with the us federal reserve ’s exit from post-2008 ultra-loose monetary policy .
the alliance has evolved into a true security-management organization that is flexible , efficient , and cost-effective .
the threats have changed , and become more global , and we have changed to meet them .
nato is developing a ballistic-missile defense capability to protect our european populations and territory against a grave and growing threat .
in the indian ocean , nato is working with the european union and many others to police major sea lanes threatened by pirates .
and , in countries around the world , it carries out tasks such as de-mining , disaster relief , advising on how to bring military forces under democratic control , and working closely with the un to prevent harm to children .
to promote sales , buyers are exempted from sales and excise taxes ( $ 6,000 - $ 10,000 per vehicle ) .
and , anticipating the eventual replacement of conventional motor vehicles globally , the authorities are providing generous subsidies for domestic manufacturing .
meanwhile , the trump administration is trying to turn back the clock , by betting on the resuscitation of a dying – and deadly – fossil-fuel industry .
describing a transition to electric vehicles as a job killer , trump has advocated ending federal subsidies that encourage domestic development , manufacture , and purchase , such as the $ 7,500 federal tax credit for consumers .
china ’s dependence on fossil fuels has left it in a deep environmental hole , but its leaders are determined to climb out .
provided that it is non-discriminatory , such border pricing would enhance global welfare and be compatible with world trade organization rules .
but calculating the appropriate tax would be very difficult in practice .
it would , for example , necessitate calculating the tax equivalent of regulatory ceilings .
the measure may also invite countries like the united states to retaliate with distortive measures , making it somewhat perilous .
moreover , the tax would likely have regressive distributional consequences , hurting poor countries the most .
eurozone countries , together with others willing to join the euro in the future ( the “ eurozone plus ” ) , could simply decide to use the legal means already available to increase cooperation .
ideally , this cooperation would take place within the eu ’s institutional framework .
if all eurozone members participated , article 136 of the treaty on the functioning of the eu could be used to support their action.the scope of this provision – which says that , “ the [ european ] council shall … adopt measures specific to [ euro ] member states , ” and that “ only [ euro ] member states … shall take part in the vote ” – is wide .
in addition , article 138 would allow unified representation of the eurozone in the international monetary fund and the world bank .
the group could then extend cooperation to three other policy areas :
gunnarsdóttir accepts that “ everyone has the right to believe in what they want , ” but she insists that , “ the rights of children come above the right to believe . ”
for his part , imam ahmad seddeeq of the islamic cultural center of iceland has countered that circumcision is a part of the muslim faith , and that gunnarsdóttir ’s bill amounts to “ a contravention [ of ] religious freedom . ”
and agnes m. sigurðardóttir , the bishop of iceland , has warned that the ban would effectively turn judaism and islam into “ criminalized religions , ” because anyone practicing circumcision could be subject to six years in jail .
complicating matters further , both sides base their arguments on human rights .
for example , some supporters of the ban have argued that circumcision violates article 5 of the universal declaration of human rights ( udhr ) , which states that , “ no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment . ”
but policy analysts can not limit themselves to the classic instruments of nuclear deterrence – punishment and denial – as they assess the possibility of deterrence and dissuasion in cyberspace .
they should also pay attention to the mechanisms of entanglement and norms .
entanglement can alter the cost-benefit calculation of a major state such as china , but it probably has little effect on a state such as north korea , which is weakly linked to the world economy .
“ persistent engagement ” can , however , aid deterrence in such difficult cases .
of course , entering any adversary ’s network and disrupting attacks poses a danger of escalation .
confirmation of a stricter and more rigorous stability pact is also imperative to achieve greater integration .
here , the eu summit in december was an important step forward in terms of deepening political union and strengthening governance among the eurozone ’s member states .
nevertheless , more will be needed to restore financial stability , such as enlarging the total firepower of the european financial stability facility .
moreover , if we want the eu to emerge strengthened from the crisis , it must also strike a better balance between austerity and pro-growth policies , because , without growth and higher employment , the eurozone ’s problems can not be resolved .
more importantly , the eu must tie its economic strategies to long-term competitiveness , which is ultimately determined by the value added to goods and services .
in 2007 , the volume of shadow-banking transactions in the us exceeded that of conventional banking assets .
the financial stability board has estimated that total global shadow-banking assets in 2011 amounted to $ 67 trillion , with the us accounting for $ 23 trillion , the eurozone for $ 22 trillion , and the united kingdom for $ 9 trillion .
chinese shadow banking totals only about $ 2.2 trillion .
shadow banking in china is dominated by lending to higher-risk borrowers , such as local governments , property developers , and smes .
it is ultimately funded through retail bank deposits , banks ’ wealth-management products , and private equity .
in 2009 , obama envisioned a settlement of the conflict through the strong commitment of the international community .
in 2011 , he asserted that only both sides ’ willingness could ensure a successful outcome .
clearly , the us can not do much to resolve the conflict .
there is no overarching explanation for obama ’s successive middle east failures , but there are a few factors worth considering : the increase in the number of asymmetrical conflicts , in which the traditional use of force is largely ineffective ; increasingly blurred lines between difficult allies and intransigent adversaries ; and major political differences between a centrist us president and a congress that is dominated more than ever by extreme ideas .
but obama himself bears a large part of the blame .
as economists such as mit ’s david autor have shown the impact of this in developed countries can be both bad for some workers and good for company profits .
but it can be extremely good for any developing country that fosters a fruitful balance of inward investment and local entrepreneurship and uses the proceeds of export-led growth to invest in infrastructure and skills .
china ’s dramatic economic success would have been impossible without trade initially driven by labor-cost differences .
in the future , however , this type of trade will probably become less important .
with wages in china now rising rapidly , its labor-cost advantage is fast diminishing .
beijing – just how fast is china ’s population aging , and what does a lower proportion of working-age people mean for the country ’s economic development ?
can – and should – anything be done , particularly to the country ’s “ one child ” policy , to slow the trend ?
nowadays , most demographic predictions for china are based on the country ’s total fertility rate ( tfr ) of 1.8 – unchanged for 20 years .
but population-survey data published by the national bureau of statistics suggests that the tfr has been lower than 1.5 for many years , and the united nations ’ newly published report , world fertility patterns 2009 , revises china ’s tfr to 1.4 in 2006 , placing it among low-fertility countries .
a long period of low fertility means that china ’s population is aging and growth in the working-age population is slowing .
after the monetarist approach failed , some switched to targeting the inflation rate .
but they repeatedly missed their targets .
until the currency crashes of the 1990s , emerging and developing countries tended to target their exchange rates .
many then also switched to inflation targets ; but they tend to miss these targets even more often than the advanced countries do .
the problem with these approaches to monetary-policy targeting is that even though a particular numerical target may be reasonable when it is set , subsequent unexpected developments often make the target hard to live with .
in fact , the dangers that are now facing europe as a result of socializing debts are far greater than those posed by a mere potential financial crisis .
the lesson to be drawn from the greek debacle is that the eurozone must develop sovereign insolvency procedures as quickly as possible , thereby preventing other sovereigns from becoming creditors through debt mutualization .
if the european union ’s national governments want to help one another in a crisis , they should unilaterally provide humanitarian aid , without conditionality and without redemption .
if you lend to your friend , he will no longer be your friend .
unless that wisdom is heeded , it will be impossible to hold europe together .
finally , orbán and his supporters maintain their grip on power in part by relying on gerrymandering and voter suppression ( which mostly affects hungarians living in western europe ) .
trump ’s republican party uses similar tactics .
orbán is a pariah in european circles for having eroded hungarian democracy , yet trump recently welcomed him to the white house and described him as “ respected all over europe . ”
trump and his advisers evidently have learned a great deal from orbán about racist immigration policies and how to destroy a democracy .
they are not making america great or even good ; they are making it hungarian .
worse , orbán has destroyed the independence of hungary ’s civil service and thoroughly politicized the administration of the law .
trump is doing much the same , with the result that the us government now loses about 94 % of its regulatory court cases .
at the same time , trump has purged some 17,000 public officials by firing us state department employees , shutting down the government , freezing pay , and creating an atmosphere hostile to honest , open debate about how to formulate and implement policy .
by politicizing us administrative agencies , starting to capture the justice department , and committing himself to making ideological judicial appointments , trump is now far along in his quest to destroy the rule of law in america .
while orbán has applied economic pressure to force the closure of hungarian opposition media , trump has described the press as “ the enemy of the people ” and threatened libel actions against critical outlets .
but it is unclear from ayyadurai ’s article which data were used , and there is no validation of the model .
folta offers a brilliant send-up of ayyadurai ’s work .
“ if you developed a computer program that integrated internet data to predict the location of munich , and the program told you it was squarely in the gulf of mexico , right off florida , it does not mean that munich is in the gulf of mexico , right off of florida . ”
instead , it means that you have made a mistake , in your program , assumptions , or input data – all of which are testable .
to decide not to challenge those data , folta continues , and instead to “ publish a map showing that munich is squarely in the gulf of mexico , opposing all other data and the claims of millions of rather dry germans , does not mean that you are brilliant .
in other words : europe faces a fundamental collective-action problem .
experience has shown that only an acute crisis can force europe ’s leaders to act together in a concerted effort .
but , in the autumn of 2008 , at the height of the global financial crisis , eurozone heads of state did not consider the creation of a common bank-rescue fund .
instead , they settled for a package of national measures to stabilize national banking systems one by one .
the sum of the headline commitment was impressive , amounting to 20 % of gdp .
a 17-day war ensued , but the status quo prevailed .
the two sides fought again in 1971 , though kashmir was not the focus .
after the civil war pitting then-west pakistan against the bengali freedom fighters of then-east pakistan fueled a wave of refugees from the east , india began supporting rebel groups there .
west pakistan was forced to surrender , and east pakistan became the independent state of bangladesh .
then , in 1999 , another indo-pakistani skirmish over kashmir erupted , after pakistan sent troops to the indian-controlled district of kargil .
with the emergence in the 1980 ’s of hiv , which compromises the immune system , tb reemerged , and is the number-one killer of hiv-infected individuals .
roughly 15 million people suffer from co-infection of hiv and mycobacterium tuberculosis , the primary causative agent in most tb cases .
moreover , the tubercle bacillus engages in trench warfare , gaining resistance to conventional antibiotics and canonical vaccination approaches , as well as delaying diagnosis and determination of drug sensitivity .
whereas pandemics appear suddenly , spread rapidly , and raise enormous fears of an impending threat , tb has been spreading slowly but consistently for tens of thousands of years , patiently waiting for new opportunities .
treatment of tb requires a minimum of three drugs administered over at least six months .
the disadvantages of strengthening europe ’s fiscal union further do not end there .
continued progress toward fiscal union would , paradoxically , make political union increasingly unlikely for one simple , but important reason : france .
europe ’s strongest military power by far , france has thwarted all attempts to pool europe ’s armed forces .
in 1954 , france ’s national assembly rejected the treaty for the western union defense organization .
in 2005 , france rejected the proposed european union constitution , which could have marked the beginning of the political unification process .
the limits of inflation targeting are now clear , and the strategy should be discarded .
central banks now have to reconcile the need to maintain price stability with the responsibility – regardless of whether it is legally mandated – to reduce financial vulnerability .
this will not be easy , not least because of another new operational burden that has been placed on many central banks : macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision .
micro-prudential supervision , in particular , implies the risk of political pressure , interference with central banks ’ independence , and policy conflicts , all of which could influence the behavior of financial intermediaries , by encouraging them to assume greater risk .
they know that their supervisor has powerful tools at its disposal – for example , it can lower borrowing costs , thereby protecting banks ( at least for a while ) – and a strong interest in protecting its reputation .
compared to developed countries , an unusually large number of small , unproductive firms coexist with a small number of large , productive firms .
according to standard economic reasoning , this is inefficient .
if the small , unproductive firms closed down and the larger , more productive firms hired their workers , total output and well-being would rise .
this should happen automatically through the invisible hand of competition , because the more productive firms should be able to deliver a better product at a lower price , while luring workers with higher wages .
so , why does n’t this happen routinely in developing countries ?
as china 's new leadership team emerges , the world 's attention has focused on president jiang zemin 's successor .
but this is misguided , for perhaps the most significant moment in china 's recent history of boom and transformation was the 1998 appointment of zhu rongji ( pronounced " joo rong-jee " ) as premier of the state council , a position once held by deng xiaoping .
given the obvious importance of the post in recent years , the choice of mr. zhu 's replacement may be of even more significance than president jiang 's departure from center stage .
even before he became premier , mr. zhu , as the president of china 's central bank , was known as the architect of china 's 8 % annual economic growth in the 1990s and the mastermind of its successful fight against inflation .
mr. zhu has been china 's jack welch , the tough-minded , longtime ceo of the american conglomerate general electric -- a man celebrated for his candor , his global sophistication , and his insistence on performance .
by contrast , trade among african countries accounts for only about 10-12 % of the continent ’s exports and imports .
but , partly because several african countries have escaped the hang-over from the global credit crisis , more investors are focusing on business opportunities there .
by 2050 , the combined gdp of the largest 11 african economies should reach more than $ 13 trillion , surpassing brazil and russia ( but not china or india ) .
for some analysts , the emergence of countries like brazil as economic powerhouses stems partly from successful demutualization of their stock exchanges .
twenty-three bourses are currently operating in africa , and their combined market capitalization has soared from $ 245 billion in 2002 to $ 1 trillion ( 2 % of the world total ) at the end of 2009 – as high as the fifteenth-largest stock exchange in the world .
some countries do suffer when skilled workers emigrate .
but the failure to create mechanisms that allow migrants to use their skills is causing even greater damage .
trained doctors should not be driving taxicabs .
establishing national , regional , and global standards is not easy , but it is absolutely necessary .
• accelerate eligibility for residency rights and citizenship .
heading into the election campaign , fillon may run on a pro-european platform , as evidenced by his pivot during the second-round debates , when he suggested that he favors forming a eurozone government .
unlike trump and the united kingdom ’s “ leave ” campaign , the national front already has a predictable core constituency , amounting to about one-quarter of the electorate .
its coalition of the old french far right and disaffected working-class voters will not arrive unannounced or defy expectations , as happened in the us and the uk .
fillon , for his part , can probably muster the same level of support , and he may even be able to skim votes from le pen , given that around 8 % of primary voters described themselves as national front backers .
what ’s more , political catholicism still appeals to many french voters , and the church itself wants to lure catholics away from the national front and back into its more traditionally conservative fold .
generations of poles have participated in the charity ’s fundraising drives .
for years , poles have ranked owsiak as the country ’s greatest moral authority – ahead of the pope .
the state media ’s narrative portraying owsiak and civic platform as the guilty parties behind adamowicz ’s murder will only undermine the pis .
kaczyński has repeatedly demonstrated his impulsiveness .
he pursues power without considering the consequences of his actions .
new york – the last fast-food hamburger you ate may have cost you next to nothing .
but what did the tomato slice on that burger cost the worker who got it there ?
almost anywhere in the world – including in the united states – the cost can be shockingly high .
appalling wages are just the start .
in florida , tomato pickers earn an average of just $ 0.50 for every 32-pound ( 14.5-kilogram ) bucket .
when xi first unveiled his slogan after being selected as the ccp ’s new general secretary , he defined it in simple , accessible , but nonetheless generic terms : the “ chinese people dream of living the same good life as all other people in the world . ”
xi has said little about the china dream since – and his silence has caused considerable trouble .
china ’s ever-zealous propaganda officials , evidently fearful of not demonstrating sufficient loyalty and respect for the new party chief , quickly hijacked the slogan ; the china dream has replaced the “ china model ” in official political branding .
whatever the new administration does is touted as part of its ambitious effort to make the “ china dream ” come true .
unfortunately , china propagandists , who double as censors , have a perverse ability to discredit anything that they try to brand .
in fact , they can not , for genetic experimentation on humans is impossible .
even in animals whose genes are more easily studied and much better understood , such as drosophila , the tiny fruit fly , there is no simple one-to-one correspondence between gene and behavioral trait .
instead , a wide variety of genes influence each characteristic .
fruit fly genes are surprisingly similar to ours -- as they are to those of most other creatures .
even many aspects of their behavior resemble our own .
gone are the days when strong esg performance was a nice bonus for investors .
pension trustees and fund managers now insist that the companies in which they invest operate in ethical , transparent ways that limit reputational risk .
investment decisions at emerging-market funds are thus increasingly preceded by rigorous esg screenings – screenings that , after 34 years of hun sen ’s dictatorial rule , cambodia has no chance of passing .
cambodia is currently being stripped of its natural resources – including timber , rubber , and sand – for private gain .
environmental degradation – especially deforestation – is accelerating and corruption is running rampant , with cash from opaque sources flowing into cambodia ’s casinos , banks , and real-estate market .
simply put , talk of “ brexit ” has exposed europe ’s economic and political fault lines – and there is no going back .
robert peston , in his 2005 biography of then-chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , described brown ’s “ pragmatic view that the eu was a good thing only insofar as it delivered practical benefits of peace and prosperity to britain . ”
while the british have been particularly open about the nationalist nature of their support for european integration , other eu members have been no less mindful of their domestic interests .
in the wake of world war ii , european countries ’ national interests were aligned .
nonetheless , efforts to establish political unity through a common army failed in 1954 , highlighting that economic common ground was the key to european integration .
quite a few in europe define the eu as an instrument for holding their own against the united states .
they see even the euro as a weapon against the dollar and rejoice when the euro is " strong " and the dollar is " weak " .
the us has found a new " empire of evil " in " terrorist " states and organizations ; europe has found a new adversary who helps it integrate in the united states .
this is a dangerous state of affairs for those on either side of the atlantic who believe in the values of the enlightenment and in the constitution of liberty .
in terms of basic values , there is such a thing as the west .
he is merely kaczyński ’s “ useful idiot ” in an effort to score a political victory over a man who represents the greatest threat the pis faces .
the most saryusz-wolski can realistically hope for is some government position in poland .
perhaps he will replace the widely criticized foreign minister , witold waszczykowski .
the most the pis , for its part , can hope for is that some coalition of countries ( for example , those ruled by social democrats ) will propose another alternative to tusk , whom eu member states will elect in order to avoid escalating the conflict with poland .
in that case , tusk would most likely return to domestic politics , where a ninth victory against the pis would be the punishment kaczyński deserves .
now the eu is again in the irish stew .
but this time it is difficult to see a way out that offers a second referendum .
renegotiating the treaty is out of the question , since doing so would open a pandora ’s box of demands from everybody else .
so the problem lies with the irish , and they must solve it .
i can not help but recall the situation in the summer of 1992 , when a small majority of danish voters rejected the maastricht treaty .
but experiences around the world suggest that this is a risky outlook .
even were banks healthy , the deleveraging process and the associated loss of wealth means that , more likely than not , the economy will be weak .
and a weak economy means , more likely than not , more bank losses .
the problems are not limited to the us .
other countries ( like spain ) have their own real estate crises .
nonetheless , even as it has increased its capacity to provide military forces for un , nato , or eu operations , germany has made clear that it does not view itself as a military power .
german policymakers continue to believe that political and economic means of influence are more effective than violence , implying further development of soft-power tools , including digital diplomacy .
they are also eager to develop more “ networked ” national and european foreign policies that take into account the activities and possible contributions of non-state actors .
for the time being , germany ’s main foreign policy priorities are likely to remain the eu and the continent ’s eastern and southern neighbors – from which immediate security risks are most likely to emanate .
this would be a wise choice .
if greece and other countries are to ensure the health and prosperity of their citizens in the decades to come , they will have to find a way to prevent current economic activity from increasing an already unsustainable burden of environmental debt .
for that to happen , ecological resources must come to be viewed as valuable endowments to be managed wisely .
the mediterranean region ’s unique , breathtaking natural capital is one of its greatest assets – the reason why more than 200 million tourists flock to the region each year , feeding the region ’s economy .
overusing resources , or even failing to manage them carefully , inevitably saps the region ’s economic strength .
of course , countries with ecological deficits can often fill part of the gap through global trade – if they can pay for the necessary imports .
but she must convincingly outline practical strategies to resolve south korea ’s most serious problems , including high unemployment , worsening educational performance , and north korea ’s nuclear weapons program .
ms. park once pledged to provide loans for working-class families from elementary school to college years , while contending that local universities should be empowered to have more autonomy .
she favors engagement policy and the six-party talks so as to resolve the nuclear troubles .
come presidential election-day in 2012 , south korean voters will pick the candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue .
park ’s success will depend , in the end , on the effectiveness of her campaign in further defining her character along those lines .
a fiscal compact like the one approved recently is useful to anchor expectations of future adjustment , but only if the new system is flexible enough to be politically credible .
up-front gradualism must be the name of the game .
and adjustment must be wedded to a growth strategy .
revenue will grow consistently only if the tax base – that is , the economy – grows .
and that growth requires higher public investment in infrastructure and human capital .
second , the international monetary fund , under the g-20 ’s “ mutual assessment process , ” suggested that the united states cut its fiscal deficit by 3 % of gdp more than planned – over $ 400 billion in additional cuts per year .
the imf believes current fiscal plans will deter us economic growth .
recently , the european central bank reiterated its position that serious fiscal consolidation would generate enough increase in private-sector confidence that gains in spending by households and businesses would more than offset lower spending by governments .
the oecd , however , cautions governments not to consolidate too rapidly in a slow global recovery .
america ’s major trading partners want the us to grow and buy more of their exports .
i confess that i view the heritage of communism with more skepticism .
totalitarian pressure did , indeed , form exceptional people such as john paul ii and alexander solzhenitsyn , people for whom religious faith bought freedom from mendacity and solitude .
but it did the same for andrei sakharov and vaclav havel , who defended their supreme values with reference to , and in the language of , lay humanism .
for most people , however , life under totalitarian dictatorship was not ennobling ; it was , rather , a daily immersion in lies , spiritual depravity , and material corruption .
this is why postcommunist societies do not demonstrate any nobility or disinterestedness that seriously contrasts with the west .
the evidence clearly shows that direct policies are much more effective .
the world bank ’s climate focus is also at odds with what the world ’s poorest citizens want .
when the united nations asked almost ten million people around the world to list their priorities , they emphasized better education and health care , less corruption , more jobs , and affordable food .
global warming came last out of 16 issues .
under kim , the bank propagated the simplistic idea that fossil fuels are always damaging , coal must be forbidden , and “ climate aid ” is the solution .
consider the most recent data for the year 2014 from the international energy agency ’s energy statistics 2016 .
the world ’s co2 emissions from energy and industry averaged 4.5 tons per person ( 32.4 billion tons per 7.2 billion people in the iea tabulation ) , while us emissions were nearly four times that level , 16.2 tons per person ( 5.2 billion tons for 320 million people ) .
trump carries on about the paris agreement ’s supposed bias in favor of india , but fails to acknowledge that india ’s per capita emissions are 1.6 tons , just one-tenth of the us level .
trump also bemoans the us contributions to the green climate fund ( and sneers at the name for some reason as well ) .
he complains that the us has already given over $ 1 billion , without explaining to the american people and the world that $ 1 billion is a contribution of $ 3.08 per american .
true , un secretary general ban ki moon can make speeches , convene meetings , and propose actions , but his role is more secretary than general .
sometimes likened to a “ secular pope , ” the un secretary general can wield the soft power of persuasion but little hard economic or military power .
what hard power the un has must be begged and borrowed from the member states .
and when they can not agree on a course of action , it is difficult for the organization to operate .
as one wag has put it , “ we have met the un and it is us ! ”
perhaps for this reason , there has been talk of a meeting in astana between the presidents of russia and france , the us secretary of state , and the presidents of armenia and azerbaijan .
that prospect holds both great opportunity and serious risks .
there is a reason that no such meeting has been held in the 20 years of the conflict .
a meeting of presidents is , after all , the ultimate negotiating forum , and must lead to real , sustainable success .
otherwise , it will appear that no amount of negotiation can help set the caucasus straight – powerfully undermining a key restraint preventing the two sides from trying again to achieve a military solution .
governments in the americas and europe find themselves in rough , uncharted waters .
if the problem were simply a matter of gross violations of the organization of american states ’ democratic charter – convincingly certified by oas secretary general luis almagro – solutions measured in months or years could be considered .
but venezuela is not just a political problem ; it is a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented proportions .
true , venezuela ’s president nicolás maduro is ruling unconstitutionally , relying on emergency decrees and an all-powerful , one-party , illegally established constituent assembly , while ignoring the elected national assembly and banning opposition political parties .
but the impact of his misrule is such that venezuelans are dying from starvation , the health-care system has collapsed , and violence and contagious diseases are now practically out of control .
but the pace at which the political world is embracing social media has accelerated dramatically in the last year .
aside from the bjp ’s wholesale adoption of twitter – modi ’s allies on the network include the party ’s parliamentary leader , sushma swaraj , and a coterie of organized supporters – prominent indian politicians from all parties have leapt in .
a day after he was sworn in as india ’s president , pranab mukherjee announced that he would open a facebook account to receive and respond to the public ’s questions .
chief minister of west bengal mamata banerjee runs a popular and widely read web site that traditional media outlets mine daily .
similarly , omar abdullah , the youthful chief minister of jammu and kashmir , regularly interacts on twitter , and his much older rajasthan and kerala counterparts , ashok gehlot and oommen chandy , respectively , have opened facebook accounts as well .
related to this is the fact that nowadays economic development depends less on a particular country and more on regional integration , which can serve to avoid the negative effects of those financial speculations boosted by globalization .
so the world needs , in its regions , to facilitate integration on the basis of a general economic democratization : currency compatibility , free trade , shared legal rules and most of all a common will to fix the rules of the game according to a region ’s entire interests .
only such equal cooperation can secure the solid political basis for integration .
so long as a country is subordinated to the uncontrollable force of globalization , its future is in foreign hands .
but in agreeing to open regional economies to imports , poor and developing countries must be allowed some means to protect their new industries .
when egyptians rose up against mubarak in january , they were confronted by weapons paid for with borrowed money .
is it fair to expect egyptians to continue paying for their previous repression and impoverishment at the hands of mubarak and his cronies ?
since this money clearly benefited mubarak but not his people , should it not be mubarak , rather than his victims , who is held responsible for it ?
the type of regime mubarak was running had been clear for many years , and it was also clear how the money was being used .
a prudent lender should have considered these facts before making the loans .
perhaps those are ideas en vogue in korea as it thinks about a possible unification , but even there it will be hard to accomplish when the time comes .
claims of alternative strategies must therefore be set at a somewhat lower level – say the initial exchange rate which might have been chosen to make east germany a low wage country .
even that is a dream since , in the face of high unemployment , east german wages increased substantially every year relative to west germany .
at a more depreciated conversion rate we would have simply had a more rapid rate of wage inflation .
one alternative strategy , remotely conceivable , is that west germany would have foreseen the failure of the experiment before embarking upon it .
new businesses in the services sector – 3.6 million of which were started just last year – are generating incremental employment , thanks partly to a new streamlined licensing framework .
and online platforms are facilitating increased consumption , while expanding market access and financing for smaller businesses .
china ’s leaders should aim to accelerate and build upon these trends , rather than pursuing additional fiscal and monetary stimulus .
public investment is high enough ; expanding it now would shift the composition of aggregate demand in the wrong direction .
and , with the corporate sector already overleveraged , a broad-based expansion of credit is not safe .
it would be unimaginable for nato heads of state to go ahead with their planned leadership summit in warsaw in june if poland remains in its constitutional crisis , with the government disregarding the rule of law and the opinion of a respected international body .
hungarians and poles must be reminded that russian president vladimir putin is actively attempting to divide and weaken the eu and nato .
if europe is to face down aggression from the kremlin , it is essential that poland and hungary adhere to these groups ’ fundamental values and principles .
but it is also necessary that the eu itself develop a more comprehensive mechanism for safeguarding the rule of law within the union .
the eu has mechanisms to regulate economic policies , safeguard the environment , and police the single market .
many fear , with good reason , that fossil-fuel interests will exploit solar geoengineering to oppose emissions cuts .
but most researchers are not driven by such interests .
the vast majority of those researching solar geoengineering or advocating for its inclusion in climate-policy debates also support much stronger action to reduce emissions .
still , it ’s very likely that big fossil – from multinational energy companies to coal-dependent regions – will eventually use discussion of geoengineering to fight emissions restrictions .
but that risk is not a sufficient reason to abandon or suppress research on solar geoengineering .
to achieve this , the us would have had to subordinate its power to the goal of shaping the new order , much as it did at the close of world war ii in 1945 .
instead , america succumbed to the temptation of unilateralism .
national greatness for a world power always arises from its ability to shape the world .
if a great power forgets this , or loses the ability to act accordingly , it begins to decline .
it is almost tempting to think that america ’s great cold war opponent , the soviet union , with its sudden disappearance 15 years ago this month , left its own trojan horse for america – the poisoned gift of unilateralism .
the industrialized economies , for their part , must do more to support african oil industries and make sure the negative effects of oil production are mitigated .
for such strategies to work , however , the oil industry must get on board .
this means engaging sincerely with african governments , in order to figure out how best to support national agendas for development and diversification .
the upcoming abu dhabi international petroleum exhibition and conference , hosted by the abu dhabi national oil company – which will be attended by barkindo , as well as numerous african energy ministers and oil-industry leaders – is an ideal opportunity to initiate such a process .
working with other stakeholders , campaigners for a sustainable and just transition can also achieve something more : allowing carbon energy to have a positive impact on economies which have so far experienced only the negative effects of the oil-backed development of the twentieth century .
economic development in the gaza strip was limited under egyptian rule , and the region suffered the burden of absorbing palestinian refugees fleeing the fighting in the southern part of mandatory palestine , which would later become israel .
palestinians ’ access to egypt was restricted , and much of gaza ’s largely unskilled workforce was dependent on the un relief works administration , which built and maintained the local refugee camps .
the 1967 war placed all of mandatory palestine ( as well as sinai and the golan ) under israeli military occupation .
nevertheless , although one-third of the west bank was closed to palestinians to make room for a few thousand jewish settlers , only 10 % of its largely rural population were refugees , many owned their land , and a variety of jobs was available .
by contrast , 70 % of the gaza population comprised refugees , who lived in difficult conditions in scores of refugee camps and were largely dependent on work in israel .
the second draft of history is often written by the key people themselves .
after world war ii , winston churchill confidently asserted that history would treat him kindly because “ i propose to write that history . ”
when the financial crisis erupted , the same thought may have crossed the minds of hank paulson , ben bernanke , and tim geithner , who were us treasury secretary , chairman of the federal reserve bank , and president of the new york fed , respectively .
all three published lengthy memoirs explaining why they did , and did n’t , do what they did and did n’t do – inevitably , with a degree of self-justification in each case .
now , a decade later , the three of them have co-authored what might be described as version 2.1 of that episode ’s history .
the aim was not to tackle the problems they faced directly , but to induce new , more efficient activities that would help to turn debt into assets and maximize use of the economy ’s capacity .
in this sense , east asia ’s economies have embraced the process of “ creative destruction ” described by the austrian economist joseph schumpeter , whereby the economic structure is continually revolutionized from within .
moreover , by implementing incremental reforms that facilitate – and even encourage – the replacement of old , inefficient sources of growth with new , more dynamic ones , they have expedited this process .
for example , china ’s productivity-enhancing agricultural reforms in the 1980s were spurred partly by growth in the non-agricultural sector , a result of policies aimed at stimulating township and village enterprises .
similarly , in the 1990s , china addressed the buildup of bad debt and unfinished construction projects – the result of state-owned enterprises ’ chronic loss-making and excessive property investment , respectively – by implementing institutional reforms that stimulated growth in more dynamic sectors , thereby offsetting the soes ’ declining return on capital .
brussels – as protests over china ’s crackdown in tibet and the debate about kosovo ’s unilateral declaration of independence continue to fester , the injustice of taiwan ’s ongoing international isolation has barely stirred a flicker of interest , despite taiwan ’s recent presidential election and referendum on united nations membership .
this neglect is not only shortsighted , but may also prove dangerous .
this seeming double standard can be explained partly by a sense of guilt : the west has , for the most part , embraced kosovo ’s independence in an effort to assuage its own culpability for not preventing slobodan milosevic ’s campaign of ethnic cleansing there .
similarly , much of the world is protesting on behalf of tibet because countless millions have witnessed china ’s brutal suppression of tibetan culture .
taiwan , on the other hand , does not grab our attention , because it is stable and flourishing economically .
many are now eagerly offering their views as to whether the uk should look again at the “ norway model ” of relations with the eu , or some other scheme that maintains uk participation in the single market .
whatever the option , it is now clear that britain needs a policy that can command broad and genuine support .
a second change for the better would , i hope , be less controversial : reducing the power bestowed in the uk on non-elected special advisers , or spads , who have become dominant figures in all government departments .
during my 17-month experience as a minister , i became convinced that the spads ’ excessive power – and haughty approach – undermines the uk ’s excellent civil service , as well as elected and appointed ministers .
may ’s two leading spads , fiona hill and nick timothy , took this danger to worrying levels .
indeed , many of the ingredients used to make nanomaterials are currently known to present risks to human health .
an encouraging trend is that the methods used to produce nanomaterials often become “ greener ” as they move from the laboratory to industrial production .
setting aside the issue of nanomaterials ’ toxicity , preliminary results suggest that fabricating nanomaterials entails risks that are less than or comparable to those associated with many current industrial activities .
it would be naïve to imagine that nanotechnology will evolve without risks to our health and environment .
while attempting to halt the development of nanomaterial-inspired technologies would be as irresponsible as it is unrealistic , responsible development of these technologies demands vigilance and social commitment .
globally , human trafficking generates average annual profits of $ 150 billion , of which two-thirds ( $ 99 billion ) come from forced sexual exploitation .
with the rapid growth of digital platforms threatening to make child sex trafficking even more lucrative , the world must take urgent , coordinated action to combat this appalling crime .
today , almost 4.5 billion people have access to the internet , and around one in three internet users is under the age of 18 .
the unregulated online world is therefore fertile ground for reaping enormous profits from child sex trafficking .
would-be traffickers need only a laptop or a smartphone with a high-speed internet connection to go into business .
we all owe them for that .
the euro has experienced a hard but promising start .
it should not come as a surprise that the euro started to slide against the dollar , considering the differences in economic performance between america and europe .
and it should not come as a surprise that the markets have tested the willingness of european political leaders to keep quiet where monetary affairs are concerned .
recent intervention and support from america and japan showed that the euro is here to stay and that the markets believe in its success .
people had learned that it pays to buy the dips , and were not weaned from the habit until it ceased to pay .
now that internet fever has abated , we hear that the “ fundamentals ” are reasserting themselves .
but this view is as much a half-truth as the previous notion that the boom would last forever because the internet economy had created new fundamentals .
indeed , the internet boom/bust cycle brings into question prevailing economic theories about financial markets .
what should now be clear is that the so-called fundamentals that supposedly determine stock prices are not independently given .
palo alto – since the development of the science of toxicology in the sixteenth century , its guiding principle has been that “ the dose makes the poison . ”
it is a rule that applies to the medicines used by patients worldwide many billions of times a day .
the right dose of aspirin can be a therapeutic godsend , but consuming too much can be lethal .
the principle even applies to foods : large amounts of nutmeg or licorice are notoriously toxic .
the risk that a substance poses broadly depends on two factors : its inherent capacity to cause harm and one ’s exposure to it .
given libya ’s lack of democratic experience , some view this as a likely outcome in the post-qaddafi era .
but libya is not the only country that has tried to move from dictatorship to democracy with weak institutions and strong tribal identities .
albania , mongolia , and india successfully passed more complicated tests – and offer some useful lessons in democratic transitions under unfavourable conditions .
the fourth scenario is partition , with the old three-province , ottoman-style setup commonly mentioned : cyrenaica ( east ) , fezzan ( south ) , and tripolitania ( west ) .
cyrenaica is qaddafi-free , tripolitania is not , and fezzan did not fully join the revolution .
they propose tax cuts equal to 5 % of gdp for 3-4 years in all eurozone countries , financed by very long-term public debt , all of which the ecb should buy .
they argue that ecb quantitative easing alone , with no fiscal relaxation , would be ineffective .
giavazzi and tabellini ’s proposals may entail too large a stimulus .
but they also highlight a crucial question : how does quantitative easing stimulate an economy ?
the bank of england has presented qe as a purely monetary policy tool that sustains economic growth in the face of necessary and desirable fiscal consolidation .
never mind that the eye-popping growth projections in representative paul ryan ’s budget plan , for example , are utterly implausible ; these projections matter politically , because , without them , the full sting of ryan ’s proposed medicare cuts would be readily apparent .
standard & poor ’s has received some justified criticism for the analysis behind its recent decision to downgrade us government debt ; after all , there was little economic news that could explain the move ’s timing .
but s & p ’s assessment of the political situation is on target : by creating a dysfunctional paralysis at the heart of government , the tea party has shown that it is willing to impose dramatic costs on the broader economy and to ensure significantly slower growth .
confrontation and brinkmanship have become the new watchwords of american politics , even when the us government ’s legal ability to pay its debts is on the line , owing to the tea party ’s ideological rigidity .
and the tone of political debate , not surprisingly , has become much nastier .
trump , for his part , accepted xi ’s invitation to visit china soon .
on trade , trump and xi agreed to a 100-day plan for discussions on reducing the us trade deficit with china .
moreover , the us accepted china ’s proposal to revamp the framework for bilateral engagement by creating the us-china comprehensive dialogue , consisting of four sub-dialogues : diplomacy and security , economic issues , law enforcement and cybersecurity , and social and cultural affairs .
the understanding between xi and trump reflected a sober acknowledgement of the domestic and international risks their countries face .
both seemed to recognize that a stable us-china relationship is necessary to enable them to focus on their respective challenges .
the uae and qatar have already instituted compulsory military service for adult males .
and kuwait is considering following in jordan ’s footsteps by reintroducing conscription , which is already in place in most sunni states ( and iran ) .
against this background , efforts to tame the deep-seated sunni-shia rivalry ( by , for example , improving relations between saudi arabia and iran ) , though undoubtedly important , should not take priority over a strategy to address the sectarianism plaguing the sunni belt .
that strategy must center on federalism .
had federalism been introduced in somalia , for example , when the north-south rift emerged , it probably would not have ended up as a failed state .
the left failed to recognize that israeli elections are not strictly political affairs ; they are an expression of an ongoing kulturkampf in an ethnically kaleidoscopic society .
israeli elections are in some ways a tribal affair ; people vote on the basis of memories , insults , religious sensibilities , and group grievances .
the israeli right ’s current political dominance is fed by a widespread yearning for jewish roots , a deep-seated fear of arabs , and an uncompromising mistrust of a “ world , ” the so-called international community , with which jews have a centuries-old dispute .
the left ’s yearning for peace is seen as naive , if not an exercise in political lunacy ( and in either case an unpardonable betrayal of jewish identity ) .
netanyahu positioned himself as a magnet for the fears and complexes of a broad array of aggrieved voters , including russian immigrants , orthodox jews , most traditionalist israelis , and religious settlers .
furthermore , among the new jobs that will be created will be many in fields like education and health care , where women have traditionally thrived .
according to mgi research , more than 100 million jobs could be created over the next 10-15 years as health care and education needs grow .
it is not yet clear exactly how automation will affect women ’s employment .
but there is no doubt that protecting – and even enhancing – women ’s job and income prospects will require upgrading their skills , so that they can take advantage of the new and changing opportunities created by the ongoing digital revolution .
the success of women in e-commerce attests to the power of digital technologies to level the economic playing field , to the benefit of individual women , their communities and societies , and the world economy .
russia conquered muslim territories in the volga-ural area , caucasus and central asia , and brutally suppressed any resistance .
however , after loyalty was secured , the government adopted a more pragmatic policy .
until the mid 19th century , sedentary muslim elites were co-opted into the imperial aristocracy , just as , in the 20th century , national communist elites were absorbed into the soviet nomenclatura .
indeed , russia 's contacts with the muslim world go back thousands of years and were rooted in a tradition of tolerance .
with a few short-lived exceptions , russia 's imperial government did not support orthodox evangelism .
hong kong has experienced an unprecedented 17 weeks of mostly peaceful demonstrations ( occasional episodes of violence have attracted disproportionate media attention ) .
the trigger was a proposed extradition law that many feared would extend the mainland ’s reach into hong kong ’s judicial system .
the absence of any plan to bring together various protest groups and the hong kong government has become a source of growing concern .
such a plan would need to do at least two things .
first , all parties ( including china ’s central government in this case ) , need to recommit to the “ one country , two systems ” framework .
to address this distortion head on , and to provide clarity concerning the allocation of funds , the egf should focus its limited funds on two simple active labor market programs : wage insurance and mobility allowance .
wage insurance could offer workers whose pay was cut after displacement compensation for up to two years amounting to half the difference between the old and the new wage .
the mobility allowance could offer those moving for a new job a lump-sum payment of two months ’ gross pay in the previous job , or four months ’ pay for cross-border moves .
the very simplicity of this scheme will likely ensure high visibility and reasonable take-up rates .
the downside of such a focused approach is also clear : the margin of choice for eu members about how egf funds are to be spent in their country would be minimal .
asia ’s share was 28 % ( after including japan ) .
but kharas ’s projections suggest that asia will account for two-thirds of the world ’s middle class by 2030 .
in other words , asia will displace not just the west , but even other emerging regions .
this is the real business opportunity .
of course , the rise of asia ’s middle class is not the only change we should expect .
populist parties , both on the far right and the far left , are gaining electoral traction .
some , such as france ’s national front , oppose their country ’s eurozone membership ; others , such as podemos in spain , do not .
nonetheless , the challenge that these new parties pose to europe could prove to be extremely disruptive .
a greek exit from the eurozone , together with financial and political turmoil inside greece , would be perceived as a major defeat for european integration – especially after the laborious efforts made to hold together the monetary union and , with it , the european dream .
such an outcome would be even more disheartening in light of the tragic terrorist attacks in paris , and after unity marches in france and across the continent rekindled a long-fading sense of european solidarity .
taken together , all these shortcomings cast serious doubt on the eu ’s claim to be leading the debate over a fundamental reshaping of global economic governance .
european governments repeat the mantra of “ effective multilateralism , ” but they seem to have no comprehensive strategy for translating this into coherent policy .
indeed , when europeans think about reforming global governance , they limit themselves to numbers of seats and voting weights in international bodies .
european governments are only now reluctantly accepting the need to scale back their over-representation in multilateral bodies , recognizing that it undermines rather than enhances the eu ’s overall influence by pushing other powers into separate arrangements .
but , while deliberation is taking place on how much europe should retreat from its historical domination of multilateral bodies , there is little vision beyond this .
são paulo – a decades-old legal fight between consumers and financial institutions over the impact of brazil ’s economic policies of the 1980s and 1990s is nearing conclusion .
in december , lawyers representing claimants presented brazil ’s supreme federal court with a request to ratify a settlement reached with the banks .
if the court approves the deal , the settlement would put billions of reals into the pockets of savers .
but more than a long-awaited payday for some one million claimants , the court-ordered restitution would also mark an official end to brazil ’s seemingly endless war on hyperinflation .
during the late 1980s and early 1990s , the brazilian government struggled to stabilize the country ’s economy and currency .
today , women dominate african agriculture , the continent ’s most important industry .
but this has not translated into greater control of finances .
one measure of this deficiency is rates of borrowing ; in east africa , where my organization works , women borrow 13 % less money for farm-related activities than men do .
illiteracy , limited land ownership , and restrictions on agency and mobility all conspire to reduce rural women ’s access to farm financing .
these barriers have had a dramatic impact on social and economic progress .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
the modi government ’s supporters tout a slew of new repressive legislation – including the criminalization of talaq-e-biddat , the muslim practice of “ instant divorce ” – as a display of resoluteness .
liquidity injections and low interest rates have a microeconomic effect that has received little attention : they lower the cost of capital vis-à-vis the cost of labor , which causes a relative decline in demand for labor .
this is very likely exacerbating the unemployment problem ; it certainly is not mitigating it .
one solution is to channel part of the liquidity injections toward countering this factor-cost asymmetry .
thus , for every $ 100 of new liquidity , we could use $ 60 to purchase assets and the remainder to give firms a marginal job-creation subsidy , which could be especially effective in economies with flexible labor markets that enable short-term hiring .
even if the employment subsidy were offered only for , say , one year , firms would be tempted to use more labor during this time .
what is clear is that the experience of countries that have implemented the treaty has not been particularly positive , unless those countries have a high tolerance for bureaucratic regulatory regimes that stifle innovation and development in the name of lofty aspirations .
the seed treaty is cut from the same anti-capitalist , anti-science , anti-innovation cloth as the convention on biological diversity ( cbd ) .
it also mirrors the flagrantly unscientific , anti-genetic-engineering cartagena protocol on biosafety to the cbd .
and it has much in common with the nagoya-kuala lumpur supplementary protocol on liability and redress to the cartagena protocol – yet another anti-genetic-engineering screed , which accomplishes little except to frighten potential entrepreneurs away from agricultural biotechnology .
it is overwrought , confusing , and complex – in short , inimical to innovations that could benefit the world ’s poor .
" there is , " he wrote in an echo of today 's globalization debates , " a certain situation of capitalistically disorganized economies , in which the higher culture is not victorious but rather loses in the existential fight with lower cultures . "
in the center - beleaguered by the anti-global reactions of left and right - a liberal commercial elite saw the products of economic opening or globalization as wholly beneficial .
instead of a two part split between left and right , there was thus a triple division , between anti-globalization conservatives , pro-globalization liberals , and re-distributionist leftists .
when the extremes of the political spectrum became radicalized , as they did in the interwar period - the anti-international right moved to fascism , the left to communism - democratic politics became paralyzed .
for much of the post-1945 period , these divisions disappeared as right and left fought battles for redistribution within national economies .
the chinese leadership ’s penchant for secretiveness is proverbial .
but the veil that exists over how that omnipotent party makes important decisions is being lifted somewhat because a volume of unique materials about the behind-the-scenes events surrounding the infamous tiananmen massacre of 1989 is being published this month .
the materials contained in that book , which i brought out of china and decided to make public , consist of hundreds of documents , including minutes and transcripts of meetings at which the most important leaders of the people ’s republic deliberated on how to handle the tienanmen demonstrations ; key speeches ; notes on crucial telephone conversations between leaders ; classified reports from security agencies ; and dispatches from the police and military .
taken as a whole , these documents provide a rare glimpse into the modus operandi of china ’s leaders .
as a witness and participant in the tiananmen events , and as someone with access to the historical archive , i felt it my duty to publish this record of the decisions that lay behind what happened .
in the 1970s , for example , czechoslovakia , like other communist states , was a dreary , oppressive , joyless place , where mediocre party hacks set the tone , and creativity was stifled under a blanket of enforced conformism .
rock and roll was considered a noxious form of capitalist decadence .
a local rock band named plastic people of the universe , performing in english , was arrested in the late 1970s for “ organized disturbance of the peace . ”
recordings by the rolling stones and other western groups were banned .
and yet records were smuggled into czechoslovakia and other eastern european countries , where they were treasured by young rock fans , including the dissident playwright václav havel , who would later become the country ’s president .
the debt-ceiling absolutists grossly underestimate the massive adjustment costs of a self-imposed “ sudden stop ” in debt finance .
such costs are precisely why impecunious countries such as greece face massive social and economic displacement when financial markets lose confidence and capital flows suddenly dry up .
of course , there is an appealing logic to saying that governments should have to balance their budgets just like the rest of us ; unfortunately , it is not so simple .
governments typically have myriad ongoing expenditure commitments related to basic services such as national defense , infrastructure projects , education , and health care , not to mention to retirees .
no government can just walk away from these responsibilities overnight .
ironically , this perception brings israel some rather unlikely partners .
president hosni mubarak of egypt claims that shiites are “ always loyal to iran , " while king abdullah of jordan has coined the axiom about a rising “ shiite crescent . ”
this “ rise of the shiites ” and the resulting “ sunni/shia divide ” is alleged to be creating an ever widening chasm in the region .
although this perception may convince at first glance , it is ultimately based on generalizations that reveal more about its advocates than the actual reality on the ground .
take iraq , where the looming “ shia crescent ” is often blamed for much of the chaos .
worse , the consultancy wood mackenzie finds that the renewables boom has translated into only 2 % of global energy demand .
as matters stand , coal , oil , and gas could still supply 85 % of primary energy by 2040 , down only slightly from 90 % today .
to complete the transition away from fossil fuels will require drilling down to the core of the global economy .
it does not help that financial institutions in china funneled at least $ 1 billion in “ green ” financing to coal-related projects in the first half of this year .
companies can not keep producing oil , gas , and internal combustion engines while gradually shifting to cleaner technologies ; they need to make a clean break .
furthermore , with us support , colombia ’s armed forces have become stronger , owing to modernization of military equipment and doctrine , an increase in the number of soldiers , and improved training .
as a result , armed conflict is becoming increasingly costly for the rebels .
indeed , unlike in 2002 , when the farc could make impossible demands on the government , today ’s environment favors the state , forcing the rebels to keep their demands realistic .
the farc is unlikely to stage a media spectacle at the meetings in norway and cuba .
the agenda will focus on ending the conflict , without endless discussion of theoretical or doctrinaire questions .
yes , this is a volatile data series , because it rises and falls with the usual course of events .
but it is also another area where obama set the bar high during his two terms .
the most positive thing that can be said about trump ’s first year of economic policymaking is that he did not deliver on his campaign promise to disrupt trade .
the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) remains intact , as do trade relations with china and other major us partners .
the administration did impose tariffs in january on solar panels and washing machines , but those are small relative to the size of the economy .
all these books are variations of the protocols of the elders of zion , the russian forgery first published in 1903 , which japanese came across after defeating the czar ’s army in 1905 .
the chinese picked up many modern western ideas from the japanese .
perhaps this is how jewish conspiracy theories were passed on as well .
but southeast asians are not immune to this kind of nonsense either .
the former prime minister of malaysia , mahathir bin mohammed , has said that “ the jews rule the world by proxy .
it needs not just closer economic ties , but also closer political ties .
those running a strong emergency financing mechanism will have to be strongly accountable .
they will have to answer to a strong european parliament .
german chancellor angela merkel ’s constituents hate bailouts , because they know that it is they who will be doing the bailing .
they oppose anything that smacks of european political integration .
new york – striving to revive the world economy while simultaneously responding to the global climate crisis has raised a knotty question : are statistics giving us the right “ signals ” about what to do ?
in our performance-oriented world , measurement issues have taken on increased importance : what we measure affects what we do .
if we have poor measures , what we strive to do ( say , increase gdp ) may actually contribute to a worsening of living standards .
we may also be confronted with false choices , seeing trade-offs between output and environmental protection that do n’t exist .
by contrast , a better measure of economic performance might show that steps taken to improve the environment are good for the economy .
bangkok – a friend recently asked a seemingly naïve question : “ what is money ?
how do i know i can trust that it is worth what it says it is worth ? ”
we learn in introductory economics that money is a medium of exchange .
but why do we accept that ?
banknotes are just pieces of paper with a number attached to them .
of course , the idea of abolishing borders within europe holds great symbolic importance and appeal .
but sometimes even sacred cows need to be slaughtered .
with the refugee crisis turning schengen into a threat to the credibility of the eu as a collective entity and of its national governments ’ ability to maintain order and the rule of law , that time is now .
when it was first created in 1985 , the schengen area included just five countries ( belgium , france , luxembourg , the netherlands , and west germany ) .
membership has since ballooned to include 22 of the eu ’s 28 member countries – with four of those left out ( bulgaria , croatia , cyprus , and romania ) due to join in the future – plus four non-eu members ( norway , iceland , switzerland , and liechtenstein ) .
no doubt , putin is now likely to behave like a peacemaker .
he is not interested in reinforcing the power of his kremlin aides .
he also realizes that big business is crucially important for russia 's modernization .
he simply wants the oligarchs to stick to their sphere of activity and to leave politics to him .
but the problem wo n't go away .
the danger now is that political uncertainty in germany , france , italy , and the uk will create an opening for populists and self-declared “ illiberal ” democrats such as hungarian prime minister viktor orbán to build more walls ( physically as well as metaphorically ) and mobilize the ghosts of nationalism .
moreover , europe ’s external environment has become more dangerous .
though the world ’s attention is currently fixed on the risks of an escalating sino-american trade war , the threat of an equally destructive transatlantic conflict can not be ignored .
trump seems genuinely to believe that german cars on the streets of new york pose a threat to us national security .
should he wake up one morning and decide to impose heavy import tariffs on european cars , things could get very ugly , very fast .
there is a trade-off between competition and stability .
indeed , greater competitive pressure may increase the fragility of banks ’ balance sheets and make investors more prone to panics .
it may also erode the charter value of institutions .
a bank with thin margins and limited liability does not have much to lose , and will tend to gamble – a tendency that is exacerbated by deposit insurance and too-big-to-fail policies .
the result will be more incentives to assume risk .
vaccines have already eradicated smallpox , and dramatically reduced child deaths and disease associated with measles , diphtheria , and tetanus .
yet , sadly , a child still dies every 20 seconds from diseases like pneumonia , which can be prevented by a vaccine .
most of them live in poor and remote communities that still lack access to the basic vaccines that are universally available in better-off countries .
this is one of the reasons why a child born in a high-income country is 18 times less likely than a child born in a low-income country to die before reaching the age of five .
fortunately , the world is taking action .
as the pioneering child psychologist jean piaget showed , children in the early stages of development go through a phase of egocentrism : they naturally focus on their own needs , and they do n’t think about the rules .
a child might snatch another child ’s toy , break it , and then deny having done so .
rather than admit to breaking the rules , they lie to reconcile the inconsistency .
to the child ’s mind , he is not in the wrong ; the world is simply misinformed .
and because the child believes that everyone operates under his particular definitions of right and wrong , he can not comprehend that someone else might see things differently .
it is this difference , more than anything else , that sets the two economies apart .
what can india do to close the gap ?
its biggest shortcoming is its lack of roads , bridges , ports , and other infrastructure , where the contrast with china is just stunning .
if your products ca n’t get to the global economy , you can not conquer it .
over the past five years , china has multiplied its highway system five-fold .
critical thought is increasingly dismissed as an elitist endeavor , while unaccountable social media , “ fake news , ” and “ alternative facts ” dominate public discussion .
in an environment of ignorance , populist politicians make willing prey of those who feel ignored .
but because those politicians are so appealing to so many , they , no less than easily swayed voters , must be scrutinized .
the question is whether a brand of politics that threatens liberal democracy can also be reformulated to save it .
there are two types of populists today : the exploitative and the enlightened .
the last feature that stands out in this period of historically slow productivity growth is weak demand .
we know from corporate decision-makers that demand is crucial for investment .
for example , an mgi survey conducted last year found that 47 % of companies increasing their investment budgets were doing so because of an increase in demand or demand expectations .
across industries , the slow recovery in demand following the financial crisis was a key factor holding back investment .
the crisis increased uncertainty about the future direction in consumer and investment demand .
here is a country that has long cherished its “ exception ” from the normal rules of market economics , a foggy view that rejects both central planning and free markets and claims to offer a well-balanced middle ground .
the french do not care that they have never been able to articulate their vision of a “ third way , ” for they remain deeply convinced that the state has a key role to play in steering markets in order to defend “ higher ” values from the single-minded pursuit of materialism .
this view , propagated since world war ii by a quasi-marxist intelligentsia , is so ingrained that the french do not even bother to understand how markets operate .
they look upon economics as an ideological battleground , where all views can be entertained without being confronted with logic , much less with facts .
yet facts have been hitting hard .
health care and social security already consume half of the us federal budget , up from one-sixth in 1965 , and these outlays relative to gdp are projected to more than double by 2040 .
with no change in course , the programs ’ “ trust fund ” balances will be depleted by the 2030s .
avoiding that outcome will require us political leaders to constrain the growth of entitlement spending and bolster support for middle-income individuals .
while social security and medicare remain important to ensure wellbeing in retirement , their role must be updated to suit today ’s needs .
for example , to ensure that no one who has worked for 30 or more years will live in poverty in old age , social security needs a higher minimum benefit for lower-income workers , with more affluent seniors seeing less growth in benefits over time .
new york -- president george w. bush rightly called pakistan ’s recent national and provincial elections “ a victory for [ its ] people . ”
but , even as he uttered those words , his administration was working behind the scenes to subvert the will of pakistan ’s people by trying to dictate the composition of their next coalition government and prop up the election ’s biggest loser , president pervez musharraf .
bush is playing a dangerous game , risking the collapse of pakistan ’s political process for the sake of his own legacy .
millions of pakistanis delivered a clear message at the polls .
collectively , they voted against musharraf and religious extremists , and in favor of democracy , the rule of law , and good governance .
three of five hiv-positive people still are not receiving antiretroviral therapy .
moreover , long-term treatment is not the same as a cure , and no public-health tool ( apart from clean drinking water ) has ever matched the preventive power of a vaccine .
hiv is an extremely complex virus .
it mutates rapidly within an individual and among geographic locations , establishing latent reservoirs within cells that enable it to emerge and replicate months or even years later .
it evades the immune system , so the body ’s natural ability to fight or clear it is limited .
according to this argument , academic scientists should either publish their research openly or leave the university before pursuing commercial interests .
similarly , the universities that employ them should leave product development to existing companies .
but it is useful to recall that the university has been accused of subverting its own ideals and social role since time immemorial , yet what in the past initially looked to many like a conflict of interest often later came to be viewed as a confluence of purposes .
for example , during the late 19 th century , as us universities began to place research at the heart of the academic mission , they were accused of forsaking their traditional pedagogical role .
many professors argued that the demands of research would render their teaching obligations impossible to fulfill .
brussels – throughout the crisis period , the european central bank ’s behavior has been conditioned by the tension between what it can do and what it is allowed to do .
the ecb is the only institution in the european union that is able to provide unlimited funding to governments , but its governing statute prohibits government bailouts .
nonetheless , the ecb has provided large amounts of liquidity to the financial system , indirectly softening the pressure on government debt refinancing .
for 18 months , it has been buying government bonds – worth more than € 200 billion ( $ 254 billion ) – on secondary markets under its securities market program .
moreover , it has provided loans to the banking sector , recently launching a three-year refinancing operation that generated demand from eurozone banks for € 489 billion .
america would be facing these problems even if it were not simultaneously facing a financial crisis .
america ’s economy had been supercharged by excessive leveraging ; now comes the painful process of deleveraging .
excessive leveraging , combined with bad lending and risky derivatives , has caused credit markets to freeze .
after all , when banks do n’t know their own balance sheets , they are n’t about to trust others ’ . ampnbsp ;
the bush administration did n’t see the problems coming , denied that they were problems when they came , then minimized their significance , and , finally , panicked .
vietnam and south korea offer inspiring examples of countries that transformed their education systems within a generation .
as former south korean education minister and commission member lee ju-ho noted during our visit , teaching young people to think critically takes time , but the results can have powerful knock-on effects for a country ’s knowledge economy .
aware of these benefits , myanmar has put education at the heart of its reform agenda .
one priority – to improve inclusivity – is already underway .
for example , the government is currently working to encourage instruction in more local languages – more than 100 are spoken in myanmar – in rural areas .
but what if the compensation assumed by economists in theory does not happen in practice ?
what if market-fundamentalist politics specifically prohibits the income redistribution or regional , industrial , and education subsidies that could compensate those who suffer from free trade and labor-market “ flexibility ” ?
in that case , pareto optimality is not socially optimal at all .
instead , policies that intensify competition , whether in trade , labor markets , or domestic production , may be socially destructive and politically explosive .
this highlights yet another reason for the failure of economic policy since 2007 .
madrid – economic globalization , together with a rebalancing of power between the world ’s north and south , has made developing countries , and many companies within them , key global economic actors .
this provides a new rationale for strengthening the international framework to protect foreign investment .
once upon a time , global foreign direct investment flowed from only a few sources : the traditionally wealthy states of europe , north america , and japan .
but cross-border investment from countries such as brazil , india , and china is now flowing not just to other emerging and transitional economies , but also to the “ old ” fdi-exporting states .
these changes have increased the complexity of the international investment regime , and should broaden interest in developing a more effective investment-protection framework .
worries about globalization and the computer revolution ultimately boil down to the same thing , because globalization is mostly a consequence of new information technology .
computers and the internet made it possible to send information almost costlessly , and to do business across cultures and continents .
the worry is that information technology is now on the bend of a " hockey stick " curve , where it will suddenly take off at much greater speed than before .
the resulting changes will not all be welcome in economic terms .
hockey stick curves often occur in nature .
copenhagen – amid a growing wave of concern about climate change , many countries – including brazil , australia , the united states , and the members of the european union – passed laws in the 2000 ’s outlawing or severely restricting access to incandescent light bulbs .
the intention was understandable : if everyone in the world exchanged most light bulbs for energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs ( cfls ) , we could save 3.5 % of all electricity , or 1 % of our co2 emissions .
the current attempt by republicans in the us congress to roll back america ’s effort to ban incandescent bulbs has revived this discussion .
many contend that the agenda is being driven by knuckle-dragging climate-change deniers .
but it ’s worth taking a closer look at the premise that banning things is the smartest way to tackle global warming .
this approach limits gains from trade .
for example , the inter-american development bank reports that the trade gains from latin america ’s 33 small regional trade agreements have been meager .
the key to boosting those gains , according to the iadb , is to adopt a new strategy that expands access across and within markets .
this suggests that , for the uk , mega-regional trade agreements – which provide access to multiple markets , but entail lower levels of fiscal and regulatory integration than the eu – are the best way forward .
after all , it is this approach that would enable uk firms to position themselves in well-developed and integrated supply chains , serving much larger markets than those to which a bilateral agreement would grant them access .
growth patterns that systematically exclude subgroups founder on the loss of political and social cohesion and , ultimately , on the loss of support for the strategy .
by contrast , income inequality that is not too extreme , and that does not arise from corruption or privileged access to markets , is understood and accepted .
the provision of high-quality basic services like education and health care is viewed as crucial for equality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility .
against that backdrop , one can assess current growth patterns in the global economy and its various parts .
for starters , public-sector investment is broadly below levels needed to restore and sustain growth , partly owing to fiscal constraints in overly indebted countries .
for starters , it is important to recognize that the line needs to be clearly visible before extremist parties even arise .
if the rule of law is to be upheld , democratic self-defense must not appear ad hoc or arbitrary .
thus the criteria for bans should be spelled out in advance .
one criterion that seems universally accepted is a party ’s use , encouragement , or at least condoning of violence – as was evidently the case with golden dawn ’s role in attacks on immigrants in athens .
there is less consensus about parties that incite hatred and are committed to destroying core democratic principles – especially because many extremist parties in europe go out of their way to emphasize that they are not against democracy ; on the contrary , they are fighting for “ the people . ”
for them , patriotism means being harder-headed about protecting the national interest and adopting more democratic policies that help the working masses , not jet-setting fat cats .
the second part of this argument – that the interests of ordinary people have been subordinated to those of the elite – must be heard and responded to .
a democracy in which a majority feels neglected or exploited is not sustainable .
either the government or the entire system will be overturned .
elected officials clearly need to find answers to high unemployment and declining living standards .
more important , wealth and consumption in china are closely related to real-estate values , not equity values .
finally , the renminbi ’s recent decline against the dollar was only 2.5 % , from cn ¥ 6.2 to cn ¥ 6.35 – far below the double-digit declines of the japanese yen , the euro , and the british pound .
so , on an overall trade-weighted basis , the renminbi is substantially higher relative to the currencies with which it competes .
even more relevant , the decline of the renminbi and other currencies in the past year has had very little impact on us import prices , because chinese and other exporters price their goods in dollars and do not adjust them when the exchange rate changes .
while official us data show overall import prices down 11 % in the 12 months through august , this is almost entirely due to lower energy costs .
many developing countries spend a lot of time in a stable , no-growth equilibrium , and then shift to a more positive one .
there is nothing automatic about that .
in all of the cases with which i am familiar , effective leadership was the catalyst .
so , while we can expect a multi-year process of rebalancing and closing the gap between actual and potential growth , exactly how long it will take depends on policy choices and the speed of structural adjustment .
in southern europe , for example , the process will take longer , because there are more missing components of recovery in these countries .
finally , the eu should work to francoize belarus .
like spain in the dictator ’s final years , a political opening is unlikely .
but the belarusian economic model can not survive , with the trade deficit forecast to exceed $ 7 billion ( 14 % of gdp ) this year .
belarus can not borrow enough to cover this .
as with spain under franco , belarus ’s economy will change before lukashenka does , laying the basis for rapid development once he is gone .
these countries have extremely diverse economic and social conditions , and very different levels of wealth .
for example , south koreans now enjoy a standard of living similar to that in the european union , which makes many analysts ’ persistent categorization of south korea as an “ emerging economy ” all the more baffling .
meanwhile , mexico ’s and turkey ’s levels of wealth have n’t come anywhere near that of south korea , and yet they are considerably wealthier than the rest of the n-11 , some of which remain among the poorest countries in the world .
at the same time , asian n-11 countries such as the philippines and vietnam have grown significantly since 2005 , while mexico ’s performance has been somewhat disappointing , and egypt ’s even more so .
collectively , the n-11 comprises some 1.5 billion people , and its current nominal gdp is around $ 6.5 trillion .
for the first time since world war ii , europe finds itself without a notable ally or partner .
far from an aberration , trump ’s trade wars and betrayal of allies represent a new norm for the world order .
multilateralism , human rights , and respect for international law are now under threat everywhere , owing to demagogic attacks on liberal-democratic principles and trump ’s open support for authoritarians .
on both sides of the atlantic , populist politicians regularly mock the idea of an alliance based on shared values , while china and russia continue to expand their spheres of influence unchecked .
turkey ’s recent invasion of northern syria , owing to the betrayal of the kurds who had led the fight against the islamic state ( isis ) , also undercut eu interests .
removing some 70 million jobs , and therefore taxpayers , from the european economy would clearly be disastrous .
leading economists like germany ’s klaus regling , who heads the european stability mechanism , the eurozone ’s bailout fund , calculated a decade ago that the eu ’s shrinking workforce is set to impose severe limits on economic growth .
he forecast that labor shortages are creating a ceiling that restricts annual gdp growth to 1.8 % in the years up to 2030 , and a mere 1.3 % from then to 2050 .
comparatively few europeans seem to contest the moral obligation to accept asylum-seeking refugees fleeing from syria ’s civil war or political oppression elsewhere .
whether or not public sentiment changes in the wake of the paris attacks , economic migrants are viewed more negatively .
at last count , there were some 258 million migrants worldwide , with 22.5 million people registered as refugees by the un refugee agency .
these numbers will be dwarfed if even the most modest climate-related predictions are borne out .
according to the international organization for migration , climate change could displace as many as one billion people by 2050 .
and yet no international treaty covers climate-induced migration – a gap that must be addressed now .
not since 1951 have international standards for refugee protection received so much attention .
lukyanivska prison , kyiv – it has been said that there are no atheists in a foxhole .
here , after my show trial and four and a half months in a cell , i have discovered that there are no atheists in prison , either .
when , despite unbearable pain , you are interrogated – including in your cell – for dozens of hours without a break , and an authoritarian regime ’s entire system of coercion , including its media , is trying to discredit and destroy you once and for all , prayer becomes the only intimate , trusting , and reassuring conversation that one can have .
god , one realizes , is one ’s only friend and only available family , because – deprived even of access to a trusted priest – there is no one else in whom to confide one ’s worries and hopes .
in this season of love and family , the loneliness of a prison cell is almost unbearable .
but , beyond aid reductions , donors may also make it more difficult for borrowing countries to repay the aid funds they owe ( this is not limited to loans for education ) .
and some donors – such as france , germany , and the european investment bank – are lobbying the oecd development assistance committee to count unsubsidized loans as official development assistance to enable them to meet their oda targets .
this reverses the trend over the last few decades toward grant-based financing , especially for basic education .
but education , a crucial public good , should not be left behind in the pursuit of non-grant-based aid .
loan buy-downs can help keep the education sector “ competitive , ” and could prove to be a mechanism to leverage extra resources for education , for which capital-strapped countries may not be willing to borrow otherwise .
ultimately , the enhanced economic activity that development generates is the only way to reduce inequalities , particularly in a context of rapid demographic growth : it is easier to work on a fairer distribution of a growing pie than of a shrinking one .
moreover , fast-paced but ill-distributed economic growth can be accompanied by programs that focus on those who are left behind , thereby mitigating grievances .
it is no coincidence that much of kenya ’s ongoing violence is occurring in the slums of its large cities .
had more attention been given to the country ’s most glaring inequalities in access to water , shelter , or jobs , this population might not have chosen violence as an instrument of change .
let us draw the right lessons from kenya : socio-economic progress remains our best tool to prevent conflict in the long run .
the supply of water is also highly variable across regions and within countries , with floods and droughts occurring at irregular times .
one new factor influencing water supplies is rising global temperature .
although we are not certain about the exact effects , many scientists believe that total annual precipitation will increase , but that its seasonality and the frequency of extremes may also increase .
this would make it difficult to use the existing supply infrastructure of dams , reservoirs , treatment systems , and pipelines without big modifications .
from the writings of the earliest modern commentators on the drivers of socio-economic growth and decline – adam smith , edward gibbon , thomas malthus , david ricardo , and karl marx – we see that concern about exhausting resources is not new .
qaddafi ’s armed forces were chosen on the basis of loyalty and ethnic affiliation , rather than any concept of merit , so the temptation to strip everyone to their underwear and send them home ( to describe what may be the most humane of outcomes ) might be great .
but arguably the most important lesson learned in iraq resulted from the almost catastrophic decision to decommission saddam ’s army without pay or pension .
that move lay at the root of many of iraq ’s subsequent security problems .
libya is fortunate is some ways .
the oil sector appears to be relatively intact , and thus should contribute to government revenues relatively soon .
even aside from the insecurity of new property rights , the gains of privatization are often uncertain at best .
the problem lies in the assumption that most state enterprises have value .
even in the more favorable conditions prevailing in the west , large state ( and many private ) firms often need be broken up , restructured , merged , or shut .
in former communist countries , many ( sometimes most ) big firms were misbegotten from the start .
in the last years of communism investment was almost totally guided by self-serving enterprise bureaucracies .
yet 58 % of africans lack access to electricity , as do large numbers of people throughout the developing world .
the new international initiative , called the “ electrification roadmap , ” grew out of un secretary-general ban ki-moon ’s focus on the importance of energy supplies for achieving the mdgs , as well as from his initiative “ sustainable energy for all ” ( se4all ) , and was officially launched at the rio +20 conference on sustainable development in june 2012 .
as discussions there showed , these issues are receiving increased international attention and funding from governments , business , non-governmental organizations , and development finance institutions .
eskom ’s role is one of leadership and support .
we have electrified more than four million households through a focused effort over a short period – an effort that has featured prominently in discussions held by the un secretary-general ’s advisory council on sustainable energy , and that has drawn interest from other developing countries .
the united nations ’ medium fertility scenario projects that the world ’s population will rise from seven billion today to ten billion by 2050 .
nigeria ’s population could rise from 123 million in 2000 to 440 million by 2050 , while yemen ’s could grow from 18 million to 42 million .
high fertility rates in many countries are partly a consequence of low income .
but causation also runs the other way .
high fertility rates stymie prospects for economic growth , because excessively rapid population growth makes it impossible to accumulate per capita stocks of physical and human capital at the pace required to drive rapid income gains .
all the ingredients of a catastrophic outcome were there .
fast-forward to the present : the economy is growing at a robust 4.2 % rate , led by double-digit export growth in agriculture , mining , manufacturing , energy , tourism , and business services .
at a time when emerging-market economies as diverse as argentina , turkey , nigeria , and south africa face plummeting currencies and rising interest rates , albania has its lowest interest rates on record and a strengthening currency .
it now has the lowest sovereign spread for any country in its rating class , indicating that markets think the rating agencies have been asleep at the wheel .
once the north korea of europe under communist dictator enver hoxha , albania ’s per capita income level is now 25 % that of germany .
conversely , the us must be prepared to lead international efforts to impose severe consequences on any party that plunges the country back into war .
peace and security in darfur should be an essential benchmark for normalized relations between the us and sudan .
the obama administration should hold firm on this through the coming rounds of negotiation , and should appoint a senior official to help coordinate us policy on darfur in order to ensure that peace efforts there receive the same level of attention as the north-south efforts .
what is needed now is political will – and not only in the us – to sustain this diplomacy .
the european union and sudan ’s neighbors – in particular egypt , ethiopia , kenya , and uganda – will also need to play a robust role .
however , new debt is nothing but a form of dope , reducing pressure to take painful measures that would improve competitiveness and capacity growth .
this renewed decline in debt discipline reflects the socialization of potential bankruptcy costs among all eurozone countries by way of establishing joint-liability mechanisms .
it is this de facto debt mutualization that has prompted creditors to accept lower interest rates , and it is only lower interest rates that have permitted renzi , samaras , valls , and the others to distance themselves from austerity policies .
there is nothing surprising about this : when a decision-maker can claim full credit for a policy ’s benefits and collectivize the costs , he will pursue the policy sooner , more quickly , and to a larger extent than he would if he had to bear the costs alone .
what is remarkable is how matter-of-factly europe ’s transgressors succeed in cloaking themselves with the mantle of a new social breakthrough .
and why has n’t the world taken note ?
the story is as complex as indonesia itself .
one leading expert on indonesia , benedict anderson , roots indonesia ’s nature in its core javanese culture , particularly the wayang religious tradition .
according to anderson , “ in contrast to the great religions of the near east … the religion of wayang has no prophet , no message , no bible , no redeemer . … the endless variety and sharp individuality of its dramatis personae indicate that wayang reflects the variegation of human life as it is felt by the javanese ... ”
in short , javanese culture helps indonesia handle the many diverse voices that a new democracy throws up .
it is crucial to engage with the southern mediterranean region as a critical meeting point – a place of political , economic , and energy cooperation .
in this respect , the eu ’s most valuable tools are its signature , nobel prize-winning model of multilateral dialogue and soft power .
next door , russia , too , must respond to new vulnerabilities stemming from changing global conditions .
the kremlin continues to support syrian president bashar al-assad ’s regime , maintaining a strict aversion to military intervention and seeking to defend its strategic interests , including its naval base in the syrian city of tartus .
that stance has translated , most obviously , into repeated vetoes of un security council resolutions aimed at ending a conflict that has already produced tens of thousands of victims .
cairo – last week ’s visit to egypt by king salman of saudi arabia resulted in 22 agreements , including a $ 22 billion oil deal to prop up egypt ’s moribund economy .
but the lavish aid came at a price : egypt had to relinquish two red sea islands ceded to it by saudi arabia in 1950 .
the move exposed the egyptian leadership ’s narrative that the country remains a major regional power as a lie .
indeed , egypt can not even handle domestic challenges posed by a rapidly growing population dependent on unaffordable subsidies – a situation that jihadists are exploiting with much success .
how did the country reach this point ?
in a similar manner , the #bringbackourgirls campaign began online after the renowned nigerian playwright wole soyinka ’s world book day speech , in which he called upon jonathan to “ bring back the pupils . ”
nigerians ’ expressions of outrage online soon translated into organized action offline , led by the former government minister oby ezekwesili ( who also spoke at the world book day event ) and civil-society leaders , including the lawyer maryam uwais and hadiza bala usman .
protests have spread across nigeria , as well as to countries with large nigerian diaspora populations , such as the us , the united kingdom , south africa , and canada .
international media have paid rapt attention , reporting on protests and sit-ins .
the security challenge that nigeria faces dominated discussions during the world economic forum ’s recent meeting in abuja , where the united nations special envoy for global education , former british prime minister gordon brown , unveiled the safe schools initiative .
in early august , russia set a trap in south ossetia , and georgia foolishly walked into it .
if the russians had used their “ peacekeeping ” force solely to protect south ossetians ’ “ self-determination ” ( citing the precedent of western actions in kosovo ) , they would have done little damage to their soft power , and the benefits could have exceeded the costs .
by bombing , blockading , and occupying many parts of georgia , delaying its withdrawal , parading blindfolded georgian soldiers , and failing to protect georgian citizens , russia lost its claims to legitimacy and sowed fear and mistrust in much of the world .
neighbors such as ukraine have become more wary .
an immediate cost was poland ’s reversal of its resistance to an american anti-ballistic missile system .
but a diaspora ’s potential economic importance goes well beyond remittances .
as the late historian philip curtin documented , from the beginning of urban life , millennia ago , trade typically involved networks of co-ethnic merchants living among aliens .
greeks , phoenicians , trans-saharan traders , the hanseatic league , jews , armenians , overseas chinese , and the dutch and british east india companies organized much of world trade through such networks .
although these alien traders were sometimes politically powerful in the host countries , they were often weak and faced discrimination .
the economist avner greif argues that these co-ethnic networks ’ durability and resilience throughout history reflects their ability to enforce contracts at long distances when the existing institutional framework could not do so reliably .
those tariffs increase costs for companies that use metal as an input .
for example , the impact on harley-davidson is to raise costs by about $ 20 million ( or more than $ 2,000 per bike ) .
the european union ’s retaliatory tariffs could cost the company another $ 45 million .
trump ’s signature theme is that , by helping business , he will help all americans .
when government policies reduce the profitability – or threaten the existence – of a company , it is only reasonable that the people running that business should respond as they see fit .
but the selection of experts reflected a clear bias toward the finance ministry ’s views .
in fact , the ministry has used its “ informational campaign ” to shape public discussion , convincing scholars , business economists , and the general public to be more concerned about keeping the budget deficit under control than about the effects of a negative demand shock .
this is a typical example of what economists like joseph stiglitz call “ cognitive capture . ”
for more than two decades – a period characterized by chronic recession and deflation – japan has retained its position as the world ’s richest country in terms of net wealth abroad .
at the end of last year , japan ’s net international wealth amounted to ¥ 296 trillion ( $ 3 trillion ) .
in fact , the great risk nowadays is that with so many genetic descriptions of organisms pouring out , we are drowning in a sea of data but are moving further away from understanding biological complexity .
the basic functional units of all complex living organisms , it should be remembered , are cells , not genes .
what we need now are cell maps and maps of how cells talk to each other .
our first job is to say how many different cells there are in a complex organism .
i think we can now say that for c. elegans .
new york – china ’s massive protest movement in the spring of 1989 , centered in ( but not confined to ) beijing ’s tiananmen square , seems to have been the anti-communist revolt that failed .
as the brutal crackdown on and following june 3-4 played out , political freedom was being won in central europe – first in poland and hungary , and then , beginning that fall , in east germany , czechoslovakia , bulgaria , and , albeit violently and rather undemocratically , romania .
within the next two years , the soviet union , cracked open by mikhail gorbachev ’s reforms , finally imploded .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
from here it is but a short step to proclaiming that the american model can not work in europe because it is socially reprehensible and , in any case , poised to crash any day now .
on the other side of the debate , europe 's desperate reformers see no way to trim , roll back or blow up the continent 's obsessive bureaucracies and consensual politicians .
in today 's europe they see only hints of a possibility – a glass far less than half full – for reform and restructuring , and are impatient at europe 's slow progress .
true , europe is moving at a painfully slow pace , but the attack on the state and its allies in an ossified supply side and the dinosaurs of industrial stake holders , is widening .
new fronts in this war are opening every day .
they simply need the tools , infrastructure , and competence to unlock the continent ’s tremendous agricultural potential .
there is no reason – and no excuse – to leave the survival of millions to unpredictable weather conditions .
rather , countries must take control by drastically improving efficiency and productivity .
to be sure , progress has been made .
some african governments have reduced regulatory barriers to private-sector investment in agriculture .
europeans may be more cheerful , believing that the chinese market will open not only for european engineering products and machine tools to equip the new workshop of the world , but also for luxury goods and even the tourism demanded by a new and affluent chinese middle class .
everyone feels that a seismic shift is under way .
such rapid industrial rises are rare , but not unprecedented .
the most interesting analogies are germany ’s rise in the 19th century and japan ’s in the 20th .
even prior to that time , england was the economic wunderkind of europe .
everyone expects that the current president , the puppet dmitry medvedev , to switch roles with putin after the march elections .
but waiting in the wings is former finance minister alexei kudrin , who could replace medvedev should russia need a factotum of sincerity about economic reform .
kudrin ’s reputation for placid competence might just buy putin some extra time .
but , in putin ’s eyes , this is an unlikely scenario .
the once and future president argues that he has already made russia stronger , and that , as financial uncertainty grips much of the developed world in 2012 , the country has become an island of stability envied by many .
over time , this fueled a surge in low-quality lending , as banks did not have to live with the consequences .
likewise , for those procuring corporate borrowers and bundling corporate clos , volume is its own reward , even if this means lowering standards for borrowers ’ creditworthiness .
the share of “ weakest links ” – corporates rated b - or lower ( with a negative outlook ) – in overall activity has risen markedly since 2013-2015 .
furthermore , not only are the newer issues coming from a lower-quality borrower , the covenants on these instruments – provisions designed to ensure compliance with their terms and thus minimize default risk – have also become lax .
covenant-lite issues are on the rise and now account for about 80 % of the outstanding volume .
one immediate implication of serving on the council will be the need to take positions on matters that in recent years some indian mandarins have preferred to duck – for example , south sudan , whose referendum on independence threatens to spark serious violence in an area where indian un peacekeepers are already serving .
also during india ’s first month as a council member , the future of the un peacekeeping operation in neighboring nepal will be addressed .
before long , the council will also have to consider the implications of the likely commencement of a us troop drawdown in afghanistan , another area of direct importance to india ’s national security .
issues like sanctions on iran , the stop-and-start middle east peace process , and the world ’s response to a likely change of leadership in north korea , will almost certainly appear on the council ’s agenda as well .
all are matters that call for creative and courageous thinking that transcends entrenched positions or reflexive solidarity with “ non-aligned ” countries .
years of opposition politics have turned orban and his allies from young idealists into practical politicians nearing middle age .
that practicality will be sorely tested if they are to succeed .
one problem orban faces will emerge , not from his opponents , but from within his own party ranks .
the fact that fidesz has increased its number of parliamentarians from 20 before the election to 129 now means that many members have never been subjected to the party whip .
moreover , a large number of these new fidesz mps were formerly members of other parties , collapsed right wing parties , not so long ago .
but it is the opponents of liberalism who are wielding it most effectively .
as the far-right french presidential candidate marine le pen puts it , globalization and the liberal institutions that underpin it have become sauvage .
nationalism and traditionalism , meanwhile , have become sources of positive emotion , even if those emotions – nostalgia and a völkisch sense of belonging – are ever-shifting sands .
if liberalism is to survive as a guiding framework for international relations , its proponents must tap into passions of their own .
without disregarding logic and ethics – areas where the liberal world order continues to outshine the alternative – liberals must connect with people on an emotional level .
this sequence of study was devised in 1893 .
i believe that it is obsolete , pedagogically disastrous , and ignores the tremendous scientific advances of the twentieth century .
other industrial nations may cycle through pieces of the disciplines , missing the essential coherence of the p-c-b sequence .
studying science should begin with physics , not biology .
in studying physics , students study algebra simultaneously , motivating them with a sense of the power of mathematics .
until then , income taxes had been used only sporadically to raise funds for wars .
but in britain in 1842 , the income tax became a systemic , permanent feature of the economy .
many at the time rejected the policy altogether , warning that it would destroy incentives and bring the economy to a halt .
fortunately , their hue and cry went unheeded .
owing to today ’s technological advances , the share of total income accruing to labor ( as opposed to capital ) is declining worldwide .
yet sticking to the euro and forcing all of the adjustments in wages risks greater unrest ; indeed , it might merely postpone the inevitable .
governments and the bond market will test the seriousness of the newly agreed fiscal guidelines ( if they are ratified ) .
while talk is tough now , the history of such agreements does not inspire optimism .
before the financial crisis , even germany violated the eu stability and growth pact ’s ( sgp ) deficit limits .
in the us , the 1980 ’s deficit limits set by the gramm-rudman-hollings law were not met , and , like the sgp , were revised and extended .
between the mtfa , the efsm , and payments to third countries , the total exposure this year is € 70.5 billion .
some borrowing over the seven-year mff period may be possible , while upholding the medium-term objective of a balanced budget .
such leveraging of the eu budget would complement the recently established european stabilization mechanism ( the successor to the efsm ) and the mtfa .
countries receiving assistance should be given the option of applying for an anticipated disbursement of eu funds .
following a request by a member state , the commission would be entitled to borrow on capital markets under the implicit eu budget guarantee , with the maximum amount determined by the size of the country ’s unused ( pre-allocated ) structural and cohesion funds .
indeed , japan ’s desire to continue to kill whales is no less motivated by “ emotion ” than environmentalists ’ opposition to it .
eating whales is not necessary for the health or better nutrition of the japanese .
it is a tradition that they wish to continue , presumably because some japanese are emotionally attached to it .
the japanese do have one argument that is not so easily dismissed .
they claim that western countries object to whaling because , for them , whales are a special kind of animal , as cows are for hindus .
abolition of taxes on realized capital gains increased the sales of shares enormously .
international equity funds stepped in , providing companies with urgently needed liquidity while disentangling the traditional ownership network .
germany , inc. is on its last legs .
the good news is that germany ’s overblown conglomerates are being scaled down to an efficient size and that the capital market is able to do its job , improving the allocation of resources .
the bad news is that financial capital is moving abroad to finance other overblown conglomerates .
talks would likely be suspended ; we would be back to where we were two years ago but with an overlay of recrimination and mistrust .
even absent such developments , drift is not desirable .
north korea could use the passage of time to increase the number of nuclear weapons in its arsenal and make some improvements to its warheads and delivery systems without overt testing .
there is a big difference between a north korea armed with a handful of inefficient warheads and inaccurate missiles and one with dozens of advanced weapons that could be mounted on accurate long-range missile systems capable of reaching the us .
at this point , any realistic policy must begin with accepting the reality that complete and fully verifiable denuclearization is not a realistic prospect any time soon .
fortunately , the bond markets are dead , and it might take a year to revive them .
their absence makes it difficult to invest too large amounts of money in russian securities .
something fundamental has changed in the russian economy .
a time comes when all disasters have occurred and all stupidities are recognized .
for russia , august 1998 marked that dividing line .
they walked , bussed , traveled in carts , telephoned and tweeted with compatriots , motivated in part by social demands – above all for their own empowerment .
the contrast between this dynamic space for open protest and saudi arabia could hardly be starker .
saudi women find themselves living in a petrified system .
faces of the royal family are seen everywhere ; the faces of women are shrouded , forcibly hidden .
nowhere else in the world do we see modernity experienced as such a problem .
in this scenario , you will have to forgo all the well-known economic benefits of the global division of labor .
between these two extremes lies most of the world as it is , characterized by regional integration projects like the eu or the north american free trade agreement .
we can identify important swings during the history of capitalism over the last two centuries , either toward the market or the state .
for example , the repeal of the corn laws in the uk in 1846 favored a free market in international trade and accelerated globalization until the outbreak of world war i.
after wwi , the pendulum swung back toward the state .
japan has a strong international reputation when it comes to managing natural disasters .
but the “ perfect storm ” of the largest earthquake and tsunami since industrialization , and the resulting meltdown of three reactor cores at the fukushima daiichi plant , went beyond any scenario previously envisaged .
japan ’s national government and local communities had no emergency plan for the situation that they faced in the contaminated areas , resulting in ad hoc responses marked by inefficiency and poor communication , particularly with regard to radiological risk .
despite such problems , effective measures were implemented to evacuate those at risk and limit the potential hazard from consumption of contaminated foodstuffs .
local communities initiated immediate decontamination of sensitive areas outside evacuated zones ( for example , kindergartens and schools ) , in parallel with efforts by the japan atomic energy agency ( jaea ) to develop the technology for remediation within these zones .
today , with both kirchner and chávez out of the picture , that period of leftist populism is drawing to a close .
chávez ’s successor , nicolás maduro , lacks experience and influence in foreign affairs .
kirchner ’s successor , his widow cristina fernández de kirchner , is struggling .
she recently suffered a heavy defeat in her peronist party ’s recent primaries , weakening its chances in the upcoming mid-term congressional elections and undermining her authority during her remaining two years in office .
in addition , she is now facing a legislative election in poor health , following surgery to remove a subdural hematoma in her brain .
the three new agencies will not only enforce common technical standards , which may eventually become binding throughout the eu if endorsed by the european commission , but will also be allowed to settle disputes between national supervisors .
more important , should the council declare a state of financial emergency – such as the one we are in currently – the eu agencies might exceptionally be given a position of predominance over national supervisory authorities .
needless to say , “ disputes ” and “ emergencies ” are exactly the future situations likely to matter most to national policymakers and taxpayers .
if decisions about systemically important national financial institutions are made at the european level in good times , while in bad times national taxpayers pick up the tab , the whole eu will lose .
in good times , we probably would not be able to tell the difference , but the grim reality is that such an arrangement would be unlikely to prevent another crisis .
this week , there were two more attacks on schoolchildren both in afghanistan , one at a girls ’ school , where staff were bludgeoned and bombs set off , and the other at a neighboring boys ’ school , where a classroom was sprayed with bullets .
the number of casualties in both assaults remains unknown .
but the cause is all too well known : there is a war against education .
more than 28 million out-of-school children are growing up in conflict zones , including places like the afghan-pakistan border , the fringes of myanmar , and south sudan .
all of them are vulnerable to extremist violence .
one hopes that this task has been made slightly simpler by the publication of a book in which the copenhagen consensus economists boil down their insights .
here ’s one fact to consider : the entire death toll from the southeast asian tsunami is matched each month by the number of worldwide casualties of hiv/aids .
a comprehensive prevention program providing free or cheap condoms and information about safe sex to the regions worst affected by hiv/aids would cost $ 27 billion and save more than 28 million lives .
this , say the economists who took part in the copenhagen consensus , makes it the single best investment that the world could possibly make .
the social benefits would outweigh the costs by 40 to one .
louis uchitelle of the new york times quotes the highly intelligent catherine mann commenting on the " co-dependent relationship … between the us and its trading partners , " which might " last for quite some time , " because " the us and its main trading partners have a vested interest in the status quo . "
japan , china , and other export-oriented east asian economies are indeed eager to keep the value of the dollar relatively high , and their central banks have piled up close to $ 2 trillion in dollar-denominated assets .
china 's government regards the threat of capital losses on its dollar-denominated securities as less important than the need to maintain near-full employment in coastal manufacturing cities like shanghai .
after all , the ruling communist oligarchs have grown accustomed to a comfortable lifestyle .
the last thing they want is mass unemployment and urban unrest to call their positions into question .
washington , dc – not long ago , the separation of financial supervision and monetary policy was in vogue in many countries .
some countries – like the united kingdom and australia – went so far as to unbundle these functions by assigning responsibility for financial stability to specialized agencies and extricating their central banks from financial supervisory issues altogether .
in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , however , financial supervision and macroeconomic management have been forced to reunite .
this rapprochement is a consequence of the growing recognition that asset-price cycles must be taken into account for both macroeconomic management and financial supervision .
prior to the crisis , asset-price cycles were seen by many as basically harmless or , at least , as a relatively insignificant monetary-policy channel .
seoul – if you chase two rabbits at once , the old saying goes , both will escape .
and yet this is precisely what many governments are required to do : pursue both growth and distributional fairness .
the two objectives , though not incompatible , are entirely different from one another , and few policy tools can simultaneously help to achieve both .
this idea matters a lot in trade policy .
much theoretical and empirical research demonstrates that opening trade can spur a country ’s gdp growth .
the ttip is not just about the us and the eu .
mexico already has an fta with the eu , and canada is negotiating one .
at some point , nafta and ttip will need to be harmonized .
meanwhile , the world ’s other countries – still accounting for more than half of world gdp and the bulk of global trade and fdi – are wondering how the ttip would affect each of them .
one possibility , suggested by my ex-colleague , former us trade representative carla hills , is that a successful ttip would be a major impetus for rekindling the moribund doha round of global free-trade talks .
indeed , sovereigns are dumping a larger fraction of their public debt onto banks ’ balance sheet , especially in the eurozone .
to prevent a disorderly outcome in the eurozone , today ’s fiscal austerity should be much more gradual , a growth compact should complement the eu ’s new fiscal compact , and a fiscal union with debt mutualization ( eurobonds ) should be implemented . in addition , a full banking union , starting with eurozone-wide deposit insurance , should be initiated , and moves toward greater political integration must be considered , even as greece leaves the eurozone .
unfortunately , germany resists all of these key policy measures , as it is fixated on the credit risk to which its taxpayers would be exposed with greater economic , fiscal , and banking integration .
as a result , the probability of a eurozone disaster is rising .
and , while the cloud over the eurozone may be the largest to burst , it is not the only one threatening the global economy .
this so-called “ string of pearls ” strategy directly threatens india ’s national-security interests , rendering the type of robust bilateral relationship that would benefit both countries next to impossible .
of course , china claims that its intentions toward india are peaceful .
for example , it contends that its efforts to establish bases in the indian ocean and bolster its blue-water navy are aimed at safeguarding the malacca straits , a maritime trade route that is perceived as a choke point for the chinese economy .
but actions speak louder than words – and the message that china ’s behavior is sending is far from peaceful .
indeed , chinese leaders seem to be taking advantage of the opening provided by an overstretched united states to assert control over a broad expanse of asia ’s oceans .
european opponents of a map for ukraine and georgia argue that neither country is ready for nato membership .
too many question marks about their national unity are said to exist , too many internal conflicts linger , and their records on political and judicial reforms are supposedly dubious .
but the map process does not imply an automatic right to nato membership .
on the contrary , maps would put heavy demands on ukraine and georgia .
both would have to answer a lot of difficult questions and convince others that they are able to live up to nato ’s democratic requirements before being allowed to join .
but , like donald trump , it was le pen who ran as the “ voice of the people , ” whereas macron , like hillary clinton , was depicted as a puppet of bankers , cultural elites , and international plutocrats .
so what do left and right still mean , if anything at all ?
there is little doubt that something shifted in the last decades of the twentieth century .
left-wing parties began to lose – in some countries more quickly than others – their base in the industrial working class .
redistribution of wealth became gradually less important than the social emancipation of ethnic and sexual minorities .
one risk is that north korea will over the next few years come to possess a significant arsenal that will pose a meaningful threat to the us .
another is that north korea ’s neighbors , including south korea and japan , will determine that they , too , need nuclear weapons given the north korean threat and their diminished confidence in the reliability of the us and its guarantees to protect them with its nuclear forces .
the danger in both regions is that a race to acquire nuclear weapons could trigger a preventive war .
even if such a war were avoided , the presence of multiple nuclear arsenals would increase the temptation for one or more countries to strike first in a crisis .
“ use them or lose them ” has the potential to become a recipe for instability and conflict when capabilities are not sufficiently robust to absorb an attack and still be able to mete out the sort of devastating retaliation essential for effective deterrence .
at a summit meeting in 2013 at the sunnylands retreat in california , president barack obama showed china ’s president xi jinping the evidence that members of the chinese military had been stealing industrial technology .
the chinese accepted the evidence , agreed that stealing industrial technology was different from other forms of espionage , and said that the chinese government would not assist in such theft in the future .
since that is not enough to stop other chinese theft of us civilian and military technology , the new nss rightly stresses that the us government will take further steps to stop it .
when it turns to specific trade policies , the nss emphasizes that the us will seek to “ break down trade barriers and provide americans with opportunities to increase their exports . ”
this emphasis on increasing exports , rather than reducing imports , is a welcome feature .
many chinese mistakenly concluded that this represented a shift in the balance of global power , and that the us was in decline .
but such narratives can lead to conflict .
indeed , overconfidence in assessing its power led to more assertive chinese foreign-policy behavior in the latter part of 2009 and 2010 .
china miscalculated by deviating from the smart strategy of a rising power and violating deng ’s dictum that china should proceed cautiously and “ skillfully keep a low profile . ”
after chinese leaders faced international criticism and deteriorating relations with the us , japan , india , and other countries , they decided to return to deng ’s smart-power strategy .
but since then , the country has run into trouble and become the recipient of record-breaking support from the international monetary fund .
argentina has fallen back into crisis for the simple reason that not enough has changed since the last debacle .
as such , the country ’s economic and financial foundations have remained vulnerable to both internal and external shocks .
although they have been committed to an ambitious reform program , argentina ’s economic and financial authorities have also made several avoidable mistakes .
fiscal discipline and structural reforms have been unevenly applied , and the central bank has squandered its credibility at key moments .
attempts by economists to predict the future have had mixed results , at best ; very few foresaw the depth of the great recession , even after it had already started .
the trouble lies in the fact that many of the leading indicators used to measure the economy rely on out-of-date , incomplete , or flawed data .
for example , forecasters calculate real gdp on the basis of initial monthly estimates of quarterly gdp – a statistic that is often substantially revised as more data become available .
as a result , forecasts lag behind reality .
during the third quarter of 2008 , fewer than 30 % of the forecasters who contribute to the survey of professional forecasters predicted a decline in gdp in the remaining months of the year ; in fact , gdp plunged more than 8 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 , one of the largest drops on record .
fighting in kosovo is the first significant conflict which , for one side at least , involves no considerations of strategy , territory , population , natural resources , or even ideology .
the west is fighting a war over principles , a war , as president clinton put it , " to end a moral tragedy . "
at issue is an attempt to stop an epidemic , the carriers of which in 20th century europe have been nazism , communism , fascism , and now , nationalism .
nato , for the first time , has intervened in the internal affairs of another country .
this is a significant change in nato policy , which downgrades the idea of the sovereignty of states and elevates the status of ethical norms in international relations .
building codes already guard against dangers like fire and earthquakes .
far-sighted governments in places as different as germany and singapore are now mandating green buildings .
policymakers there know that governments have a role in mandating regulations to create a level playing field and helping build industry capacity .
california ’s latest building and appliance standards are expected to avoid the need for five large power plants in the next 10 years .
buildings last for decades , so decisions made today have a long-term impact on our energy consumption .
nevertheless , the effort to preempt american strategy clearly failed , as new un sanctions were implemented earlier this month .
as the deal was intended to avoid a nuclear standoff with iran , why was there so much outrage in the us and the west ?
i fear it is because the us found itself denied its primacy in setting global policy on iran .
instead of trying to explore the possibilities presented by the brazilian/turkish opening , the us quickly pushed the un security council for more sanctions ( the fourth round so far ) on iran .
this forced brazil and turkey , both currently non-permanent members of the security council , to vote against the sanctions resolution .
they chose , without explanation , to divide debt-to-gdp ratios into the following categories : under 30 % , 30-60 % , 60-90 % , and over 90 % .
and it turns out that growth rates decline in all of these categories as the debt-to-gdp ratio increases , only somewhat more in the last category .
there is also the issue of reverse causality .
debt-to-gdp ratios tend to increase for countries that are in economic trouble .
if this is part of the reason that higher debt-to-gdp ratios correspond to lower economic growth , there is less reason to think that countries should avoid a higher ratio , as keynesian theory implies that fiscal austerity would undermine , rather than boost , economic performance .
as a result , policies forcing people and businesses to shift to immature technologies will slow growth and exacerbate energy poverty .
this is also why the world is much further behind in its “ energy transition ” than most people realize .
solar and wind together currently deliver about 1 % of global energy , and the international energy agency estimates this will reach only 4.1 % by 2040 .
vaclav smil , who is bill gates ’s favorite energy expert , says that “ claims of a rapid transition to a zero-carbon society are plain nonsense , ” adding that “ even a greatly accelerated shift towards renewables would not be able to relegate fossil fuels to minority contributors to the global energy supply anytime soon , certainly not by 2050 . ”
many of today ’s panicky political declarations and climate protests are driven by the widespread belief that the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) told us we have just 12 years left to save the planet .
fewer africans working in rich countries will automatically translate into less money circulating in african countries .
the decline in remittances , however , cuts both ways .
remittances have long spurred inflation in many parts of africa .
a ugandan doctor working in norway , for instance , cares little about the cost of a beer in kampala .
he is also willing – and able – to pay more than a local doctor for services and , of course , a home in uganda .
in europe , by contrast , greater weight is placed on the avoidance of risk , which is undermining private-sector confidence in investing in innovation .
the eu ’s goal – to protect human health and the environment – is laudable .
but it is impossible to mitigate all risk , so aiming for this is not feasible .
rather , the precautionary principle should be used judiciously and rationally , balancing potential risks with the benefits that innovation and new technology might offer .
this notion of risk underpins economic interactions .
ramallah – palestinians and israelis have different and possibly contradictory expectations from the indirect negotiations that the united states has pushed both sides into beginning .
israel was among the first parties to welcome the arab league ’s reluctant decision to back palestinian president mahmoud abbas ’s call for arabs to give their blessing to the talks .
it is clear that for israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu ’s right-wing government , the start of indirect talks without freezing settlement activities in the west bank and jerusalem is a sort of victory .
just to remind the world of this , as the indirect talks were preparing to get off the ground , israel ’s government approved a decision to break ground on 112 housing units in a settlement south of bethlehem , and 1600 new settlement units in east jerusalem .
for palestinians , the return to talks , albeit indirect , is focused on one strategic issue : borders .
for while the moral hazard argument emphasizes the orthodox commandment `` thou shall not intervene , '' the crucial feature of globalization hazard is market failure .
unlike moral hazard , market failure highlights circumstances in which government intervention is both socially desirable and economically defensible .
that the failure of international capital markets led to sudden and devastating capital outflows after 1996 is only one such episode .
consider other devastating events that are uninsured ( and often uninsurable ) in the private sector .
in the us , for example , floods , hurricanes , earthquakes , and tornadoes trigger immediate federal assistance .
thus , although european countries remained democratic , the eu institutions , where sovereignty over crucial decisions was transferred , have remained democracy-free .
as margaret thatcher explained during her last parliamentary appearance as british prime minister , who controls money and interest rates controls the politics of europe .
handing europe ’s money and politics to a cartel administration did not only spell the end of european democracy ; it has also fueled a vicious cycle of authoritarianism and poor economic results .
the more europe ’s establishment chokes off democracy , the less legitimate its political authority becomes .
that leads european leaders to double down on authoritarianism in order to stick to their failed policies when recessionary economic forces strengthen .
tokyo – the scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan in march was far greater than even the authorities ’ worst scenarios foresaw .
nearly six months later , the total damage remains difficult to estimate .
social unrest and confusion , as well as radiation leaks from the fukushima nuclear power plant , continue .
and now the country has absorbed another huge blow : another downgrade of its bond ratings .
both moody ’s and standard & poor ’s now rate japanese bonds at only their fourth-highest level .
even if the accuracy of iranian missiles can not be guaranteed , many of them could still evade defensive systems .
israel ’s state-of-the-art iron dome anti-missile defenses , for example , have been unable even to neutralize all the primitive missiles launched from gaza .
moreover , the iranian regime has forged a network of proxy forces across the region .
syria and iraq have become crucial links in an iran-led shia strategic arc stretching from afghanistan to lebanon .
the regime ’s proxy forces include segments of afghanistan ’s shia population , iraqi shia militias , and hezbollah , which controls southern lebanon and has thousands of rockets ready to target israel .
indeed , rasheed notes that at every us screening of his film , audiences need to apologize before they begin to relate to rasheed as a filmmaker rather than as a representative of his country .
“ personally , i do not ask anything ; i ’m here to clear up some confusion by the medium of film . ”
iraq , ravaged by war and now shaken daily by violence , is known as the most intellectually inclined of the arab countries .
as iraqi and other muslim intellectuals in the region often repeat : “ books are written in egypt , printed in lebanon , and read in iraq . ”
here is hoping that raheed and his colleagues continue to build up an iraqi culture that is vibrant and free ; and here is hoping that the relationship of us and international audiences to rasheed goes from one of expiation to one of engagement with his work .
complicating matters further for china , the rush to create an open , market-oriented economy has fueled corruption and rent-seeking .
and , as recent european post-crisis experience has shown , it is politically very difficult to carry out structural reforms when vested interests have captured the regulatory system .
that is why chinese president xi jinping has been engaged in a comprehensive anti-corruption campaign – often misrepresented as a power grab – since assuming office in 2012 .
yet china ’s problems extend beyond structural imbalances to two types of cyclical macroeconomic risks .
the first risk stems from the business cycles in advanced , market-based economies , where interest rates , inflation rates , and growth rates rise and fall together .
moreover , trade also carries much broader benefits for society .
economic globalization has been shown to reduce child mortality and extend life expectancy , owing to increased incomes and better information .
in the us , trade over the past half-century has increased longevity significantly .
in uganda , freer trade in the past 35 years has been shown to lengthen the average lifespan by 2-3 years .
what ’s more , “ free trade is good for the environment , ” to quote one academic study .
the permanent structured cooperation in the field of defense – agreed by the european council last december – is a good place to start , with countries increasing , for example , joint strategic planning at the european level .
inspired by german chancellor angela merkel ’s recent proposal to tie eu funding to the acceptance of migrants , member states should also work to create stronger incentives for cooperation .
there is no question that it is difficult for 27 sovereign countries to act as one .
but , as tempting as it may be , trying to paper over differences or avoid dissent – let alone destroying the compact at the core of the european project – will not make matters any easier .
the only way to get where europe needs to go is through a realistic and gradual effort to build unity .
to be sure , the media are under attack like never before , and not only from fake news and polarizing presidents .
the slaying of nine journalists in kabul on april 30 , in back-to-back suicide bombings that killed at least 25 people , marked the deadliest day for journalists in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , and added to a grim global tally .
according to reporters without borders , more than 1,000 journalists have been murdered around the world in the last 15 years , and only a handful of the perpetrators have been brought to justice .
and yet fresh glimmers of hope are multiplying .
around the world , journalists and their supporters are fighting back in encouraging ways .
seven decades ago , the developed world accounted for most of the world ’s income but only 15 % of its population .
now , billions of people have been lifted out of poverty and are wealthier , healthier , and have more opportunities .
future historians may well remember this period as humankind ’s greatest exercise in inclusiveness to date .
yet not so long ago , almost no one saw it coming .
this unanticipated megatrend has unforeseen corollaries .
in the 1980 ’s , for example , the soviet leadership warned that any reform would enable germany to control poland .
indeed , it responded to the polish opposition ’s rise by castigating them as tools of western power , stalking horses for american or german interests that would ultimately exploit ordinary poles .
at the same time , the communist government emphasized how incoherent the opposition was , owing to the tensions inherent in a marriage of economic liberals , leftist workers , conservative catholics , and nationalists .
nurturing suspicions about who was backing whom helped to drive wedges between the various groups .
polish foreign minister radosław sikorski ’s recent call for more assertive leadership by germany demonstrates how different poland ’s worldview is today .
the inter-parliamentary union ranks japan 158th out of 189 countries in terms of its ratio of female mps .
things are just as bad at lower levels of government , where women account for a mere 13.1 % of representatives in local parliaments , more than 40 % of which have no female members at all .
as the leader of the liberal democratic party , abe should instruct local party branches to choose more female candidates to run in next april ’s local elections .
but , at least so far , abe seems to lack the will to do so ( though he may choose to work with local party bosses behind the scenes to bring in more women ) .
it is also worrying that some of the women abe has selected for his cabinet and for key party posts are arch-conservatives who advocate that women stay at home and take care of children .
living a long time is one of our deepest wishes , and medical and economic progress offers the hope that it will be fulfilled .
some scientists say that the average human lifespan could reach 90 years or more by mid-century .
but what if our wish is granted ?
what good is a longer life if we can not maintain our standard of living ?
the fundamental difficulty in planning for enhanced longevity is that we do not know whether it will really happen .
so , in introducing a new style of governance , exemplified by merit-based cabinet appointments , jokowi must be careful not to alienate the political and business elites who have long benefited from their tight grip on power .
in short , if jokowi is to form a national consensus on the institutions that indonesia needs , he will have to reach across this political divide .
to this end , mexican president enrique peña nieto ’s cross-party “ pact for mexico ” could serve as a useful model .
promisingly , jokowi has a reputation for independence from partisan and religious politics , and a talent for communicating with the people .
and , as a political outsider , he is in a unique position to direct indonesia toward a more prosperous , united future – and vault himself into the country ’s pantheon of great leaders .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
the imf is too political a body to act as the systemic-risk watchdog .
the next g-20 summit should implement a fundamental reform of the fsb .
it should give the fsb a legal personality , enshrined in an international treaty .
currently , the board has no formal status and only a small , though high-quality , permanent staff , hosted by the bank for international settlements in basel .
draghi ’s successor as chairman should be a full-time appointee , and the fsb should be given powers to direct the other standard setters , review the implementation of standards by individual countries , and publish the results .
the case also attracted attention in the west .
dozens of pop stars , from pete townshend and paul mccartney to madonna , rallied in support of the women .
of course , pussy riot could hardly be classified as musicians .
they were more interested in creating visual images .
both the feminist chants and the primitive chords were secondary to the spectacle .
the department of petroleum resources ( dpr ) , the regulatory agency for the oil industry , has dismissed these claims , vowing to impose hefty fines on companies that flout the deadline .
in the early 1990 ’s , desperately short of hard currency , nigeria negotiated contracts permitting the oil companies to develop new fields and recoup their investment before sharing profits .
now , following the companies ’ discovery of massive reserves , technocrats appointed by yar ’ adua to take charge of oil policy want nigeria to get a larger slice of the pie .
that also means ending government co-financing of operating costs and demanding that the oil companies tap capital markets to bridge the shortfall .
moreover , tony chukwueke , the dpr ’s head , has announced plans to create an african version of petronas , malaysia ’s state-run oil company , and transform the sclerotic nigerian national petroleum corporation into a powerful oil-producing firm that can dominate the market in the gulf of guinea and other emerging regions .
moscow – in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in the united states , the so-called “ war on terror ” was launched .
but the us-led military invasions of afghanistan and iraq were not the whole of it ; many countries also ramped up monitoring and policing of domestic media and ordinary citizens .
freedom of expression and personal privacy , governments claimed , would have to be curtailed for the sake of security .
the damage has been particularly pronounced in russia , where anti-terror regulations have often been used as a tool to muffle the voices of those who offer independent or alternative views , particularly views that are critical of president vladimir putin ’s government .
by using security as a pretext to flout russia ’s media legislation , which explicitly protects journalists from censorship , the government has undermined journalism considerably .
but , as edmund burke famously pointed out , “ your representative owes you , not his industry only , but his judgment , and he betrays , instead of serving you , if he sacrifices it to your opinion . ”
the populist campaigns in the major referendums this year have differed in important respects .
for example , colombian opponents of the peace deal appealed to universal norms of justice for war crimes committed by the military and the farc , not to national particularism , as in the uk and the netherlands .
nonetheless , they have all been motivated by a desire to scuttle governments and institutions that they oppose .
and they have all been willing to follow the tradition of dictators , and to resort to smears , distortions , and fantastical claims .
to a bookish young man , allen , the anxious intellectual who still gets the girl , was a kind of role model .
but now that we know the accusations against the comedian and movie director , we are forced , in scott ’s view , to reappraise the work in that light .
there may be something sinister and immoral in the films that we should take into account .
in other words , bad behavior , or even alleged bad behavior , can taint an artistic work , because the artist can not be separated from his art .
this is at least a more interesting proposition than the notion that art should be disqualified just because we do n’t like the way the artist behaved in private .
and public officials are being prosecuted as well .
guatemala 's former president , otto pérez molina , was forced to resign and was subsequently jailed for corruption .
indonesia ’s house speaker setya novanto was also forced to resign , after he was caught attempting to extort money from a subsidiary of the mining company freeport-mcmoran .
and indonesia ’s special court for corruption crimes has just sentenced the country ’s former minister of energy and mineral resources , jero wacik , to four years in prison .
journalism has played a larger role as well .
most economists agree on the ideal mix and sequencing of such maneuvers .
a so-called “ beautiful de-leveraging ” entails a combination of internal reforms , financing , and judicious use of the market pricing mechanism .
but what looks good in theory has proved difficult to implement in practice .
for one thing , politicians are more likely to continue increasing their countries ’ reliance on financing , thereby heightening the risk of disorderly market adjustments , than they are to implement difficult structural reforms and fiscal adjustments .
for this reason , many countries have endured painful disruptions that have aggravated possibly avoidable falls in output , caused unemployment to surge , and , in the worst cases , eroded potential growth .
stanford – in march , the german tabloid bild published an article based on a secret document that reveals how breakaway areas of eastern ukraine are “ being treated as parts of russia ’s sovereign territory . ”
the revelations cast the ongoing minsk 2 peace negotiations in a new light , one that illuminates the frustration being expressed by the ukrainian government .
the document obtained by bild is a report from an october meeting of russia ’s “ inter-ministerial commission for the provision of humanitarian aid for the affected areas in the southeast of the regions of donetsk and luhansk . ”
it describes how the meeting ’s attendees did not just focus on humanitarian assistance , but rather served as a sort of shadow government .
working groups cooperating with russian authorities were set up to manage the region ’s finances , economic policies , energy and transportation infrastructure , and trade .
let us be very clear , too , about “ renegotiating the terms of membership , ” the refuge of those who want to leave but want to persuade people that it really is just an adjustment of the relationship .
when , in the course of the “ adjustment , ” the going gets very rough ( as it will ) , they will say , “ well , it ’s a pity , but now it seems that adjustment is not enough . ”
if britain focuses over the next few years not on how it can help europe recover and prosper , but rather on how it can change its own relationship with europe , there should be no doubt about the temper and frame of mind that our current partners will bring to that negotiation .
there will be varying degrees of politeness .
but they will not thank us and will not accommodate us .
it is also depriving the continent of talents and contributions needed to drive development and progress .
a 2011 african development bank report finds that “ getting women into science and technology ultimately promises to benefit society as a whole . ”
gender equity in stem is achievable , and many african scholars are showing the world how to do it .
but they need help , and programs that offer scholarships and support are among the best ways to achieve parity in the sciences .
the causes of africa ’s stem gender imbalance are often compared to a leaky pipe : girls start out with interest and aptitude , but drop out of the disciplines at various points in their education .
and however farfetched a global currency may sound , recall that before world war i , ditching the gold standard seemed equally implausible .
the current system is both risky and inefficient .
different monies are not only a nuisance for tourists who arrive home with pockets full of unspendable foreign coins .
global firms waste time and resources on largely futile efforts to hedge currency risk ( benefiting only the banks that act as middlemen ) .
the benefits of ridding the world of national currencies would be enormous .
what they have not done is engage the international community with a comprehensive counterproposal .
their offer – which would have to go much further than the 2002 arab peace initiative or a portfolio of relevant united nations resolutions – could even incorporate the kushner plan as part of the transition to a final settlement .
in the past , transitional agreements have amounted to what george orwell called “ catastrophic gradualism . ”
but , with the inclusion of a robust economic strategy , this could be transformed into “ auspicious gradualism . ”
after all , economic development would go a long way toward stabilizing palestinian society in preparation for statehood , drastically boosting the peace settlement ’s chances of long-term success .
the caning of kartika , on the other hand , is not an example of political manipulation , and for this reason is perhaps even more worrisome .
her sentence was roundly supported by modernist muslim intellectuals , who insisted that the punishment was justly applied and can not be questioned because it has divine sanction .
these are not politicians , but former idealists who are happy that their goals of islamicizing the state are being realized .
most are anti-umno and support the pas .
as a result , the umno finds itself squeezed between an islamic lobby that presses for greater “ talibanization ” of the country and the rising voices of international critics , who can not be ignored , because the party needs both radical supporters and foreign investors to stay in power .
the us would , of course , need to respond to the conclusion of any trilateral northeast asian fta in order to preserve its own role in global trade – and in the supply chains that dominate the asian economies .
it would likely seek to expand and deepen the infant trans-pacific partnership , the trade agreement that president barack obama committed the us to last year .
in particular , the us would strongly encourage japan to join the tpp , because the us might want a united asia-pacific economic community , rather than a division between asia and the pacific .
because japan would not want to be disconnected from the us for strategic reasons , it might indeed accept america ’s invitation .
in this scenario , both japan and south korea would have to find some means to bridge a sino-centric asia and a us-centered pacific .
as the premier pan-european union institution , the ecb is uniquely positioned to play a leadership role in europe ’s discussion of fiscal policy , trade policy , and demographic transition .
but , while it quietly makes a number of important technical contributions to various debates , it is hemmed in politically and thus can not reach forcefully beyond its jurisdiction .
this is an unfortunate limitation of the ecb ’s design by a group of nation states that have not yet decided whether they prefer greater unity or greater devolution .
for the boj , the fundamental problem is its deep institutional fear of rocking the boat politically , and thus its inability to play the role of chief economist .
as a result , america ’s fed chairman today commands super-normal influence .
these results were foreshadowed by a study last year , by anne case and angus deaton , which showed that life expectancy was on the decline for large segments of the population – including america ’s so-called angry men of the rust belt .
but , with the incomes of the bottom 90 % having stagnated for close to a third of a century ( and declining for a significant proportion ) , the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for very large swaths of the country .
and while america might be at the extreme of this trend , things were little better elsewhere .
but , if it seemed clear that there would be political consequences , their form and timing were far less obvious .
why did the backlash in the us come just when the economy seemed to be on the mend , rather than earlier ?
aside from the annapolis talks , which seem to be going nowhere because of the parties ’ irreconcilable differences over the core issues , all the other peace efforts are more tactical than strategic .
in none of them do the conditions yet exist for an immediate leap from war to peace , nor do the parties themselves expect that to happen .
it would require bold statesmanship to turn the cease-fire with hamas into a prelude to political talks .
indeed , both israel and the united states are adamant about excluding hamas from the annapolis process unless and until it recognizes israel ’s right to exist , while hamas will not abandon its identity as a resistance movement merely to join negotiations that seem unlikely to satisfy the palestinian people ’s minimal requirements .
for israel , the cease-fire with hamas reflects its reluctance to become mired in another asymmetric war like the one it fought in lebanon two summers ago , this time in the alleys of gaza ’s refugee camps .
specifically , germany , europe ’s greatest economic power , and france , the intellectual progenitor of european unification , should announce their simultaneous exit from the euro and re-adoption of the deutsche mark and the franc .
this would trigger the immediate revaluation of the deutsche mark – and possibly of the franc – relative to the euro .
for their part , other eu member countries would have to decide whether to retain the euro in its truncated form or revert to their own national currencies , possibly pegging them to the revived deutsche mark or franc .
regardless of their decision , the price competitiveness of the eurozone ’s weaker economies would improve considerably .
of course , france and germany would need to implement interim arrangements to safeguard their banking systems ’ stability .
thus , the islamic revolutionaries in 1979 made a point of preserving the zoroastrian fire temples .
in its muslim era , iran has boasted of some of the greatest poets , writers , and scientists in the world .
none of this would have been possible if iran ’s ancient muslim rulers had not allowed academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas and expression – something that is sorely missing in today ’s islamic republic .
other autocratic rulers in the muslim world are learning from iran ’s example , cracking down hard on intellectuals , journalists , lawyers , women activists , or just about anyone who has ideas and wants to exchange them with others .
for such muslim rulers , intellectuals are the new global terrorists , bombarding their regimes with intellectualism .
the leadership group would thus constitute an important public demonstration of governments ’ commitment to addressing and resolving core issues , and it would provide a desperately needed vehicle for translating their resolve into action .
its direct ties to us president barack obama , russian president vladimir putin , and european leaders would distinguish it from existing arrangements .
initially , the leadership group could include representatives from a core group of states – for example , france , germany , italy , poland , russia , sweden , ukraine , the united kingdom , and the united states – directly empowered by and connected to their presidents and prime ministers .
to ensure broad membership and transparency across europe and within existing structures , the leadership group should include a representative from the osce , the european union , the eurasian economic union , and nato .
the leadership group ’s first priority would be to address the current crisis .
as some confidence returns in an eventually recapitalized banking system , and long bond yields decline with the fall in inflation , mortgage and other borrowing rates will fall and monetary transmission mechanisms will revive , supporting economic activity and stabilizing real house prices , albeit at a substantially lower level .
finally , there are two major differences between the 1930 ’s and the present .
the industrial world is now far more dependent on ( mostly foreign ) oil than it was then .
the extreme rise in real oil prices was a major cause of the current recession , and its reversal will be a major factor in recovery .
the other crucial difference is that we know enough not to repeat the errors – particularly trade protectionism – of the 1930 ’s .
scientists continue to surprise us with amazing discoveries , and billions of people around the world have been lifted out of poverty .
but dark clouds have formed on the horizon .
terrorists have struck europe with a vengeance , and millions of refugees fleeing wars and hunger are taxing european institutions , and straining social cohesion .
populist movements have emerged , calling for closed borders and new walls , and their rejection of expertise has led heldin to a “ grim truth ” : that “ we can no longer take it for granted that people believe in science , facts , and knowledge . ”
of course , our expectations will always be in tension with reality .
denver – the agreement on syria ’s chemical weapons reached by russia and the united states is important not so much for what it could mean on the ground – which remains to be seen as inspectors begin to flow into syria and , we hope , chemical-weapons stockpiles begin to be destroyed .
rather , the agreement ’s main significance consists in the fact that it was struck at all : us secretary of state john kerry met with his russian counterpart , sergei lavrov , in geneva , that most traditional of diplomatic venues , and cut a deal on an issue of intense mutual interest .
in the days , weeks , and months ahead , the arrangements to remove chemical weapons from syria will , one hopes , begin a new era in which the us and russia work together on other pressing global issues as well .
a cooperative us-russia relationship is essential if the international system , now almost dysfunctional , is to work properly in the future .
the agreement on syria could accomplish something else : americans might recognize that , lo and behold , there are other ways to solve problems than by dropping bombs .
the benefits of global capitalism are unevenly distributed .
capital is in a much better position than labor because capital is more mobile .
moreover , financial capital is better situated in the global system than industrial capital ; once a plant exists , moving it is difficult .
to be sure , multinational corporations enjoy flexibility in transfer pricing and can exert pressure at the time they make new investment decisions , but their flexibility does n’t compare to the freedom enjoyed by international portfolio investors .
there is also an advantage in being at the center of the global economy rather than at the periphery .
i have long defaulted to watching the five-year forward price for lack of a more fundamentals-based approach to thinking about the equilibrium price of oil .
as i explained in january 2015 , the brent crude oil spot price is less subject to speculative fluctuations , and is thus a purer approximation of underlying commercial supply and demand factors .
the chart i prepared – which was made before the latest oil-price acceleration in early november – shows the five-year forward oil price picking up after a period of some stability .
with the spot price having now moved above the five-year forward price , one could conclude that a trend change is underway .
for my part , i ’m unsure ; but i would n’t be surprised if it happened .
the dpj ’s only reason for being , however , is its anti-ldp stance , while the sdp has long opposed the japan-us security treaty , and the pnp strongly opposes the privatizations of the koizumi era .
that does not amount to a coherent government program , and prime minister yukio hatoyama ’s administration quickly revealed the dpj ’s fundamental hollowness .
but the biggest problem with hatoyama ’s government is that the dpj took power without a coherent national security policy .
this should not have surprised anyone .
the dpj was established in 1998 as a “ jambalaya ” party , consisting of people who had abandoned the ldp , including hatoyama himself , and the former socialist party .
preparation of effective defense of the state is unthinkable without a greater or lesser degree of participation of all the state 's institutions .
in a democratic state these engage in the defense effort only insofar as society understands the importance of defense in the first place .
it is thus necessary to remind ourselves time and again that defending the state means first and foremost defending the human dignity of every one of us .
the new republics of the region , face no concrete or visible enemy at present .
as a result , many consider defense expenditures a luxury , if not an outright waste of money .
more investment could enable scientists to discover new microbial strains with unique abilities to influence soil and crop health locally , thereby leveraging africa ’s own natural environment to improve agricultural productivity .
greater investment in soil research could also have spillover benefits for african economies .
with new discoveries leading to patents and licenses , the resulting research could spur the formation of new agribusinesses and farm-related industries .
i can personally vouch for the power of spillover benefits from this type of research .
my own work on soil microbes at auburn led to the issuance of three us patents , with several agricultural companies pursuing the rights to commercialize products from the technology .
in the american-iranian equation it was the us , not iran , that conducted rigid ideological diplomacy .
iran backed the us during the first gulf war , but was left out of the madrid peace conference .
iran also supported america in its war to depose the taliban in afghanistan .
and , when us forces overran saddam hussein ’s army in the spring of 2003 , the encircled iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table , from the nuclear issue to israel , from hezbollah to hamas .
the iranians also pledged to stop obstructing the israeli-arab peace process .
at the same time , the us has long pursued military superiority .
in 2002 , it unilaterally abrogated the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty .
and , more recently , it has embarked on a massive build-up of conventional forces and a large-scale modernization of its nuclear arsenal .
still , russia , china , and the rest of the world wo n’t allow a return to us hegemony .
putin recently made this clear by unveiling a number of new , cutting-edge strategic weapons systems , as part of what i would call a strategy of “ preemptive deterrence . ”
but in copenhagen , the structure established by the lisbon treaty failed .
beyond the failure in copenhagen , the eu has several other problems .
it tends to be perceived globally as supercilious , petulant , and prim .
its know-it-all attitude grates almost everywhere .
with only 7 % of the world ’s population ( and rapidly dwindling ) and composed mainly of post-industrial low-growth economies , the eu is increasingly seen as marginal .
but larger companies also have a larger ability to become a force for good , both locally and globally .
if a company the size of us retailer walmart decides that it will not allow wasteful packaging , its purchasing power will lead to changes in packaging for the entire retail sector .
the same is true of wages and labor practices .
when the world ’s biggest companies and most well recognized brands take seriously their responsibility as buyers , sellers , and manufacturers and make a firm commitment to act on core values , others tend to follow – or risk being left behind .
those that operate in an ethical manner and seek to improve the lives of all who are associated with the manufacture , marketing , and distribution of their products will benefit from kudos , more business , or simply not being singled out as a bad actor .
simply put , western countries ’ current approach is not working .
this can be seen most clearly in my country , pakistan .
despite massive increases in aid dollars in recent years , including billions authorized by former president barack obama , those of us on the ground are largely cut out of the delivery process .
there are roughly 70 separate local aid offices and 40 international ngos involved in providing aid to pakistanis .
but most decisions about how to spend the money they receive are made outside the country .
the same corruption of purpose is causing the canadian government to guarantee a new pipeline to export output from its polluting and expensive oil sands to asia , while under-investing in canada ’s vast renewable energy sources .
in his meeting with the ceos of major oil and gas companies , francis told them , “ our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the undesired effect of a spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures , harsher environments , and increased levels of poverty . ”
he noted that the oil companies are engaged in “ the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves , whereas the paris agreement clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground . ”
and he reminded the executives that , “ civilization requires energy , but energy use must not destroy civilization ! ”
francis underscored the moral dimension of the problem :
and a nearly identical , invariably lethal disease , kuru , had ravaged the aboriginal people in papua new guinea throughout the twentieth century .
both kuru and scrapie are infectious .
kuru was transmitted through cannibalistic rituals that were commonplace in papua new guinea until the 1950 ’s .
similarly , in the uk and elsewhere , healthy cattle were fed meat and bone meal made from infected cattle .
the resulting epizootic ( animal epidemic ) affected more than 280,000 cows .
this includes those reliant on bank credit , as well as many mortgage holders with very high legacy interest rates and balances that exceed their homes ’ market value .
from every angle , the extremity of this state of affairs – in which those with access to credit do not need it , and those who do can not get it – is highly problematic .
if left unattended , it leads to a gradual , and then accelerated , renewed deleveraging of the economic system , with the highest first-round costs – a longer unemployment and growth crisis – borne disproportionately by those least able to suffer them .
in the next round , as the system slowly implodes , even those with healthy balance sheets would be impacted , accelerating their disengagement from a deleveraging world economy .
all of this slows social mobility , tears already-stretched safety nets , worsens inequality , and accentuates genuine concerns about the functioning and sustainability of today ’s global economic system .
everywhere else , for whatever reason – misguided strategies , tactical mistakes , erroneous theories , us intervention , etc. – they faced only defeat , repression , and futility .
by the early 1990 ’s , it became increasingly evident that the armed struggle for power in latin american was winding down .
only a few groups remained : the shining path in peru , the manuel rodríguez patriotic front in chile , for a brief time the zapatistas in chiapas , mexico , and the farc in colombia .
democratic transitions throughout the hemisphere had made guerrilla warfare unjustifiable : as che foretold in his la guerra de guerrillas in 1962 , wherever the trappings ( or , one might add , the realities ) of democratic rule prevailed , taking up arms was pointless .
in country after country , the guerrillas were defeated , pacified , brought into the democratic process , or rendered irrelevant .
european fascism collapsed with the defeat of germany in 1945 , but less aggressive forms lived on elsewhere , such as argentina with its peronism .
the social base of interwar fascism made it reasonable to see it as a party of the right .
at the time , the working class dependably supported parties of the left .
the only political space left for fascism was the petit bourgeoisie : shopkeepers , small businessmen , and low-level civil servants .
today , the social basis of left-wing politics has vanished .
putting this aside , let us suppose that the decision before tsipras was so crucial and complex that it merited the exceptional step of referendum .
in that case , the event should have reflected that complexity .
it should have been a careful and deliberate sounding out of the will of the people .
it should have been organized and carried out with due respect for the stakes involved , with the government ensuring that adequate information was relayed to the greek people .
instead , greece got a hastily arranged referendum .
in the matter of circumcision , there are obvious tensions not just between religious freedom and individuals ’ physical integrity , but also between parental rights and the authority of the state , multiculturalism and nationalism , and religious and secular moral perspectives .
moreover , different communities prioritize human rights differently .
for some , the moral framework offered by human rights is sufficient in itself ; but for others , as william galston of the brookings institution notes , “ the language of human rights hardly exhausts the realm of moral and spiritual goods . ”
in other words , culture plays a much larger role in shaping interpretations of human rights than many realize , which implies that human-rights practitioners should be wary of passing judgment on any practice with deep cultural or religious roots .
as the cultural psychologist richard shweder notes , circumcision has featured in conflicts between europeans and middle easterners for centuries .
new delhi – there is something about the number five in sino-indian relations .
asia ’s two giants have long defined their relationship in terms of the famous pancha sheela : mutual respect for each other ’s territorial integrity and sovereignty ; mutual non-aggression ; mutual non-interference in each other ’s internal affairs ; equality and mutual benefit ; and peaceful co-existence .
now china ’s new leaders have enunciated a new pancha sheela , with president xi jinping offering a “ five-point proposal ” for sino-indian relations .
the updated principles would maintain strategic communication and healthy bilateral relations ; harness each other ’s strengths and expand cooperation in infrastructure , investment , and other areas ; deepen cultural ties and increase mutual understanding and friendship ; expand coordination and collaboration in multilateral affairs to safeguard developing countries ’ legitimate interests and address global challenges ; and accommodate each other ’s core concerns and reconcile bilateral disagreements amicably .
india would be happy to embrace each of these principles .
for 25 years , the bank tried to get governments out of agriculture , leaving impoverished peasants to fend for themselves .
the result has been a disaster in africa , with farm productivity stagnant for decades .
the bank also pushed for privatization of national health systems , water utilities , and road and power networks , and grossly underfinanced these critical sectors .
this extreme free-market ideology , also called “ structural adjustment , ” went against the practical lessons of development successes in china and the rest of asia .
practical development strategy recognizes that public investments – in agriculture , health , education , and infrastructure – are necessary complements to private investments .
putin ’s authority may appear unshakeable , but it is actually propped up by propaganda and fear .
when the us betrays its own values to avoid challenging russia , it strengthens putin ’s hand considerably .
meanwhile , the perception that he has the us on the ropes enables putin to continue silencing his opponents .
in the run-up to next year ’s presidential election , putin will not hesitate to take advantage of the leeway foreign leaders give him .
already , he has ensured that the opposition leader alexei navalny was convicted of embezzlement , giving the government an excuse to bar him from the ballot .
with energy prices moving center stage , there is a danger that already-weak incentives for investment in low-carbon energy will be further undermined .
across europe , calls for “ affordable energy ” are fast becoming a euphemism for increased fossil-fuel subsidies and a rollback of commitments on green energy .
recent debates in the uk illustrate the emerging fault lines .
five years ago , britain broke the international mold by enacting legislation mandating an 80 % cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 .
today , political leaders openly attack “ burdensome ” green taxes .
indeed , for all practical purposes , pro-market reforms are dead .
a kleptocracy of government officials , their families , and well-connected businessmen has colonized the chinese state and is intent on blocking any reforms that might threaten their privileged status .
moreover , the ccp can no longer count on rising prosperity to sustain public support .
rampant corruption and rising inequality , together with obvious environmental decay , are causing ordinary chinese – especially the middle class , which once had high hopes for reform – to become increasingly disillusioned .
at the same time , given rapid population aging , china ’s demographic dividend has all but dissipated .
apart from another reasonably productive nuclear security summit in seoul in march 2012 , the news on the disarmament front over the last year has certainly been bleak .
further us-russia arms-reduction negotiations ground to a halt long before the american presidential election season began .
meanwhile , no other nuclear-armed state has expressed the slightest interest in bilateral or multilateral reduction negotiations until the two major powers , which currently hold 95 % of the world ’s stockpile , make further major cuts .
cautious initial moves by the us to modify its nuclear doctrine – toward accepting that nuclear weapons ’ “ sole purpose ” is to respond to nuclear threats , and not any other kind – have gone nowhere .
negotiations to “ de-alert ” the 2,000 nuclear weapons that remain at absurdly dangerous , cold war-era launch readiness have never really started .
in the process , he transformed a country that was in the grip of drug barons and on the verge of becoming a failed state .
the professionalism of colombia ’s armed forces , coupled with uribe ’s popularity and a growing economy , has delivered , for the first time in three decades , normality to colombia ’s cities and , increasingly , peace and the rule of law to much of its vast jungle regions . uribe ’s relentlessness has brought on waves of defections from the farc , which is now down to 9,000 guerrillas from a peak of 16,000 in 2001 .
indeed , many farc defectors now prefer to fight for their cause at the ballot box under the new left-wing polo alternativo democratico .
but the benefits of uribe ’s apparent defeat of the farc extend far beyond colombia .
the hostage rescue mission has also forced chávez , still recovering from his failed power-grab referendum of last year ( a moment when chávez ’s own army high command allegedly refused his demand to fudge the result ) onto the defensive .
but the fact remains that a significant share of the world ’s 30 million displaced children – 12 million of whom are refugees – will go through their school-age years without ever having set foot in a school .
across the world ’s 35 conflict zones , 75 million children are currently being denied both education and the prospect of future employment .
obviously , international education aid will have to increase .
yet with a $ 40 billion annual funding gap for primary and secondary education alone , it is also clear that we need a new approach .
in addition to mobilizing private sources of finance , we must make the already available aid ( this year ’s $ 13 billion ) go much further than it has in the past , by creating incentives for recipient governments to increase their own investments in education .
and , indeed , a significant share of greece ’s government debt has migrated from banks to robust public institutions like the european central bank and the international monetary fund .
in that sense , those public institutions have already largely bailed out the private institutions .
but the risks have not been eliminated .
the margin for error for the major banks and other financial institutions is narrow .
because they are still not strongly capitalized , modest losses from direct defaults and indirect losses from companies with business in greece can threaten bank equity , causing bankers to cut back on lending .
for example , it would be useful for programs to monitor how many people with high blood pressure have been diagnosed and placed on treatment , what proportion of those on treatment have achieved blood-pressure control , and what treatment level would be required to reduce premature deaths by the desired target .
finally , the aids effort was able to expand as a result of strong advocacy and collaborations that reshaped markets for diagnostic and treatment programs .
by forecasting medication needs , aggregating orders , and promoting competition , in combination with intense advocacy , policymakers and providers were able to secure market efficiencies .
the resulting economies of scale allowed suppliers to shift from low-volume , high-margin solutions to high-volume , low-margin profit models .
as a result , these efforts reduced the cost of annual hiv treatments from more than $ 10,000 per patient in 2001 to less than $ 100 in 2016 .
just before last year 's trade talks in cancun , the us made some concessions , so that it was no longer the only holdout .
in its bilateral trade agreements , however , the us is demanding what is becoming known as " trips plus , " which would strengthen intellectual property rights further , to ensure that countries only have the right to produce inexpensive generic drugs during epidemics and other emergencies .
the global consensus , reflected in the commission report , calls for more exceptions , so that , say , drugs can be made available in any case where to do so could save a life .
to those confronting the prospect of death , what matters is access to life-saving drugs , not whether what is killing the person is part of an epidemic .
bilateral agreements form the basis of enhanced ties of friendship between countries .
in the meantime , the rate of spending growth in china will not change dramatically .
as a result , chinese policymakers have been waiting to see whether the recovery in the us is real .
if it is , china ’s exports will grow more rapidly .
and if its exports grow more rapidly , they can allow the renminbi to rise .
without that exchange-rate adjustment , faster export growth would expose the chinese economy to the risk of overheating .
when i joined the imf in the early 1980s , discussions with non-government counterparts , whether on country or policy work , were discouraged .
the situation today is very different .
broader national engagement – with ngos , local media , and a broad set of politicians – is now viewed as an integral part of effective country advice and program implementation , as well as being essential for the fund ’s “ surveillance ” function under its article of agreements .
a similar pivot is needed if the imf is to deliver better on the supra-national issues that are now migrating up its policy agenda .
specifically , the fund would need to complement its traditional core constituency of governments and other multilateral institutions ( particularly the world bank ) with systemically influential sub-national and private counterparts .
once slow to respond , the world is now acting .
thirty countries have recently signed up to the lucens or safe school guidelines , which instruct their military authorities how to prevent schools from being used as instruments of war .
leila zerrougui , special representative of the un secretary-general for children and armed conflict , recommends designating abductions of children from schools a “ trigger violation ” for the naming of terrorist organizations in the secretary-general ’s annual report to the security council .
and , thanks to the united nations children ’s fund ( unicef ) , the global coalition to protect education from attack , the global business coalition for education , and former nigerian finance minister ngozi okonjo-iweala , nigeria has now piloted the concept of safe schools .
this has meant funding school guards , fortifications , and surveillance equipment to reassure parents and pupils that everything possible is being done to ensure their school is safe to attend .
this is why greece is insolvent and a coercive restructuring of its public debt is inevitable .
it is why spain and ireland are in serious trouble , and why even italy – which is on relatively sounder fiscal footing , but has had flat per capita income for a decade and little structural reform – can not be complacent .
as fiscal austerity means more recessionary and deflationary pressures in the short run , one would need more monetary stimulus to compensate and more domestic demand growth – via delayed fiscal austerity – in germany .
but the two biggest policy players in the eurozone – the european central bank and the german government – want no part of that agenda , hoping that a quarter of good gdp data makes a trend .
the rest of the eurozone is in barely better shape than the periphery : the bond vigilantes may not have woken up in france , but economic performance there has been anemic at best – driven mostly by a mini housing boom .
europe was thought by the french political class to be the solution .
but europe and the euro could are increasingly catalysts for public resentment .
jospin and chirac have done nothing to implement the large liberalization program ( including energy , financial services and transport ) agreed among eu members in lisbon two years ago , which means that the benefits of liberalization are denied france at a time when the public perceives the eu as imposing all sorts of restrictions on the french way of doing business .
it is time for france to abandon the indulgence of french exceptionalism ( ' l'exception francaise ) and start serious reforms that engage the french electorate .
the shame of le pen 's newfound prominence may yet prove beneficial if it forces the mainstream political establishment to heed popular concerns and address the country 's problems .
people in places like france and poland who worry about national decline seek to blame somebody outside the country .
there was certainly a great deal of this type of sentiment in the 1930 ’s , when the populist response to the great depression attributed it to the sinister forces of “ international capital . ”
the modern version of this explanation holds that the world is changing so quickly that national security and , indeed , national identity , are under threat .
an alternative scenario suggests that these fears emanate from a real problem .
modern economic growth still depends in almost every advanced industrial country on imported energy ( norway is an exception ) .
his other name , abu mazen , is not a revolutionary name but reflects the practice of naming a person as the father of his eldest son .
abbas ’s son , mazen , runs a local advertising agency .
in his attempt to counter arafat ’s political corruption and micromanagement , abbas lost whatever chance he had to maintain the loyalty of the fatah leadership , newly appointed pa officials , security personnel , and , most importantly , local militants .
calling for national elections , while politically correct , was political suicide , for he lacked any idea of the possible outcome and did very little to ensure the discipline of fatah .
an attempt at a primary to choose fatah candidates backfired , owing to fraud and the losers ’ refusal to honor the results .
new york – for four decades , ledra street in the heart of nicosia had been a symbol of a divided cyprus .
and then , two years ago this april , the wall that split the capital into north and south was opened .
slowly , people who had not mingled for 44 years began to renew their ties and rediscover one another .
it was a window onto what the future might bring .
last week , i visited the ledra street crossing .
but if the proposals discussed in beijing last month are realized , the resulting fta could surpass nafta in its degree of integration and importance to the world economy .
in addition , the formation of a china-japan-south korea fta would most likely trigger a chain-reaction .
for example , the momentum could expand southward and stimulate asean , which has bilateral ftas with all three countries , to join the group .
such a turn of events would be equivalent to establishing the east asia free trade area , which the asean +3 envisioned about a decade ago .
if that happened , other countries – australia , new zealand , and , most importantly , india – might seek to jump on the bandwagon .
compare this with antibiotic treatment of , say , a urogenital infection , which lasts a few weeks at most .
as a result , compliance with tb drug treatment is particularly weak , paving the way for the emergence of multidrug-resistant ( mdr ) tb , which can no longer be treated by conventional therapeutic regimes .
some 50 million people are infected with tubercle bacilli that are mdr .
while treating mdr-tb remains possible , doing so is arduous , with a treatment time of roughly two years , using drugs that are neither as efficient nor as benign as canonical drugs – and at a cost that rises by a factor of 10-100 .
while this additional cost can be borne by health-care systems in the rich world , it is excessive for poor countries , implying no , or insufficient , treatment .
market forces , of course , play a role , too , but markets are shaped by politics ; and , in america , with its quasi-corrupt system of campaign finance and its revolving doors between government and industry , politics is shaped by money .
for example , a bankruptcy law that privileges derivatives over all else , but does not allow the discharge of student debt , no matter how inadequate the education provided , enriches bankers and impoverishes many at the bottom .
in a country where money trumps democracy , such legislation has become predictably frequent .
but growing inequality is not inevitable .
there are market economies that are doing better , both in terms of both gdp growth and rising living standards for most citizens .
by contrast , former secretary of state and democratic candidate hillary clinton and a leading republican contender , donald trump , have opposed reform of social security and medicare .
senator bernie sanders , clinton ’s democratic rival , actually proposes to expand the programs ’ unfunded liabilities .
with so few presidential candidates recognizing the link between reforming social security and medicare and ensuring broadly shared prosperity , the us faces serious risks .
the progressive redistributive agenda could continue to advance , or the conservative entitlement-reform agenda could fail .
either way , the us would face growth-limiting tax increases and limits on the contributions that public investment can make to the country ’s future .
the austrians are right that haider-like parties exist in many european countries – in britain , france , even in some scandinavian countries .
but in all these countries , the political discourse of all democratic parties ostracized these racist groups and parties : british conservatives have never entered into an alliance with the british national front ; the same goes for france , where french conservatives have expelled from their own party local leaders who fashioned municipal alliances with le pen 's representatives .
this is exactly what the austrian conservative people 's party under wolfgang schuessel did not do .
confronted with an election outcome of whether to rejoin the social democrats or haider 's freedom party , they made a faustian pact with haider .
there may be good political reasons why another alliance with the social democrats was not appealing to schuessel 's party ( for one , he would not be chancellor in such a coalition ) .
the congressional budget office projects that even with no further legislation , the debt ratio will rise to 91.2 % by 2027 .
the direct effect of the $ 1.5 trillion deficit implied by the tax reform would be to raise that to 97 % .
a military emergency or an economic downturn would call for additional debt-financed spending or tax reductions .
but even a massive spending program like the $ 900 billion american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 would add only an additional three percentage points to the debt ratio .
it is hard to believe that a debt ratio of 97 % would make that more difficult to achieve than a debt ratio of 92 % .
the economic community of west african states ( ecowas ) strongly condemned any attempt to “ usurp the popular will of the people of côte d’ivoire and appeals to all stakeholders to accept the results declared by the electoral commission . ”
ecowas chair and nigerian president goodluck jonathan called on all parties to “ respect and fully implement the verdict of the ivorian people as declared by the independent electoral commission . ”
and us president barack obama congratulated ouattara , and said that the world would “ hold those who act to thwart the democratic process and the will of the electorate accountable for their actions . ”
the african union also responded promptly .
its peace and security council met and expressed the au ’s categorical rejection of any attempt to create a fait accompli that undermines the electoral process .
seoul – has the world entered a new era of chaos ?
america ’s vacillating policy toward syria certainly suggests so .
indeed , the bitter legacy of the invasions of iraq and afghanistan , followed by the 2008 financial crisis , has made the united states not only reluctant to use its military might , even when “ red lines ” are crossed , but also seemingly unwilling to bear any serious burden to maintain its global leadership position .
but , if america is no longer willing to lead , who will take its place ?
china ’s leaders have demonstrated their lack of interest in active global leadership by openly rejecting calls to become a “ responsible stakeholder ” in the international political and economic systems .
ethanol accounts for more than 50 % of current light-vehicle fuel demand in the country , and petrobras – brazil ’s energy giant and one of the largest companies in latin america – expects this share to increase to more than 80 % by 2020 .
our research shows that industrial policy was successful in promoting a competitive bioethanol industry in brazil .
a massive stimulus package , prompted by the 1970 ’s rise in oil prices , gave rise to an entirely new industry .
but it would not have worked without the crucial role played by competition .
brazil was attempting to become energy self-sufficient in a manner similar to modern efforts by other countries .
indian fathers still sometimes repay debts by committing their children to bonded labor .
pakistani parents occasionally maim their children to make them beguiling beggars .
sadly , families are often the last to protest exploitation of their children .
the ilo contends that children suffer greatly when they are forced to perform as " small adults . "
" the child 's creativeness and ability to transcend reality are blunted , " states one ilo report , " and his whole mental world is impoverished . "
but despite its wealth and military might , america 's ability to project political power - for good or ill - will decline in future years , for at least five reasons : america 's budget is in crisis .
thanks to bush 's tax cuts and military spending , which have contributed to budget deficits of $ 500 billion per year , the us will have to raise taxes and limit budget spending , whether or not bush is re-elected .
the annual military budget , which has increased by $ 150 billion since bush took office , will need to be cut in coming years to get the budget under control ; the us is borrowing massively from abroad .
asia 's central banks have bought hundreds of billions of dollars of us securities .
japan alone has foreign exchange reserves of around $ 750 billion , much of that in us treasury bills .
so far , though , there have not been any globally devastating monetary attacks outside the realm of cinematic fantasy .
of course , there have long been political efforts to undermine or replace the dollar as the dominant global currency .
the most seductive alternative seems to have been gold .
russian theorists of “ eurasia ” often tout traditional russian iconography ’s use of the fine metal .
in 2001 , then-malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad tried to introduce a “ gold dinar ” as an answer to the us-based currency system .
my profit for correctly taking this bearish view is therefore € 1.65 m – the € 9.1 m i got by selling the bonds when i borrowed them on january 1 , minus the € 7.2 m that i had to pay to repurchase them on june 30 , minus the € 250,000 in interest that i had to pay goldman sachs for the six-month loan .
voilà – a successful “ short ” trade .
of course , a single short seller can not “ make ” the price of an asset ( unless he is george soros , whose famous bet against the british pound in 1992 made him a billionaire and forced britain out of the european exchange-rate mechanism ) .
but if a bunch of speculators decide ( rightly or wrongly ) that a government ’s debt is overpriced , they can force down its price , thereby forcing up its yield ( the interest rate that the government must pay ) .
if the attack persists , speculators can force a government to default on its debt , unless it can find a way to finance its borrowing more cheaply .
to the extent that tariffs reduce china ’s exports , the government and central bank can offset the economic impact by stimulating domestic demand .
the slowdown in chinese economic growth this year has been due almost entirely to deliberate decisions to deleverage the banking system , cut local governments ’ borrowing , reduce over-investment in infrastructure , and curb booming house prices by tightening monetary policy .
all of these austerity policies can easily be softened or reversed .
doubts about the chinese government ’s willingness to shift economic policy from tightening to stimulus have been dispelled in the past few weeks .
clear statements from policymakers , all the way up to xi , have indicated that china will not permit any further weakening of the economy next year , even if that means accepting bigger budget deficits or easing up on bank deleveraging and monetary tightening .
this was the age of the village blacksmith , weaver , potter , and cobbler .
in the eighteenth century , shipping technology improved enough to allow the creation of global supply chains .
cotton was one of the first industries to witness this shift .
slaves from africa were used to grow cotton in the southern united states , which was then shipped to english mills .
the finished cloth was then exported to the rest of the world .
is it to be " always represented " by a lone political party ?
i do not know what " the progressive direction of advanced culture " is , but advanced culture played no part in the ccp-inspired " wipe out poisonous weeds campaign , " the " anti-rightist movement , " or the " eliminate demons and evil heresy campaign . "
such obscurantism only creates a culture of stultifying uniformity .
like a blade of grass beneath a stone , culture knows how and in which direction to seek light .
it does not need to be " represented . "
in 2006 , president olusegun obasanjo , then nigeria ’s president , was among the first to do so .
uganda ’s president yoweri museveni followed suit when signing the anti-gay bill into law in 2014 .
other leaders , from gambia ’s president yahya jammeh to zimbabwe ’s robert mugabe , have spoken in the same vein .
these official attitudes have caused significant suffering for africa ’s gays and lesbians .
indeed , the price of homophobia for gay people in many african countries is painfully clear : legal penalties , social ostracism , and mob justice .
still , it appears that china ’s share , at around 30 % , will be the largest of the 57 participating countries , which could effectively give it a near-veto over aiib decisions .
that underscores the main concern among development economists and observers of international relations as the aiib ’s birth approaches .
will it turn out to be a bank of china , by china , and for china , or will it pursue a multilateral agenda in the manner of the world bank and regional development banks like the asian development bank ( adb ) and africa development bank ( afdb ) ?
china ’s explanation for its push to establish the aiib is that developing countries have inadequate access to capital for infrastructure .
perhaps more important , they have an insufficient voice in the world bank , the international monetary fund , and the adb .
at the international monetary fund ’s annual meeting in october , the fund ’s chief economist , olivier blanchard fueled the controversy by pointing out that in recent times governments have tended to underestimate the adverse growth consequences of fiscal consolidation .
they have typically assumed that to cut public spending by a dollar would reduce gdp by 50 cents in the short term ; according to blanchard , the true outcome in current conditions is a decline by between $ 0.90-1.70 .
that is a big gap , but also a perplexing finding : how can there be so much uncertainty ?
contrary to what such forecasting disparities may suggest , economists actually know a lot about the consequences of fiscal policy , at least much more than they used to know .
until the 1980 ’s , it was routinely assumed that the so-called “ multiplier ” – the ratio of change in gdp to the change in government spending – was stable and larger than one .
worse , there have been suggestions of their actual use .
military planners who consider the use of nuclear weapons have probably given scant thought to those living in the cities on their target lists .
for too long , the residents of cities have been used as pawns on a global nuclear chessboard , with little concern for the full implications of playing the game .
but , as the public is educated about the specific threats that nuclear weapons continue to pose to the cities in which they live , that stance will be increasingly difficult to maintain .
at the same time , people worldwide must stop regarding one another as untrustworthy enemies .
these groups have been able to capitalize on the economic and social pain felt in many eu member states , especially given that the majority of europeans are unconvinced that the worst is over .
moreover , right-wing populist parties took advantage of growing public frustration with the eu itself .
many european citizens oppose the idea of “ more europe , ” the mantra of eu traditionalists in the two major party families , the european people ’s party ( epp ) and the social democrats .
the influence of widening disparities between the eu ’s affluent “ north ” and the stumbling “ south , ” with france in the middle ( but heading south ) , was also evident .
and the massive prosperity gap between “ old ” and “ new ” eu member states continues to determine voting patterns .
they raise their glasses , filled with the finest scotch , which has been sprinkled with a fine powder .
not gold powder , as lesser moguls might offer , nor even the purest cocaine .
no , this is far rarer and costlier : it is pulverized white rhino horn .
a half-century ago , white rhinos abounded in africa .
today , the international union for the conservation of nature estimates that only 25,000 still roam the continent , mostly in south africa , with a handful in namibia and kenya .
dubai – the global financial crisis taught the world how profoundly interdependent our economies have become .
in today ’s crisis of extremism , we must recognize that we are just as interdependent for our security , as is clear in the current struggle to defeat isis .
if we are to prevent isis from teaching us this lesson the hard way , we must acknowledge that we can not extinguish the fires of fanaticism by force alone .
the world must unite behind a holistic drive to discredit the ideology that gives extremists their power , and to restore hope and dignity to those whom they would recruit .
isis certainly can – and will – be defeated militarily by the international coalition that is now assembling and which the uae is actively supporting .
this year 's nobel prize in economic sciences went to george akerlof of the university of california at berkeley , michael spence of stanford university , and myself for our work on `` asymmetry of information . ''
what is that work about and why did we undertake it ?
for two hundred years , economists used simple economic models that assumed that information was perfect - i.e. that all participants have equal and transparent knowledge of the relevant factors .
they knew that information was n't perfect , but hoped that a world with moderate imperfections of information would be akin to a world with perfect information .
we showed that this notion was ill-founded : even small imperfections of information could have profound effects on how the economy behaved .
the bankers ’ pursuit of self-interest ( greed ) did not lead to the well-being of society ; it did not even serve their shareholders and bondholders well .
it certainly did not serve homeowners who are losing their homes , workers who have lost their jobs , retirees who have seen their retirement funds vanish , or taxpayers who paid hundreds of billions to bail out the banks .
under the threat of a collapse of the entire system , the safety net – intended to help unfortunate individuals meet the exigencies of life – was generously extended to commercial banks , then to investment banks , insurance firms , auto companies , even car-loan companies .
never has so much money been transferred from so many to so few .
we are accustomed to thinking of government transferring money from the well off to the poor .
the practical result – ukraine remaining unaligned in military and security terms – would reflect the will of the ukrainian population as a whole .
this approach would be consistent with the principle , which us president barack obama highlighted when announcing the latest round of sanctions against russia last month , that ukraine must be permitted to “ chart its own path . ”
above all , it would help the people of ukraine – divided between inherently antagonistic identities – to live together peacefully .
of course , ukraine ’s position may change in the future , with cultural , demographic , and economic shifts producing the needed consensus to abandon neutrality .
what is important is that the constitution requires a super-majority – rather than , say , the easily reversible “ non-bloc ” resolution that the ukrainian parliament adopted in 2010 – to join a military alliance .
in coming years the most important fiscal task facing east european and nis government will be to reduce the size of social spending to a more reasonable portion of gdp .
political elites -- at home and from abroad -- will have to focus public attention on the looming fiscal crisis .
the public should understand the crucial difference between a one-time transfer to old workers at the start of market reform , and a long run pension policy .
in any viable long term arrangement , the level of benefits relative to wages should be reduced , retirement ages should be raised to international norms , and eligibility for special pensions ( disability ones in particular ) should be tightened to cover only the truly in need .
in institutional terms , long-term reform should aim for a shift to a pension system based on individual savings accounts , as in chile , as opposed to the current state run , pay-as-you-go pension systems .
but that may well be followed by a second stage in which tight labor markets , populist nationalism , and industry concentration begin to offset the one-time structural effects of new technologies being widely adopted .
and in a third stage , the possible onset of higher inflation may catch policymakers and investors by surprise , producing excessive reactions that make a bad situation worse .
as with most paradigm shifts , there can be little certainty regarding the timing of this scenario .
but , either way , policymakers in advanced economies must recognize that their inflation outlook is subject to a wider range of dynamic possibilities than they have considered so far .
focusing too much on the cyclical , rather than the structural , could pose serious risks to future economic wellbeing and financial stability .
the same goes for implementing the 2015 paris climate agreement , which will require ample investments in energy efficiency and renewable-energy sources to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2º celsius .
the un ’s manifold agendas – peace and security , sustainable development , human rights , and humanitarianism – must be structurally integrated into one strategic continuum , rather than remaining rigid , self-contained institutional silos .
multidisciplinary “ team un ” groups could be deployed in the field to break down departmental barriers and confront appropriate challenges .
the groups would operate under a common mandate across all un agencies , and be led by un operations directors in each country .
a fifth step should be to integrate women fully and equally into all parts of the un agenda , not just in discrete areas pertaining to “ women ’s ” issues .
with an estimated 268 million people in extreme poverty in the latest survey from 2011 , india is home to the largest absolute number of poor people on the planet .
each is on average 38 cents a day below the extreme poverty line .
for india , the cost adds up to almost $ 11 billion exchange-rate dollars .
the most expensive countries in which to end poverty would be the democratic republic of congo and nigeria .
in the drc , 77 % of the population is extremely poor and falls a dollar short of the poverty line , on average .
in recent decades , however , macroeconomic policy in most developing countries has become more pro-cyclical , largely exacerbating the volatility of international financial markets and commodity prices .
pro-cyclical fiscal adjustment tends to encourage a short-term orientation towards economic policy , which limits long-term investments in infrastructure and human capital , thus constraining growth .
more fiscal space can be created by improving governance and strengthening the tax base , and , for the poorest countries , by achieving additional stable official development assistance ( oda ) channeled through national budgets .
indeed , when oda is not determined by geopolitics , it can have a strong positive effect on long-term growth , essentially because it supports investment in infrastructure and human development .
finally , institutional reform encompasses more than creating markets and guaranteeing property rights .
european leaders need to get serious about europe ’s cocaine problem .
the “ white lady ” is seducing a steadily growing number of europeans , and remaining in a state of denial will only worsen the consequences .
cocaine used to be america ’s problem , to the point that the united states started a major campaign against sellers and consumers of crack cocaine in the inner cities , drug traffickers , and suppliers in the andes .
but now demand for cocaine in most of the world is stable or dropping .
coca cultivation has been slashed by a quarter in the past five years , and seizures of cocaine have almost doubled .
berkeley – it has been one year since donald trump was elected president of the united states , and america ’s democratic institutions are clearly under strain .
a mere 20 % of americans now trust the federal government to “ do the right thing , ” while trust in congress has fallen below 9 % .
among congressional republicans , in particular , a “ take-no-prisoners ” extremism is undermining the federal government ’s capacity for action , which is precisely what many on the far right want .
according to some pessimists , the us constitution was not designed to address the challenges of a country so sharply divided by income , race , and partisanship .
yet state and local governments are still trusted by most voters , and they have the power under the tenth amendment of the us constitution to strengthen democratic institutions .
the european parliament has consistently denounced belarus as europe ’s last dictatorship , yet eu member governments continue business as usual with aleksander lukashenka , the country ’s wayward and near lunatic despot .
this is especially true when there is a chance to save or make money .
for example , for more than a decade , germany ’s police forces , customs service , and even the bundeswehr have been ordering uniforms from a state-owned factory in the city of dzherzinsky , named after the father of the red terror and founder of the soviet kgb , feliks dzherzinsky .
similar examples of such indifferent cynicism abound .
by treating lukashenka as a favored business partner at the same time that the eu is trying to isolate him as an international pariah , european hypocrisy stands naked .
bond yields in southern europe were rising , and a pervasive sense of apprehension and fear cloaked governments in european capitals .
but political leadership was sorely lacking .
finally , in december , decisive action was taken .
there would be a “ fiscal treaty , ” which would reinforce the stability and growth pact and , importantly , entail automatic sanctions to ensure that eurozone members stick to those rules .
at the same time , the european central bank unleashed its € 1 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) long-term refinancing operation , which pulled the european banking system back from the brink .
an analysis by ronald gilson , henry hansmann , and mariana pargendler of brazil ’s novo mercado – the stock exchange ’s special voluntary listing segment , which provides strong protections for investors in newly listed companies – supports this view .
but stock exchanges have limits , particularly in brazil .
in the absence of reliable courts , they can not sue to enforce their rules .
their only recourse is to push recalcitrant firms off the exchange .
the novo mercado dealt with this problem by subjecting disputes involving its newly-listed companies to arbitration .
new york – january is traditionally a time for assessing the developments of the previous year , in order to anticipate what the new one has in store .
unfortunately , even though we may be at a turning point for the better politically , the data that have emerged in the last month do not paint a promising picture of the global economy ’s short-term prospects .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
but , again , this contradicts traditional trade dynamics , in which one country ’s success does not imply hardship for another .
in theory , of course , a simultaneous shift in several countries toward stem-focused secondary and higher education – with large concomitant productivity gains – could diminish the competitiveness of an economy that made no such effort .
but this scenario is highly unlikely , at least in the foreseeable future .
in fact , the proliferation of highly specialized universities in europe has failed to buttress economic growth or employment .
and the conversion of comprehensive universities into specialized institutes for science and technology in the soviet union and communist china did nothing to avert economic disaster in those economies .
first , all were caused by a profound crisis of the social-welfare state : falling output , rising unemployment , large budget deficits , inflation , and devaluation .
without severe crisis , no significant reform was likely .
second , a change of government through elections prompted reforms and gave them democratic legitimacy .
reform does not require a state of emergency , as is often argued .
third , reforms require a strong leader .
indeed , with profitability at or near record levels , cash holdings by the corporate sector in the united states have piled up quarter after quarter , reaching all-time highs – and earning very little at today ’s near-zero interest rates .
moreover , because companies have significantly improved their operating efficiency and lengthened the maturities on their debt , they need a lot less precautionary savings than they did in the past .
however one looks at it , the corporate sector in advanced economies in general , and in the us in particular , is as strong as it has been in many years .
non-financial firms have achieved a mix of resilience and agility that contrasts sharply with prevailing conditions for some households and governments around the world that have yet to confront adequately a legacy of over-leverage .
but , rather than deploy their abundant cash in new investments to expand capacity and tap new markets – which they have been very hesitant to do since the global financial crisis erupted – many companies have so far preferred ( or have been pressured by activist investors ) to give it back to shareholders .
purely from the standpoint of economic potential and fundamentals , the case is far stronger for south korea , a sophisticated economic power whose primary liability is the danger that the regime of its evil twin to the north will collapse and inundate it with hungry refugees .
the same is true of turkey , with its robust banking sector , thriving domestic market , growing importance to middle east and energy politics , nato membership , european union membership bid , and ties to ethnic cousins across central asia .
perhaps the most compelling case of all is that of indonesia , the world ’s largest muslim state , with a rapidly expanding middle class , relatively stable democratic politics , and an economy that has been a star performer in asia despite the global recession .
from an american perspective , indonesia is an attractive alternative to russia , which recently has vied with venezuela for leadership of the “ america in decline ” cheering section .
indonesia , moreover , has shown resilience not only economically , but also as a nation .
a good example is the allegation that the “ responsibility to protect ” principle is inherently flawed , because the major powers will always be immune from intervention , not only because five of them can exercise a security council veto , but also because of their inherent military strength .
but this ignores the principle that no military intervention will ever be legitimate unless it satisfies , among other criteria , the test of diminishing , not augmenting , human suffering . and going to war against any of the major powers to protect a suffering minority would certainly trigger a much wider conflagration .
the bottom line is that values matter in international relations , and states that place great emphasis on the promotion of values are extremely vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy .
no state that aspires to win the support or cooperation of others can afford to be seen to be comfortable with unambiguous double standards .
and worst of all is to be perceived as being soft on those who , like egypt ’s current military rulers , commit mass-atrocity crimes against their own citizens .
the ssez ’s recent denial that any company operating there had been fined by the us reinforces the suspicion that hun sen ’s government will continue to turn a blind eye .
this might be good for a corrupt few , but it is bad for cambodia .
already , the country ’s deteriorating record on democracy and human rights is threatening its tariff-free access to the european union market , provided through the bloc ’s “ everything but arms ” trade regime .
the last thing cambodia needs is also to risk economic reprisal for helping chinese firms to dodge us tariffs .
yet that seems to be exactly what hun sen ’s government plans to do .
some important economies are still fighting deflation .
more than 200 million people are unemployed .
the global economy risks getting stuck in a “ new mediocre ” – a prolonged period of slow growth and feeble job creation .
to break free from stagnation , we need renewed policy momentum .
if the measures agreed by the leaders assembled at the g-20 in november are implemented , they will lift world gdp by more than 2 % by 2018 – the equivalent of adding $ 2 trillion in global income .
should it undergo further simultaneous transformation and enlargement ?
what kind of relations should nato have with its partners ?
the albright report tries to address these questions in a balanced way .
it endorses policies that capture accurately the relationship between “ out of area operations ” and members ’ commitment to their mutual self-defense under article 5 of the north atlantic treaty .
it further rightly suggests that nato ’s strategic political and military objectives could be achieved jointly with russia through greater stability , mutual transparency , predictability , and arms reduction verified by non-proliferation and arms control agreements .
one is north korea , whose recent behavior has been clever and deceptive .
the north koreans have violated their agreements , knowing that china , the country with the greatest potential leverage , is most concerned about regime collapse in north korea , and thus the threat of chaos on its borders .
japan officially endorses the objective of a non-nuclear world , but it relies on america ’s extended nuclear deterrent , and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear blackmail from north korea ( or china ) .
the japanese fear that the credibility of american extended deterrence will be weakened if the us decreases its nuclear forces to parity with china .
it is a mistake , however , to believe that extended deterrence depends on parity in numbers of nuclear weapons .
berkeley – back in the late 1990 ’s , in america at least , two schools of thought pushed for more financial deregulation – that is , for repealing the legal separation of investment banking from commercial banking , relaxing banks ’ capital requirements , and encouraging more aggressive creation and use of derivatives .
if deregulation looks like such a bad idea now , why did n’t it then ?
the first school of thought , broadly that of the united states ’ republican party , was that financial regulation was bad because all regulation was bad .
the second , broadly that of the democratic party , was somewhat more complicated , and was based on four observations :
· in the global economy ’s industrial core , at least , it had then been more than 60 years since financial disruption had had more than a minor impact on overall levels of production and employment .
it is grotesque that so many people who stand to benefit from such “ socialist ” policies are still persuaded to vote against them because they are supposedly “ un-american . ”
concentrating on egalitarianism would appeal to liberals , of course , but it should not alienate moderate voters either , because more equality would be good for the economy .
and it might even persuade some angry , poor trump supporters to recognize that his pseudo-populism is not about helping the left-behind folks in rust belt cities and rural hinterlands .
it is about giving even more money to the very few .
the democrats ’ core message for the next two years should be that in a plutocracy , everyone else loses .
but neither wants to be the “ chicken , ” because that would undermine their domestic political standing and empower the other side .
still , without a deal by year ’s end , a collision will become likely .
as the clock ticks down , a bad outcome becomes more likely .
similarly , trump thought he could bully iran by abandoning the joint comprehensive plan of action and imposing severe sanctions .
but the iranians have responded by escalating their regional provocations , knowing full well that trump can not afford a full-scale war and the oil-price spike that would result from it .
but the scaf now seems to have realized that , in a leaderless situation , no civilian politician can grant immunity without becoming vulnerable to attack by rivals .
moreover , the scaf has carefully weighed the politicians and dissected their relative weakness , limited capacity , notorious opportunism , and general inconsistency .
as a result , there is a growing belief within the scaf that its three “ minimum ” demands have become both unnecessary and insufficient .
in the last two months , the scaf ’s behavior towards civilian politicians , civil-society actors , and , more recently , the coptic community , has clearly reflected the change in attitude : “ you need immunity , guidance , and protection from us – not us from you . ”
the political polarization , sectarian incidents , weak economy , and absence of security have dimmed egypt ’s prospects for a successful democratic transition .
higher debt-service costs require higher tax rates , which in turn weaken incentives and reduce economic growth .
by the end of the decade , the us will have to pay an amount equivalent to more than one-third of the revenue from personal-income taxes just to pay the interest on the national debt .
foreign investors now hold more than half of that debt .
paying interest to them requires sending more goods and services to the rest of the world than the us receives from the rest of the world .
that requires a weaker dollar to make us goods more attractive to foreign buyers and to make foreign goods more expensive to american consumers .
indeed , aside from matters of domestic policy and the issue of internal freedom , the choice between the major candidates hinges on the question of whether iran should seek greater international integration .
ahmadinejad stands for a policy of confrontation and partial isolation ; moussavi stands for more openness .
a policy of opening the country would therefore quickly put the regime ’s existence at risk .
if ahmadinejad prevails , the dilemma for the west will be that it will have to deal with a regime discredited by election fraud , but still indispensable for resolving almost all of the middle east ’s important problems : iran ’s own nuclear program and the conflicts in afghanistan , pakistan , iraq , lebanon , and palestine .
iran is also a key player in cooling the hot spots in the caucasus and central asia .
perhaps the most visible gains were on the external front .
exports jumped from 5 % to 30 % of gdp , and the gdp share of inward foreign direct investment tripled .
but where it counts – in overall productivity and economic growth – the story is one of substantial disappointment .
since 1996 , per capita economic growth has averaged well below 1.5 % , and total factor productivity has stagnated or declined .
if ever there was a country that was destined to be the poster child of the new orthodoxy in economic development , it was mexico .
after all , many asian countries have achieved impressive export-led growth under the current system .
and bilateral or regional trade deals can chip away at some of the barriers in the current global system .
for example , a fundamental problem is that the nature of global trade is constantly evolving , and existing agreements have only limited capacity to adapt .
services like education , banking , accounting , and insurance account for an ever larger share of global output ( now roughly two-thirds ) , and further expansion requires significant changes in existing agreements .
even if asia has succeeded by relentlessly exporting manufactures , today ’s poorest countries , especially in africa , can realistically export only agriculture and textiles .
a contemporary non-medical writer described the qualities of intense pain as including extreme unpleasantness , an ability to annihilate complex thoughts and other feelings , an ability to destroy language , and a strong resistance to objectification .
she reminds physicians that , for the person suffering intense pain , what dominates awareness above all else is a powerful negative emotion .
most of the time , pain occurs after simple nerve endings detect tissue injury in various ways and generate signals that travel to the spinal cord and from there to the brain .
for many years , scientists thought that these signals traveled along a few well-defined routes to reach a relay station in the brain called the thalamus .
from there , scientists believed , the signals went on to the part of the brain 's cortex that managed body awareness , and somehow the cortex turned them into conscious experience .
when capital flight forced françois mitterrand to abort his program in 1983 , france ’s socialists performed an abrupt volte-face and embraced financial liberalization on a global scale .
according to harvard business school ’s rawi abdelal , this was the key event that set in motion the developments that would ultimately enshrine freedom of capital movement as a global norm .
the first stop was the european union in the late 1980 ’s , where two french socialists – jacques delors and pascal lamy ( the president of the european commission and his assistant , respectively ) – led the way .
then it was the turn of the organization of economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) .
eventually , the imf joined the bandwagon under michel camdessus , another frenchmen who had served as governor of the bank of france under mitterrand .
within 15 minutes of the general ’s face fading from the screen , 40 army units in algeria declared their loyalty .
the men at the barricades were persuaded to leave their stronghold ; the insurrectionary leaders were either detained or escaped to spain .
the defeat of the military revolt was the first time that the republican authority of paris had been asserted over the pieds noirs who had helped to bring down the fourth republic .
de gaulle ’s firmness and rhetoric – aided , it must be said , by the fumbling of the rebels – established the primacy of the state .
the next day , de gaulle ’s face was drawn , but he was resolute and full of energy .
the diplomatic promotion of palestine offered him a lifeline .
did the israelis really want a resurgence of islamist violence in gaza , the potential collapse of peaceful politics on the west bank , and now the right of a recognized palestinian state to take israel to the international criminal court for war crimes ?
if not , why are they so ham-fisted ?
it appears that israel is making the same mistake that others have made in the past .
it has been proven repeatedly that military intimidation of civilians does not break their morale and turn them against their own leaders , however terrible the regime .
fourth , the war in afghanistan has not only proceeded rapidly on the ground , but has led to a diplomatic breakthrough as well .
the un will play a central role in the reconstruction of a working government in that country , and in coordinating humanitarian assistance for the afghan people .
the growing role of the un in this process puts the seal of international law and diplomacy over the global struggle against terrorism , and helps to reassure many countries that this is a true international effort , not just the us acting alone .
while these seem to be a grab-bag of achievements , they point to a single message : the world community is finding new ways to cooperate , even against a backdrop of terrorism and global recession .
the growing role of international institutions under the un umbrella provides greater confidence that disputes can be addressed peacefully and even sensibly , with significant inputs of scientific expertise as in the climate change treaty .
except for barely practical political rhetoric from leaders like hugo chávez in venezuela and evo morales in bolivia , there is nothing new on offer in the world ’s electoral marketplace that differs very much from what is usually called neo-liberalism or the washington consensus .
in other words , there is no longer a battle between different projects in any modern country , no left-right confrontation ( with their nuances ) that might raise voters ’ emotions .
here , brazil is no different than the united kingdom , spain or uruguay .
indeed , brazil ’s upcoming election this year is like a soccer match between big teams , where supporters of one candidate and the other are solely distinguished by the colors of their shirts , since the strongest teams accept the rules of the game and even tactics are similar .
according to the socialist sociologist francisco de oliveira , the coldness of the electoral landscape is closely related to one reality : the “ irrelevance ” of politics due to its “ financiarisation . ”
but the most important changes must come from within the media industry itself .
because journalists ’ safety directly affects news organizations ’ employees , freelancers , and audiences , these organizations should report on the topic .
with attacks on the press increasing , the old approach – prideful silence – no longer makes sense .
if the journalists use their platforms to inform the world of the dangers they and their colleagues face , the world will have to listen .
violence against journalists has historically been an issue that has remained behind the headlines .
rome – in 2010 , global leaders achieved the millennium development goal ( mdg ) of reducing the share of the world ’s poor to half of its 1990 level – five years ahead of schedule .
but rising unemployment and falling incomes underscore the enduring threat of poverty worldwide .
after all , poverty is not an unchanging attribute of a fixed group ; it is a condition that threatens billions of vulnerable people .
despite their shortcomings , income measures are useful in gaining a better understanding of the extent of poverty and vulnerability worldwide .
but the world bank ’s poverty line of $ 1.25 per day ( in purchasing-power-parity terms ) , which is used in measuring progress toward the mdgs ’ poverty-reduction target , is not the only relevant threshold .
and an abundance of policy and regulatory uncertainties will keep private investment spending in check .
the outlook for 2014 is dampened by longer-term constraints as well .
indeed , there is a looming risk of secular stagnation in many advanced economies , owing to the adverse effect on productivity growth of years of underinvestment in human and physical capital .
and the structural reforms that these economies need to boost their potential growth will be implemented too slowly .
while the eurozone ’s tail risks are lower , its fundamental problems remain unresolved : low potential growth ; high unemployment ; still-high and rising levels of public debt ; loss of competitiveness and slow reduction of unit labor costs ( which a strong euro does not help ) ; and extremely tight credit rationing , owing to banks ’ ongoing deleveraging .
but realizing that value is a long-term proposition .
more immediately , to get the gas to market in europe and elsewhere , a gas liquefaction plant costing about € 10 billion needs to be built , and israeli investors have already expressed interest .
the sheer size of cyprus ’s likely energy wealth , and the funding needed to develop it , dwarfs the country ’s current financial woes .
yes , cyprus needs € 17 billion to remain in the eurozone , whereas its annual gdp is just € 23 billion .
but these figures have to be placed in the context of the eu ’s gloomy overall energy picture – something that the ongoing debt negotiations have failed to do .
syriza is hardly alone in greece in blaming the eu for the country 's woes .
new democracy and pasok do much the same , attacking the eu , “ speculators , " and hedge funds – anyone who might divert the public 's attention from their own responsibility for the crisis .
greece 's largest private media , controlled by the country 's oligarchs , are happy to oblige .
thus , most television channels speak of the bailout deal just as tsipras does : as the proximate cause of austerity , a result of neoliberal dogma .
as a result , for too many people in greece , austerity reflects germany 's deranged obsession with discipline , not their country 's profligacy .
after all , it was tiny qatar that brokered lebanon ’s domestic settlement , egypt that mediated the gaza cease-fire , and turkey that is facilitating the israeli-syrian talks .
israel ’s shift in policy towards syria , and that of french president nicolas sarkozy , was a powerful message to the americans that they should not miss the lebanese train as well .
but america ’s dwindling leverage can not match the influence of the region ’s “ axis of evil . ”
lebanon is too vulnerable to pressure from syria and iran , neither of which wants to see their local clients relieve the israelis of the burden of a “ lebanese front ” before their own grievances are addressed .
nor is hezbollah keen to see the end of israel ’s occupation of the sheba farms on the lebanon border undermine its claim to the formidable independent military force that it has built with iranian and syrian help .
but with clarida ’s input , the fed will be more inclined to focus on actual inflation trends , rather than on the official unemployment rate and its implications under traditional models .
moreover , while fed staff members tend to believe that the us economy ’s rate of potential growth is very low ( around 1.75-2 % ) , clarida , like powell , seems open to the idea that trump ’s tax cuts and deregulatory policies , combined with the next wave of technological innovation , will allow for somewhat stronger non-inflationary growth .
finally , clarida is spearheading an internal strategy review to determine whether the fed should start making up for below-target inflation during recessions and slow recoveries by allowing for above-target inflation during expansionary periods .
and though the review is still in its early stages , the fed already seems to have embraced the idea that inflation should be allowed to exceed 2 % without immediately triggering a tightening .
taken together , these factors suggest that the fed could remain in pause mode for the rest of 2019 .
it is governments – and thus taxpayers and bondholders – that finance nuclear plants .
moreover , the alleged “ cost-savings ” of nuclear power never include the price tag for direct and indirect governmental subsidies , decommissioning of aging facilities , and emergency clean-up and remediation of impacted communities when disasters occur – all , again , at taxpayers ’ expense .
at fukushima , for example , the bill will include the costs of the heroic efforts by hundreds of workers to cool down the plant ’s reactors ; the protracted loss of economic output in the 20-kilometer exclusion zone ( estimated at $ 128.5 billion by roubini global economics ) ; decommissioning and clean-up costs ; and the costs of replacing 4.7 gigawatts of generating capacity .
on top of that , there is the possibility of health-care costs resulting from exposure to radioactivity .
all of these hidden costs make the price of nuclear energy higher than the price of shifting to renewable energies and improving energy efficiency .
otherwise , they would be stifling debate .
this would run counter to what universities stand for .
as a pragmatic matter , it would also backfire , by giving the trump camp another opportunity to demonize the “ liberal elite . ”
but clear rules of engagement are necessary .
the most important principle to uphold is the distinction between hearing someone and honoring someone .
new york – like an inmate on death row , the euro has received another last-minute stay of execution .
it will survive a little longer .
the markets are celebrating , as they have after each of the four previous “ euro crisis ” summits – until they come to understand that the fundamental problems have yet to be addressed .
there was good news in this summit : europe ’s leaders have finally understood that the bootstrap operation by which europe lends money to the banks to save the sovereigns , and to the sovereigns to save the banks , will not work .
likewise , they now recognize that bailout loans that give the new lender seniority over other creditors worsen the position of private investors , who will simply demand even higher interest rates .
munich – the german constitutional court has delivered its long-awaited decision on the european central bank ’s “ outright monetary transactions ” program .
since its launch in 2012 , the omt program has allowed the ecb to buy , if necessary , unlimited amounts of troubled eurozone countries ’ government bonds , provided the affected countries subscribe to the rules of europe ’s rescue fund , the european stability mechanism .
thousands of germans appealed to the constitutional court against the omt program , arguing that it violates article 123 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union , which bars monetary financing of eurozone governments , and that it imposes substantial risks on german citizens as taxpayers .
the court has now declared that it fully endorses the plaintiffs ’ arguments , and that the omt program does indeed violate eu primary law .
but , rather than issuing a formal ruling that would constrain the bundesbank and the german parliament , as it could have done , the court asked the european court of justice for its opinion .
and capital gains tax has fallen by more than 50 % since the 1980s .
in order to build support for public investment in higher-risk innovation , perhaps taxpayers should receive a more direct return , by channeling profits into a public innovation fund to finance the next wave of technologies .
when investments are in upstream basic research , the spillover effect across industries and sectors is sometimes enough of a social reward .
but other cases might require creating alternative incentives .
for example , some of the profits from the government ’s investment in tesla could have been recovered through shares ( or royalties ) , and used to cover the losses from its investment in solyndra .
if the ecb ’s next leaders do not meet them , the euro itself will be at risk .
complicating matters further , by 2020 , the european commission and the european council will each have a new president and leadership teams of their own , and the european parliament will have seated a new generation of politicians who have not taken part in the past decade ’s compromises and reforms .
on the contrary , many of them will have been elected in a political environment of anger , diminished trust , and intra-eu fragmentation .
still , there is a broad consensus that the eurozone will need more than monetary policy to ensure continued growth and stability .
obviously , with interest rates at the zero lower bound , more monetary/fiscal-policy coordination is a must .
in the event , most social media-enabled popular uprisings failed for want of effective leadership , and traditional political and military organizations retained the upper hand .
in fact , these regimes have begun to wield social media for their own ends .
we have all heard the allegations that russia covertly used social media to influence electoral outcomes in ukraine , france , germany , and , most famously , in the united states .
facebook has estimated that russian content on its network , including posts and paid ads , reached 126 million americans , around 40 % of the nation ’s population .
we should recall earlier accusations by russia of the west ’s role in fomenting the “ color revolutions ” in ukraine and georgia .
but he is not immune to miscalculation .
in 2005 , mahmoud ahmadinejad relied on khamenei ’s financial and political support to win the presidency .
today , however , khamenei is profoundly regretful about that choice .
ahmadinejad disobeys his orders , tries to discredit him with the public by challenging his authority , and undermines key institutions , including the judiciary and the parliament .
it is an open secret in iranian political circles that khamenei also regrets permitting volunteers of the basij militia to attack the british embassy last november .
but it is not clear whether china ’s leaders will recognize this and act in their country ’s own long-term self interest .
the point is not to single out china .
similar questions apply to india and brazil .
and it is not just the developing and emerging countries that must reconsider their approach to the world .
the us must do so as well .
nor should we worry a great deal that some people are richer than others .
some people work harder , apply their intelligence more skillfully , or simply have been lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time .
but i do n’t see what alternative political-economic arrangements could make individuals ’ relative wealth closely correspond to their relative moral or other merit .
the problems that can be addressed are those of poverty and social insurance — of providing a safety net — not of inequality .
but on the level of individual societies , i believe that inequality does loom as a serious political-economic problem .
more broadly , however , her point is that we need the fsoc to be able to do its job – to look for and assess all kinds of potential systemic risks .
this needs to be done as a technical matter , not as part of the political process .
not everyone at the sec is as sensible as stein .
there is also some friction among the various regulators in the us , and we surely need more coordination across national borders – including with europe .
but the real danger is that powerful lobbies , working through members of congress , are pushing back hard against the fsoc and its mandate .
the final factor driving iohannis ’s victory was the younger generation , in whom connections with the western world have imbued an eagerness to see real democratic progress in romania .
when the results were announced , their euphoria was overwhelming .
in bucharest ’s university square , the celebration recalled the energy of 1989 ; it was the sound of an awakened electorate , aware of its previous mistakes and ready for a fresh start .
iohannis may also have benefited , to some extent , from an association in voters ’ minds with the german hohenzollern kings who ruled romania wisely and with dedication for more than 80 years .
and , indeed , upon learning of his victory , iohannis immediately paid a visit to king michael i ( a hohenzollern prince until he renounced the title in 2011 ) .
while tens of millions of chinese young people display impressive innate abilities , the country ’s system of higher education does an abysmal job cultivating their talents .
for most , the curriculum is largely obsolete , and skewed toward rote learning of theory at the expense of basic analytical and critical-thinking skills .
education in social sciences and humanities is particularly deficient , owing to lack of investment in these disciplines and excessive political control of curricula .
as a result , chinese graduate from colleges and universities having learned relatively little about the outside world in fields such as anthropology , sociology , international relations , comparative literature , and history .
unless china reforms its ossified system , the country will not be able to produce enough highly trained talent to compete with the world ’s best and brightest .
these reforms will create new markets , stimulate competition , attract foreign investment and technology transfers , and improve consumer interests .
finally , global economic conditions will compel even more restructuring upon japan .
japan has committed to further liberalization of its markets under the wto .
while export expansion delivered growth in this century , import substitution and inward foreign direct investment ( fdi ) will lead to increasing productivity in japan in the next .
imports inspire a more competitive domestic business environment .
i believe that the west can learn a great deal about what to do by studying the policies pursued in the world 's only two mid-development moslem states , tunisia and indonesia , because each successfully avoided becoming prey to islamic fundamentalism .
tunisia 's achievement is noteworthy given its proximity to violence-prone algeria .
both countries combined substantial increases in secular education with rapid job creation in manufacturing jobs ; stressed rural development and labor-intensive exports ; and pursued rapid , egalitarian development .
egalitarian development of this sort is the only viable answer to the problems of the moslem world 's mal-development .
however , it provides no short-term answer to terrorism for several reasons : it does not supply an ideology compelling enough to compete with fundamentalism , which has captured at least two generations in the moslem world .
new haven – yet another in a long string of negative inflation surprises is at hand .
in the united states , the so-called core cpi ( consumer price index ) – which excludes food and energy – has headed down just when it was supposed to be going up .
over the three months ending in may , the core cpi was basically unchanged , holding , at just 1.7 % above its year-earlier level .
for a us economy that is widely presumed to be nearing the hallowed ground of full employment , this comes as a rude awakening – particularly for the federal reserve , which has pulled out all the stops to get inflation back to its 2 % target .
halfway around the world , a similar story continues to play out in japan .
the nobel laureate economist amartya sen traces the origins of indian democratic dialogue to the third-century bc buddhist emperor ashoka .
he also contrasts the religious tolerance preached and practiced by the muslim emperor akbar in the 1590 ’s with the inquisition , which was hounding heretics in europe at around the same time .
our assumptions about the relative prosperity of asia and the west should also be reconsidered .
as recently as 200 years ago , asia accounted for 60 % of global gdp .
however , following the industrial revolution in northwestern europe , the colonization of much of asia , and the opium wars in china , their relative positions switched .
the core protective legal institution for outside finance , the federal securities laws , did n’t fall into place until the 1930 ’s – decades after us financial markets had grown to finance america ’s economic rise .
britain and japan seem to have followed the same sequence : finance first , protective institutions later .
japan had no corporate law until complex business finance started developing at the end of the nineteenth century .
yet that sequence is the opposite of what one might have expected : only after financial markets developed did those with a stake in them press for better legislation to protect investors .
so , in britain , japan , and the us , something more foundational must have been in place before financial markets started operating .
insufficient spending was never an issue .
from 1998 to 2007 , greece 's annual per capita gdp growth averaged 3.8 % , the second fastest in western europe , behind only ireland .
but by 2007 , greece was spending more than 14 % of gdp in excess of what it was producing , the largest such gap in europe – more than twice that of spain and 55 % higher than ireland 's .
in spain and ireland , though , the gap reflected a construction boom ; euro accession suddenly gave people access to much cheaper mortgages .
in greece , by contrast , the gap was mostly fiscal and used for consumption , not investment .
true , the quality of democratic governance can sometimes be augmented by reducing the discretion of elected representatives .
well-functioning democracies often delegate rule-making power to quasi-independent bodies when the issues at hand are technical and do not raise distributional concerns ; when log-rolling would otherwise result in sub-optimal outcomes for all ; or when policies are subject to myopia , with heavy discounting of future costs .
independent central banks provide an important illustration of this .
it may be up to elected politicians to determine the inflation target , but the means deployed to achieve that target are left to the technocrats at the central bank .
even then , central banks typically remain accountable to politicians and must provide an accounting when they miss the targets .
first , it is important to realize that a strong and overly volatile currency is not just the central bank ’s problem to fix .
while the central bank bears a good part of the responsibility , it needs support from other parts of the government , most notably from the finance ministry .
maintaining a competitive currency requires a rise in domestic saving relative to investment , or a reduction in national expenditure relative to income .
otherwise , the competitiveness gains would be offset by rising inflation .
this means that the fiscal authorities have a big responsibility : to target a structural fiscal surplus that is high enough to generate the space needed for real exchange rate depreciation .
there is something about the narrative – a sex symbol sacrificing her fetishized breasts for the sake of her children , with her husband staying by her side – that is deeply reassuring to women in western culture .
one can be reasonably certain , however , that jolie ’s decision will alter the roles available to her as an actress .
as enthusiastically as the global mass media has received her choice , it is nonetheless extremely difficult in the west for a woman to be portrayed as maternal – let alone physically “ flawed ” or “ impaired ” – and also as a fantasy sex object .
but the real importance of jolie ’s story is its context : a wave of women and men , in very different settings around the world , who are insisting on narrating their own meanings for events involving their bodies – events that , like breast cancer , were once shrouded in shame , silence , fear , or blame .
jolie has refused to treat mastectomy as scary or tragic – or as making her “ less of a woman ” in any way .
it is this danger that sets a practical and political limit to flexible exchange rates .
some depreciation can be managed by most of the deficit countries ; but a vicious circle could be triggered if the domestic currency loses too much value too quickly .
private-sector balance-sheet problems would weaken the financial sector , and the resulting pressure on public finances would compel austerity , thereby constraining consumer demand – and causing further damage to firms ’ balance sheets .
to prevent such a crisis , therefore , the exchange rate has to be managed – and in a manner that depends on a country ’s specific circumstances .
large net central-bank reserves can help ease the process .
free speech is more firmly protected by law in the us than anywhere else in the world .
but the cancellation of barr 's show was , of course , not a legal decision .
the limits of free speech are not just legal .
entertainment companies or mass media are sensitive to public opinion .
people tend to get fired , for commercial reasons , if something they have said is deemed to be offensive to a large number of people .
not one has a muslim majority .
this phenomenon has been noted within the muslim world as well .
in the summer of 2002 , a team of arab scholars produced the arab human development report , written on behalf of the un development program and the arab fund for economic and social development .
it portrays an arab world lagging behind other regions in key measures , including individual freedom and women 's empowerment , as well as economic and social development .
disturbing trends , such as a demographic youth " bulge " combined with high youth unemployment rates -- reaching almost 40 % in some places -- highlight potentially explosive social conditions .
but , given the global balance of power , this was more symbolic than a reflection of their real influence .
then came the end of the cold war , when all of europe adopted a staunch transatlantic orientation .
in terms of security , europe remained dependent on the us .
but on the economic and technological fronts , europeans had regained their sovereignty .
institutionally , this division of labor was manifested in nato and the eu , respectively .
he announced that he had hired eyal arad , a well-known israeli spin-doctor , to run his presidential campaign .
" the jews " were not his enemies any more , he said ; they were even working for him .
but tudor did n't stop with prolix apologies .
he soon sponsored the unveiling of a bust of the assassinated israeli premier yitzak rabin at brasov in transylvania .
for the occasion , tudor wore a yarmulke and spoke about his " philo-semitism " for more than two hours .
and independent investigative journalists in africa have often exposed high-level corruption , abuse of power , and shady business deals .
for example , in kenya , a leading local newspaper reported that philip kinisu , former chairman of the ethics and anti-corruption commission , had received suspicious payments from the national youth service .
further investigations into the nys revealed more corrupt deals , spurring kenyans to take to the streets in protest .
but those with power know how to fight back – and they do not pull their punches .
as a result , in many african countries , the free press is being compromised , suppressed , and even dismantled .
china ’s economy has succeeded through trial and error , and the lessons of its current stress test should be viewed as part of that process , to be used to drive the next phase of economic reform .
one key lesson is that chinese stock markets remain structurally biased toward state ownership and guidance , even as the country builds a more entrepreneurial economy .
this is fundamentally problematic , because it is the market ( not the state ) that will identify and support the unicorns .
nonetheless , china has already begun to build a more innovative manufacturing sector and an internet-driven retail sector , and the state can still play a role in fostering innovation .
but , as the government determines how to offload its massive holdings of shares in an orderly manner , it must ensure that such efforts are funded by equity , not leverage , thereby enhancing market balance and resilience .
his sudden departure due to illness might cause a political vacuum , which could become conducive to a power grab of one form or another , such as a military coup .
strict adherence to constitutional provisions in any such eventuality is imperative .
here , the lack of free media is especially alarming and does not bode well for a free and fair election .
it is essential that the opposition can freely air its message and target prospective voters – a point not lost on the chávez regime as it seeks to curtail further the opposition ’s ability to reach out to the electorate .
the recent attack on globovision , venezuela ’s only surviving independent station , stands out in this regard .
what a difference a decade makes .
during the 1990 ’s , private investors looked at big , lumbering central banks as cash cows , long on money and short on financial acumen .
george soros once made a billion dollars off the bank of england in just an hour .
his basic strategy was a standard one : bet against any central bank that tries to defend an inconsistent macroeconomic policy .
traders did not win every battle , of course .
yet , contrary to expectations , growth in household consumption has remained lackluster , and businesses have not ramped up investment .
in the first two quarters of this year , america ’s gdp barely exceeded the level it attained at the end of last year , and much of the increase was driven by goods that have been produced but not yet sold .
the prevailing explanation – a brutally cold winter – is wearing so thin that everyone should be able to see through it .
american consumers remain scarred by the crisis .
but there is another problem : in their homes and workplaces , the sense of excitement about the future is missing , despite all the gee-whiz gadgetry that now surrounds them .
nowhere is the need to overcome financing bottlenecks more apparent than with germany ’s energiewende ( energy transition ) .
to succeed , more than € 30 billion , or 1 % of gdp , will have to be invested annually in network infrastructure , renewable-energy generation , combined heat and power systems , and storage technologies in the coming decades .
while some of these funds will come from public budgets , the vast majority will have to be provided by the private sector .
moreover , bringing germany ’s digital infrastructure , especially its broadband networks , up to international standards will require significant investment , which an improved regulatory framework could help to encourage .
regulatory reform is also needed to strengthen support for startup companies – an area in which germany is notoriously weak , reflected in the difficulties such companies face in obtaining venture capital .
beijing – is china poised to surpass the united states to become the world ’s largest economy ?
the international monetary fund recently predicted that the size of china ’s economy would overtake that of the us in terms of purchasing power parity ( ppp ) by 2016 .
but a recent co-authored study by robert feenstra , an economist at the university of california , davis , shows that global economic leadership would pass to china in 2014 .
and , even more radically , arvind subramanian of the peterson institute of international economics argues that china actually surpassed the us in ppp terms in 2010 .
purchasing power parity measures a country ’s income using a set of international prices applied to all economies .
but one should not jump to conclusions .
a balance of energy imports and exports is only a first approximation of independence .
as i argue in my book the future of power , global interdependence involves both sensitivity and vulnerability .
the us may be less vulnerable in the long run if it imports less energy , but oil is a fungible commodity , and the us economy will remain sensitive to shocks from sudden changes in world prices .
in other words , a revolution in saudi arabia or a blockade of the strait of hormuz could still inflict damage on the us and its allies .
the amazon and indonesian rainforests are burning , and climate catastrophes such as typhoons , tornadoes , and floods are intensifying , with dire consequences for entire populations .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
the bottom may be near – perhaps by the end of the year .
but that does not mean that the global economy is set for a robust recovery any time soon .
hitting bottom is no reason to abandon the strong measures that have been taken to revive the global economy .
this downturn is complex : an economic crisis combined with a financial crisis .
before its onset , america ’s debt-ridden consumers were the engine of global growth .
tackling the world ’s environmental and ecological problems , and improving the lot of those who have been left behind , will require public action , such as that which i oversaw in my roles at the world bank , the united nations , and the british government .
but it will also demand the participation of business .
in my own career , i have seen firsthand that the growth fueled by business competition in a globalizing world can do far more to combat poverty , hunger , and disease than government-funded programs alone .
but when that competition is not conducted responsibly , the opposite can happen – and , in many cases , it has .
in seizing the opportunities of globalization , businesses have often neglected the developed-world workers they leave behind , while subjecting developing-country workers to extraordinary deprivation .
but it would be an incendiary move .
many leavers would see it as an anti-democratic coup .
and because it would reverse the 2016 referendum result , such a step would necessitate a new plebiscite pitching remain against no deal .
with luck , johnson ’s scorched-earth tactics will spur his disparate opponents into overcoming their differences to stop a no-deal brexit .
but whatever happens , the pragmatic center is being squeezed out of british politics .
to support these efforts , we urge un secretary-general antónio guterres to appoint a special representative for the ocean , tasked with improving ocean governance and ensuring that the full potential of sdg 14 is realized .
such a representative must be given sufficient resources to do the job .
the ocean has suffered decades of abuse and neglect .
it has been treated as a free-for-all garbage bin and race-to-the-bottom buffet .
we have financed its destruction , with no regard for the consequences .
when crops fail , many farmers and agricultural workers laid low by the crushing burden of debt ( often incurred at usurious rates from rural moneylenders ) commit suicide – as more than 11,400 did in 2016 .
that is the last year for which official data on farmer suicides is available , but media reports suggest the numbers have grown since then .
the biggest victims of the bjp government ’s neglect of agriculture have been the country ’s small and marginal farmers , as well as landless farm labor .
these groups were dealt a body blow two years ago by modi ’s thoughtless and foolhardy demonetization scheme , which abruptly withdrew 86 % of india ’s currency from circulation overnight .
daily wage workers , traditionally paid in cash , lost their jobs by the millions , because replacement currency had not been printed in adequate quantities .
with six billion humans and counting – and our individual consumption growing – we face enormous challenges in using our natural resources sustainably .
and there is one clear measure of how we perform at that task : extinction rates .
for this reason , some colleagues and i have calculated the rate at which bird species became extinct in the recent past and the rate at which they will likely become extinct in the future .
bird extinctions are our best window onto humanity ’s massive and irreversible environmental impact .
for every one of the world ’s 10,000 bird species , there may be 10 or perhaps even 100 other unknown species of animals , plants , or fungi .
and , finally – perhaps most important – they allow their users to perceive patterns and opportunities that would be impossible to discover through traditional means .
cognitive systems are inspired by the human brain , an organ that still has much to teach us .
with systems growing in size and complexity , traditional computer architecture seems to be reaching its limits , as power consumption soars and the transmission delay between components becomes increasingly burdensome .
indeed , when it comes to energy efficiency – measured in terms of the number of computations per energy unit on “ unstructured ” data – the human brain performs roughly 10,000 times better than the best man-made machines .
today , computers consume about 10 % of the world ’s electricity output , according to mark mills , ceo of the digital power group .
munich – discussions are now underway to establish a system of joint deposit insurance for eurozone banks .
proponents of the scheme , with the european commission and the european central bank ( ecb ) taking the lead , point out that deposit insurance would avert the danger of a run on banks in times of crisis .
while this argument is true , critics emphasize the disparity in risks , owing to the high share of bad loans on the balance sheets of banks in some countries .
to address this risk disparity and move ahead with the plan , balance sheets will need to be cleaned up before considering the next step .
while the share of bad loans for banks in the stable eurozone countries is just 2 % , the most recently published international monetary fund statistics , from last april , show a share of 11 % for ireland , 16 % for italy , 40 % for cyprus , and 46 % for greece .
she is in prison because she lost that power .
this sets a dangerous precedent , for it creates a powerful incentive – winner takes all , loser goes to prison – for ruthlessness .
it is difficult to predict how tymoshenko ’s case will play out – whether yanukovych will succumb to pressure from the european union and the united states to release her , or to the forces that want to exclude her from politics forever .
until recently , ukrainian leaders were accustomed to more efficient means than prison for dealing with inconvenient opponents .
in 2000 , for example , the journalist georgiy gongadze was kidnapped and beheaded after publishing online reports about high-level government corruption .
for innovation is what creates wealth and employment , despite -- or , rather because of -- competition from poor countries .
and increased wealth in rich countries helps the poor by increasing demand for their goods .
this virtuous circle is still seen by globalization ’s enemies as in fact a vicious one , encouraging exploitation of the poor and vulnerable .
it is here that questions of universal principles of justice and human rights enter the debate .
undoubtedly , there is a strong case to be made for universal , impartial application of values .
that is why abe was the first foreign politician , after british prime minister theresa may , to rush to congratulate trump in person in 2017 .
in some important ways , japan has benefited greatly from being under america ’s wing , and from the postwar constitution , which is not just pacifist , but more democratic than anything the country had before , enshrining individual rights , full suffrage , and freedom of expression .
constitutionally unable to take part in military adventures , except as a highly paid goods producer during america ’s various asian conflicts , japan , rather like the countries in western europe , could concentrate on rebuilding its industrial power .
but the democracy that americans are still proud of installing after 1945 has also been hindered by us interference .
like italy , japan was on the frontlines in the cold war .
all of this economic legerdemain was magnified by television , print , and internet journalists .
aside from a small number of good stories in the business press , it is difficult to argue that anyone who read or listened to english-language media coverage of the campaign could have learned anything interesting or relevant to the question of whose economic policy was likely to be better for america .
the economics profession bears part of the blame for this .
nobel prize winners such as edward prescott have no business talking about the benefits of tax cuts without pointing out that a tax cut accompanied by spending increases is not a tax cut at all , but rather a tax shift onto the future - and a tax shift that raises risk and discourages accumulation .
but much of the problem stems from an under-briefed , undereducated , and uncurious press corps .
until now , they have failed abysmally in institutional nation-building , a necessary requirement for any successful national movement .
palestinian nationalism is deeply ingrained in the consciousness of most palestinians – yet , since 1948 , when the united nations proposed partitioning british palestine into two states , a jewish and an arab one , it has failed to move from ideology towards reality .
neither violence nor terrorism nor relying on outside powers ( the un , the arab league , the soviet union , the us , the european union ) succeeded in delivering statehood , which a people can achieve only by its own agency – what zionist ideology calls “ auto-emancipation . ”
fayyad is the first palestinian leader who did not emerge from the fatah movement , and he may thus understand what other palestinian leaders failed to comprehend , mired as they were in a toxic combination of self-righteous ideology and violence .
it may just be that the palestinians are on the verge of a new chapter in their history – and in the history of israel and the whole region as well .
any diplomatic effort to denuclearize north korea must also alleviate china ’s geostrategic concerns about the future of the korean peninsula .
for centuries , china has feared that the peninsula could become part of a chain of encirclement , or serve as an invasion route .
in 1592 , the japanese general toyotomi hideyoshi invaded the korean kingdom to establish a beachhead for invading china .
in response , china , under the ming dynasty , fought alongside korea against the japanese army .
three centuries later , china ’s qing dynasty fought the sino-japanese war of 1894 to prevent japan from dominating korea .
but it is a slant that merits attention , because the problem can not be solved with the conventional policy responses .
the “ official ” narrative about technology treats accelerating change as inevitable .
according to acronymically named institutions , think tanks , task forces , et hoc genus omne , automation and artificial intelligence ( ai ) will soon eliminate or alter a large but unpredictable number of human jobs .
at the same time , embracing new technology is considered necessary for a country ’s geopolitical and competitive success .
thus , disruptions to existing work patterns should be welcomed and “ mitigated , ” by adapting education and social-security systems to the needs of an automation-driven job market .
first , develop , sustain , and utilize local capacities and leadership .
developing scientific and technical capacity is less difficult than sustaining it , and sustaining it is less difficult than utilizing it .
yet , the ultimate impact of science and technology depends on all three factors .
so african nations must invest in scientific and technological education and training .
each nation must also develop strategies that offer scientists and technologists local employment opportunities .
the code of conduct on the field – where we expect players to give their all under clear rules that are swiftly enforced by independent referees – is fundamentally the same as what we expect from governing bodies off the field .
in this sense , fifa is not a special case : all non-profit and for-profit organizations around the world are expected to abide by this code of conduct .
and that is why fifa ’s problems are unlikely to fade from view .
they must be addressed head-on , with a clean sweep of its leadership and a complete overhaul of its governance structures .
fifa is as complex as any large multinational private or public organization ; how it is governed must reflect that .
in the west , young people have largely dispensed with the home-delivered physical morning newspaper , and instead catch up on the news whenever they choose , using tablets , laptops , or mobile phones .
as advertising revenue has been vacuumed up by the internet giants facebook and google , newspaper profits have plunged .
the industry has faced many bankruptcies in recent years , with those still operating often having laid off large numbers of staff , especially in their foreign bureaus .
in the united states , the number of full-time journalists has dropped by 20 % since 2001 .
even several grand titles have either closed down or publish only online .
people came from the baltic countries in the 1940s , hungary in 1956 , chile after the 1973 coup , and iran after the 1979 revolution .
for decades , swedish industry was dependent on immigrant workers .
during the bosnian war of the 1990s , sweden opened its doors to some 100,000 people – a challenge at any time , much less during a period of profound economic crisis .
but it still turned out well : the bosnian immigrants have fared roughly as well as the swedes who received them , and they have enriched our society .
in the new century , refugees have come increasingly from the middle east and the horn of africa .
one-third of those companies have acquired a tech company since the beginning of 2015 .
foreign firms are also rushing to take advantage of europe ’s tech talent .
google , facebook , and amazon have all announced major expansions of their european tech hubs .
transactions worth more than $ 88 billion took place last year – compared to just $ 3.3 billion in 2014 – including softbank ’s purchase of the british semiconductor-design firm arm and qualcomm ’s $ 47 billion purchase of nxp semiconductors .
another study , by the boston consulting group , points out that many small export-oriented european union member countries – namely , the benelux , baltic , and nordic countries – rank well above the us in so-called “ e-intensity , ” which covers it infrastructure , internet access , as well as businesses , consumer , and government engagement in internet-related activities .
the china dream is no exception .
so far , public reaction has ranged from puzzlement to derision .
after a decade of government by slogan , the chinese public wants substance .
this presents xi with a real challenge .
he has risen to the top by winning friends and allies inside the ccp .
demonstrations begin in major cities , calling for an end to corruption among party officials .
china ’s government decides that it can not risk further strife and announces a package of measures to boost economic growth and prevent layoffs , including direct financial support for exporters and intervention in the currency markets to weaken the renminbi .
in the us , president mitt romney has just taken office , following a hard-fought campaign in which he derided barack obama for being too soft on china ’s economic policies .
the combination of financial contagion from europe , which has already led to a severe credit crunch , and a sudden flood of low-priced imports from china leaves the romney administration in a bind .
against the advice of his economic advisers , he announces across-the-board import duties on chinese exports .
why would the administration continue to bend over backwards to be lenient towards top bankers under these circumstances ?
i honestly do not believe that the administration ’s stance reflects any form of corruption – payments made to individuals or even to political campaigns .
and , in this case , it does not even appear to reflect the lobbying power of big financial players .
that power certainly explains why the dodd-frank financial reforms enacted in 2010 were not stronger , and why there is now so much opposition to effective implementation of that legislation ( for example , there is currently a huge fight around the “ volcker rule , ” which would limit proprietary trading by megabanks ) .
but mortgage lenders ’ criminal activities are another matter .
in fact , much of what happened in bosnia – including the effort , in its aftermath , to realize concepts of universal justice – has applications for the contemporary world .
indeed , those who recall the bosnian war can find many of its features in syria today .
like bosnia , syria seems hopelessly divided among warring factions , and the violence there seems to be unstoppable .
the international community has been unable to achieve any unity of action , much less agreement on a way forward .
of course , there are important differences as well .
given china ’s own history of vulnerability to foreign intervention , unilateral us efforts to maintain overwhelming offensive superiority would only trigger an increasingly destabilizing arms race .
some american strategists advocate a largely technological solution to this dilemma .
their approach , a concept called “ air-sea battle , ” implies a mix of defensive and offensive tools to address the new challenges posed by the proliferation of precision-strike weaponry .
officially , the pentagon does not direct the concept of “ air-sea battle ” against any particular country .
for example , iran ’s possession of precision-strike capabilities – and a much more hostile relationship with america – would warrant new us initiatives to cope with growing security vulnerabilities .
should she take up an important role at this stage ?
or should she pursue happiness as a woman ?
mrs. watanabe gives her daughter the nudge she needs .
mrs. watanabe has a talent for seeing how the tide turns .
her advice is to grab the opportunity at work , and also find happiness in marriage and children .
although we can and will continue the fight against corruption , we can not do everything alone .
international support for our efforts is crucial .
a positive sign here is the recent decision by the european bank for reconstruction and development ( ebrd ) to provide $ 215 million to complete the nuclear power stations at rivne and khmelnytsky , which will compensate for the loss of chernobyl ’s generating capacity .
euroatom is also helping with a loan of $ 585 million to finance repairs at ukraine ’s functioning nuclear power plants .
in return , ukraine will uphold its end of the deal : in addition to closing chernobyl , we will introduce western nuclear safety standards and renew cooperation with the imf via the extended fund facility program .
russia 's people wanted to make a difference and amazingly they did : their energy and cohesion put an end to communist rule .
of course , what russia had in the late 1980 's and early 1990 's was n't institutionalized democracy , but revolutionary excitement .
it was expected that out of this sea of democratic emotion new political institutions would emerge .
instead , political life here has been reduced to mere formality .
although there 's nothing like soviet oppression , the alienation between state and society resembles that of soviet days .
berlin – more than a year into the arab revolts , their outcomes remain highly uncertain .
but some initial lessons for international politics – and for western , particularly european , foreign policy – merit serious consideration .
almost everyone was surprised by the revolts , although the political and socioeconomic causal factors were well known .
as is often true in crises that become systemic , we knew the phenomena , but failed to grasp their interaction , in part because politicians and analysts are unwilling to anticipate ruptures : the familiar is held to be stable even when it is known to be problematic .
( consider saudi arabia , which the united states and most of the west continue to regard as an island of “ stability . ” )
when the market tightened in 2011 , many projects ’ prospects diminished , spurring lgfvs to seek credit in the shadow banking sector , which has caused their borrowing costs to rise and introduced new market-based challenges to the reform process .
nonetheless , because china is a net lender to the world , lgfv debt has no global systemic implications .
while china ’s outstanding local-government debt totaled cn ¥ 29 trillion ( $ 4.7 trillion ) at the end of 2011 , its land and fixed assets are worth some cn ¥ 90 trillion , meaning that even if asset values were written down by half , local governments would remain solvent .
this leaves only the issue of debt servicing .
to resolve it , the government has announced fiscal reforms to split revenues between central and local governments and enable local governments to issue long-term municipal bonds .
the dominance of free-market ideology before the crisis allowed many controversial social changes , ranging from income inequality and intensified wage competition to greater gender equality and affirmative action , to go almost unchallenged .
“ progressive ” social liberalism and “ conservative ” free-market economics seemed to be two sides of the same coin .
but when free-market economic liberalism failed in the 2008 crisis , political challenges to social liberalism could no longer be deflected by invoking impersonal economic laws .
but if social change can no longer be legitimized as the necessary condition for economic progress , it seems unlikely that democracies will now vote to reinstate the social conditions before the ascendancy of economic liberalism and globalization .
racial and gender equality are now backed by clear majorities in the us , britain , and most european countries , and even apparently popular policies such as trade protectionism and strict immigration controls rarely muster more than 30-40 % support in opinion surveys .
as we predicted almost 20 years ago , china will struggle to attain growth above 5 % in the 2021-2030 period , for the simple reason that its workforce growth will have peaked .
while pessimists will no doubt find validation in the further chinese growth disappointments that are to come , optimists can point to the fact that 5 % annual growth in china is nominally equivalent to 15-20 % growth in germany .
at this stage in china ’s development , faster growth would actually be quite extraordinary .
it is equally predictable that india will start to grow at a much faster rate than china , simply because its workforce still has a lot of growing left to do .
the real question is whether india can implement strong productivity-enhancing reforms .
equally important is the contextual intelligence that allows a leader to vary the mix of these skills in different situations to produce the successful combinations that i call “ smart power . ”
during his campaign , obama demonstrated these skills in his calm response to crises , his forward-looking vision , and his superb organizational ability .
in addition , his contextual intelligence about world politics has been shaped from the bottom up with experience in indonesia and kenya , and his understanding of american politics was shaped from the bottom up as a community organizer in chicago .
obama continued to demonstrate these leadership skills in his almost flawless transition .
by selecting his primary opponent , hillary clinton , as his secretary of state , and reaching across party lines to retain robert gates as secretary of defense , he showed openness to strong subordinates .
with pakistan 's economy in a tailspin , and with the jihad culture of so many young pakistanis undermining the country 's international credibility , moderate voices are at long last breaking through .
the eminent columnist amin m. lakhani recently argued in the dawn , pakistan 's largest-circulation newspaper , that " pakistan 's singular preoccupation with kashmir ... has been self-defeating .
domestically , it has thwarted the country 's economic , social and political development .
internationally , [ it ] has diminished the country 's stature and left its reputation smeared .
even its spiritual development has been warped by the proliferation , popularization , and increase in relative power ... of religious groups that represent an intolerant , militant , and gender-based interpretation of islam . "
gref 's program , too , is emblematic of the president 's style : modernization from above -- ie , that initiated by government and under its pressure -- is matched by modernization from below , based on private initiative .
undeniably liberal ideas dominate the program : strengthening and protecting property rights , deregulation , and encouraging competition .
in addition , gref 's program seeks to create effective private land ownership .
deregulation ( " debureaucratization , " really ) will make life easier for new businesses by reducing the number of inspections imposed by bureaucrats and by decreasing the number of demands for licenses and other forms of red tape ( which were also big sources of bribery ) .
enhancing competition will mean putting emphasis on antitrust policy and reducing state subsidies .
the pattern is starting to look familiar : a new crisis , a new meeting in brussels , an initially muddled response , debates and divisions , and then gradual , step-by-step progress toward a common response , driven by the realization that there is no other alternative .
in today ’s disagreements lie the roots of a stronger union .
the public no longer thinks of the european project as some utopian endeavor , an abstract attempt to forge an ever-closer union .
increasingly , the eu is coming to be seen as a practical – and absolutely essential – mechanism for a group of small countries to work together to meet their common challenges .
the people of the eu are indeed waking up to a world that is more dangerous , divided , and disorienting .
in other words , would i have followed in the footsteps of several of my harvard colleagues who traveled to libya to exchange views with and advise its dictator – and were paid for their services ?
these scholars have been pilloried in the media in recent weeks for supposedly having cozied up to qaddafi .
sir howard davies chose to resign as director of the lse , which awarded saif his doctorate ( which some allege was plagiarized ) and took money for the school from the libyan regime .
there is a strong sentiment that academics and institutions that collaborated with such an odious regime – often with the encouragement of their governments , no doubt – suffered a grave lapse of judgment .
muammar el-qaddafi ’s murderous stance during the uprising has revealed his true colors , regardless of his more moderate posture in recent years .
in 2016 , obama faced difficult choices in estimating the escalatory potential of responding with cyber measures or with a cross-sector response such as sanctions .
the administration did not want to take steps that might themselves disrupt the election .
so , eight days before the vote , the us sent russia a warning about election meddling over a hotline – created three years earlier to deal with major cyber incidents – that connects the nuclear risk reduction centers in both countries .
because russian hacking activity seemed to slow or halt , the obama administration cited the warning as a successful exercise in deterrence .
but some critics say the russians had already achieved their main goals .
once it is established , support would be made available to humanitarian workers and educators to develop immediate plans for the provision of education to children affected by emergencies , based on the recognition that humanitarian , development , and security needs can no longer be addressed in silos .
an injection of financing , supporting a common strategy developed in partnership with governments , would enable the immediate delivery of education in emergency situations .
the fund will thus fill the gap in coordination and provision of services by strengthening the system at its weakest point , providing a bridge to longer-term development .
if this initiative had been in place before the earthquake in ecuador , it could have provided 12 months of emergency support , helping the country until it could reinstate education according to its national plans .
in a more protracted crisis , like that of syria , the funding platform could help neighboring countries establish , with the support of the international community , a long-term financing strategy , perhaps by brokering an arrangement whereby donor governments could pay the principal over 30 years on concessional loans from the world bank .
for all his deep emotional attachment to the idea of israel embracing all of historical judea and samaria , rabin knew that the only way to ensure a democratic jewish state with viable , secure borders was to accept a palestinian state alongside it , equally secure and viable .
they would share jerusalem as a capital , and find a mutually acceptable solution to the enormously sensitive issue of the return of palestinian refugees .
rabin ’s murder was a catastrophe from which the peace process has never recovered .
no israeli leader since has shown anything like his far-sighted vision , commitment , and capacity to deliver a negotiated two-state solution .
ehud barak and ehud olmert came close , but not close enough .
some might think that this could be true only if the logical end of evolution and intelligent life were to be a nuclear explosion that pulverized earth .
but that is not what schneider and sagan mean .
instead , they make a distinction between matter and energy and say that matter organized in structures disseminates energy gradients faster than randomly distributed matter .
as one example , they consider a phenomenon of which beer drinkers have long been aware .
if you want to empty a bottle of water ( or beer ) and turn it upside down , the water will come out in uneven glugs .
the notion of argentina as a country with infinite promise became a desaparecido , the name given to those who disappeared in the dirty war of the 1970 ’s .
we lost our organizing principle and no other idea has replaced it .
we no longer have a guide , an idea of how to think about our country , how to understand it and how to imagine who we are and who we can become .
argentina has become a country without direction .
it has n’t been easy living without knowing who we are , and it became even more difficult to live this way as we watched our world crumble .
for their part , some current cia officials continue to insist on the value of america ’s “ enhanced interrogation ” program ( which obama halted ) , despite the senate report ’s conclusion that the techniques it employed yielded no valuable intelligence .
indeed , other accounts of america ’s “ global war on terror ” also make it clear that many of the people who were detained and tortured were not threats to america ’s security – at least not until us actions made them so .
the week the senate report came out , i was reading anand gopal ’s new book no good men among the living , which tells contemporary afghanistan ’s story through the eyes of a supporter of former president hamid karzai , a taliban commander , and a kabul-born housewife who spent years in purdah in taliban country .
over and over again , the same story plays out : a local power-broker is willing , even eager , to support the new us-backed government , only to be denounced as a taliban member by a fellow afghan – typically for local political or personal reasons – to unwitting american troops .
indeed , this pattern recurs in the accounts of anyone who has lived in afghanistan , spoken the language , and understood the workings of patronage and power there .
replacing a governor whom they re-elected only a year before with arnold schwarzenegger must have given californian voters an enormous -- if guilty -- pleasure .
some members of the opposition in germany would dearly love to do the same to chancellor gerhard schröder , though they have not ( yet ! ) found a film star to replace him .
several other european governments find themselves in a similar state of unpopularity not long after being elected .
beyond europe this is true even for the recently acclaimed brazilian president luis inacio " lula " da silva , to say nothing of mexican president vicente fox and south korean president roh moo-hyun , the latter having called for a referendum to help arrest his sinking popularity .
electoral success , it appears , fades fast nowadays .
and , at the same time , the “ opening-up dividend ” was also reaching maturity , and encountering protectionist barriers around the world .
china can still tap new markets through efforts such as the “ belt and road initiative , ” but at a considerable cost .
ultimately , sustaining rapid growth requires continuing to move up the global value chain , by implementing further economic reforms and focusing on new technologies .
the chinese government ’s 13th five-year plan ( 2016-2020 ) reflected its commitment to market allocation of resources and lowering the costs of doing business .
and in 2015 , the authorities ’ “ made in china 2025 ” and “ internet plus ” initiatives signaled a determination to take the country ’s manufacturing base into the internet age .
the iea expects that each of the 195 million people with off-grid solar will get just 170kwh per year – or half of what one us flat-screen tv uses in a year .
perhaps not surprisingly , the first rigorous test published on the impact of solar panels on the lives of poor people found that while they got a little more electricity , there was no measurable impact on their lives : they did not increase savings or spending , they did not work more or start more businesses , and their children did not study more .
little wonder : 170kwh is not what most of us would consider real access to electricity .
off-grid energy at this level will never power a factory or a farm , so it can not reduce poverty or create jobs .
and it will not help fight the world ’s biggest environmental killer : indoor air pollution , which is mostly caused by open fires fueled by wood , cardboard , and dung , and claims 3.8 million lives annually .
from 1990 to 2010 , death and disability from ncds in low-income countries increased 300 % faster than the rate of decline in infectious diseases .
some of the same factors at work in the recent ebola outbreak drive the high rates of ncds .
inhabitants of densely packed urban areas in emerging economies often face both indoor and outdoor pollution , and are less likely to have access to adequate nutrition .
most health systems in these countries are not built for chronic or preventive care and lack basic consumer protections .
from 1970 to 2000 , cigarette consumption tripled in developing countries .
rather , politics itself has become operationally dysfunctional .
when citizens and politicians come to regard politics as a zero-sum game , and resort to brinkmanship and other bad-faith tactics , malaise sets in .
both european and american debates have been replete with posturing and tests of will , turning politics into a game of “ chicken . ”
in chicken , two drivers race toward a cliff ( or toward each other ) ; the loser is the first driver to swerve away in the face of imminent catastrophe .
but if neither driver concedes , both are destroyed .
political institutions have not kept pace with technological change and the resulting growth in markets .
when ordinary egyptians , having organized themselves via social media , rallied in cairo ’s tahrir square and toppled former president hosni mubarak in 2011 , it seemed that technology would necessarily boost democracy .
but it soon became clear that these digital platforms could easily be co-opted by authoritarian governments or terrorists , and used to spread false news , influence electoral processes , and create deep divisions and confusion in societies .
in the business world , global corporations ’ quasi-monopoly and monopsony power , and their ability to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions , continues to allow them to largely escape the purview of national regulators and governments , despite g20-sponsored work to prevent corporate-base erosion and profit shifting .
and biotechnology will pose huge challenges , as human cloning and genetic screening enable parents to “ choose ” embryos with desired characteristics .
addressing the panoply of other problems confronting the us will require more federal revenues , not less .
increases in standards of living , for example , are the result of technological innovation , which in turn depends on basic research .
but federal government support of research as a percentage of gdp is now at a level comparable to what it was 60 years ago .
while trump the candidate criticized the growth of us national debt , he now proposes tax cuts that would add trillions to the debt in just the next ten years – not the “ only ” $ 1.5 trillion that republicans claim would be added , thanks to some growth miracle that leads to more tax revenues .
yet the key lesson of ronald reagan ’s “ voodoo ” supply-side economics has not changed : tax cuts like these do not lead to faster growth , but only to lower revenues .
while it will presumably lack the public option many of us prefer , this is still a real achievement .
the same middle-of-the-road approach can be taken in the second year to address the still-outstanding fiscal issues .
obama can use his state of the union message to flesh out a bipartisan strategy for narrowing the budget deficit to sustainable levels .
this would entail reinstating pay-as-you-go rules and establishing an independent commission to submit to congress amendment-proof ( and filibuster-proof ) recommendations for tax and expenditure reform .
but obama needs to provide stronger leadership on financial reform , where , as with health care , there is a welter of conflicting proposals .
warsaw – poland has now emerged as the latest european battleground in a contest between two models of democracy – liberal and illiberal .
the overwhelming election victory in october of jarosław kaczyński ’s far-right law and justice party ( pis ) has led to something more akin to regime change than to a routine turnover of democratically elected governments .
prime minister beata szydło ’s new administration has purged the civil service ( including public radio and television ) , packed the constitutional court with sympathizers , and weakened the court ’s capacity to strike down legislation .
in response , the european commission has launched an official inquiry into potential violations of the eu ’s rule-of-law standards .
moreover , standard & poor ’s has , for the first time , downgraded poland ’s foreign currency rating – from a - to bbb + – and warned of perhaps more cuts to come as it accuses the government of weakening “ the independence and effectiveness of key institutions . ”
furthermore , in the shiite tradition , the strategy of the mahdi , the shiite messiah , will be to intimidate all his enemies upon his return to earth .
but cultivating fear in others also makes one more susceptible to fear , and nothing is more frightening to khamenei and the leaders of the islamic republic than the social dynamism unleashed by the democratic movement brewing inside the country .
the regime seems convinced that there is only a small likelihood of a military attack on its nuclear program .
it does not believe that sanctions can bring about its collapse .
thus , external forces do not appear to pose much of a threat .
for their own political reasons , the british put the sunni arabs – never more than 25 % of the population – in control of the whole country , and even imported a sunni arab hashemite prince to rule over their creation .
ever since , the country could be held together only by an iron fist : iraq ’s history is replete with shia , kurdish , and even christian assyrian revolts , all put down in bloody fashion by the ruling sunni minority .
throughout its history , modern iraq has always been the most oppressive of the arab countries .
saddam ’s rule was only the most brutal in a long line of sunni regimes .
it was this sunni hegemony – and not merely that of saddam ’s ba’athist regime – that was toppled by the united states .
proteins that retain the same function across very different species – generally the case with orthologs – are expected to keep the same fold .
but the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein chains in these orthologs can vary significantly .
sometimes the extent of sequence identity between two orthologs can be as low as 25-30 % , and yet their folds remain strikingly similar , attesting to the robustness of function to evolutionary change .
this conservation of the protein fold across species makes the origin of our complexity even more puzzling , as it is well known that the number of human genes is deceptively small , merely one order of magnitude larger than that of , say , rice .
if the structure of the proteins is conserved across species , where is our complexity coming from ?
georgia 's current economic collapse provides little incentive for either of these self-proclaimed independent republics to support reunification .
similarly , georgia 's inability to manage relations with its only autonomous republic , adzharia , does n't inspire much confidence .
the adzhar people consider themselves georgians , but still have frequent squabbles with the central government , so how could ethnically distinct abkhazia and south ossetia feel assured that their relations with georgia would work out any better ?
president saakashvili seems to understand the necessity of reviving georgia 's moribund economy , which requires , first and foremost , political stability .
but he is unlikely to refrain from accusing russia of stoking tensions with abkhazia and south ossetia .
moreover , the scots , welsh , and irish have come to see eu membership as a safeguard against english political revanchism .
as in the past , imperialism aspires for unity , but comes with divisive side effects .
brexiteer fantasies of a global britain focus squarely on english national identity , while diluting those of the scottish , northern irish , and welsh , who would return to serving as junior partners in a far less magnificent and rewarding english project .
although socioeconomic factors played some role in the outcome of the brexit referendum , the geographic breakdown tells the real story .
excluding london , which is a bastion of multi-ethnic cosmopolitanism , 55 % of voters in england supported leaving the eu , whereas 62 % of scots and 56 % of the northern irish voted to remain .
the paper made the case for developing alternatives to fossil fuels , ensuring that economic development does n’t wreak environmental havoc , and recognizing the importance of adaptation to climate change .
in the us , we witnessed an equally promising development in the climate debate just last month , when the conservative american enterprise institute , the liberal brookings institution , and the centrist breakthrough institute teamed up to publish a report that called for revamping america ’s energy system with the aim of making clean energy cheap .
entitled “ post-partisan power , ” the report comprehensively and convincingly argues that the us government should invest roughly $ 25 billion per year ( about 0.2 % of america ’s gdp ) in low-carbon military procurement , r & d , and a new network of university-private sector innovation hubs to create an “ energy revolution . ”
this sensible proposal predictably drew fire from committed “ alarmists ” and “ deniers . ”
but , promisingly – and surprisingly , given the somewhat toxic state of us politics – it attracted broad support and intelligent commentary from many mainstream pundits .
all four north african rulers have , to greater or lesser degrees , made themselves the center of highly opaque power structures .
everything in their countries depends on the person and family rather than the office .
yet , despite these authoritarian leaders ’ apparently solid grip on power , ensuring that a relative takes over is not as simple as it seems .
the problem boils down to overcoming possible resistance – from both the elite and the public – that could derail the handover or undermine the successor ’s authority .
dealing with elite interests requires ingenuity .
there seems to be almost universal agreement that he should , and international pressure is being applied on president kostunica to comply .
but the decision may have life-and-death ramifications for serbia ’s future .
many who agree that milosevic is a war criminal now think that we should listen to the voices coming from belgrade and their cry that milosevic should face trial before his own people .
ultimate moral responsibility for what was done by milosevic rests with serbia ’s people .
they brought him to power , albeit not in a way that conforms precisely with democratic norms ; they supported him , even when he led them into genocidal crimes and to defeat after defeat .
for starters , we are again moving into what henry kissinger called the realm of “ constructive ambiguity . ”
palestinians have been assured via a message from president barack obama , delivered by his special envoy george mitchell , that the israelis will not carry out any “ provocations ” during the coming four months of indirect negotiations .
pressed to clarify , the palestinians admitted that there is no written promise to this effect .
but , on a recent trip to israel , white house adviser dan shapiro is said to have been reassured that the israelis will not embarrass their american friends .
in exchange , shapiro handed the ultra-orthodox leader of israel ’s shas party an invitation to the white house .
to be sure , in the short term , some authoritarian modernizers ( for example , singapore ’s lee kuan yew ) serve their countries better than democratically elected leaders ( for example , italy ’s silvio berlusconi ) .
in the long run , however , democracies benefit from intrinsic self-correction mechanisms that are absent in autocracies , where often-inadequate leaders cling to power .
indeed , for every lee kuan yew , there are many authoritarian non-modernizers , like zimbabwe ’s robert mugabe or uzbekistan ’s islam karimov .
the chinese model combines some of the authoritarian modernization model ’s advantages – centralized power , quick decision-making , insulation from populism , and a superior ability to implement painful but necessary reforms – with leadership turnover by de-personalizing political struggle .
after all , china ’s rulers are driven primarily by a desire to keep the party , not any individual , in power .
the dilution of glass-steagall , and its ultimate repeal in 1999 , allowed banks to engage in so-called “ proprietary trading ” – enabling them to use depositors ’ savings to trade for their own account , mainly in risky mortgage-backed securities .
but the obama administration must go further than prohibiting proprietary trading by commercial banks and do two further things .
first , capital requirements should be tripled – not just in the us , but across the g-20 – so that banks hold at least 20-25 % of assets in core capital .
that way , shareholders rather than regulators would play the leading role in making banks behave sensibly .
second , if banks are “ too big to fail , ” they must be shrunk , so that taxpayers do not need to bail them out every time a crisis erupts .
and make no mistake : the agreement is , on the whole , a good thing .
its collapse would trigger a nuclear arms race in the world ’s most unstable region .
iran ’s bitterest regional enemy , saudi arabia , would move rapidly toward a nuclear capability , using abundant petrodollars and pakistani knowhow .
others – turkey , kuwait , egypt , and algeria – would not be far behind .
to bet that these countries , having acquired such weapons , would behave responsibly would be a high-risk gamble .
the concert itself offered layer upon layer of significance .
the germany of beethoven has been reborn on the ashes of the germany of hitler .
germany today is a globally admired , peace-loving , war-abhorring , democratic , prosperous , innovative , and cooperative country .
at the same time , beethoven ’s genius belongs not only to his native germany , or even to the west , but to all of humanity .
his scoring of schiller ’s poetic ode reflects the truly global aspirations of the enlightenment .
instead , up to now at least , the government has mostly been providing ( high-interest ) loans rather than engaging in massive equity buyouts .
nor have the oligarchs been bailed out .
of $ 50 billion in external debt owed by russian banks and firms in 2008 , the government refinanced only $ 10 billion .
apparently , the terms offered by the government ( libor +5 % and collateral ) have turned out to be right on target .
how did reasonable economic policies prevail in this crisis ?
washington , dc – as chinese president xi jinping ’s first summit with us president donald trump takes place at trump ’s luxurious florida estate mar-a-lago , at least part of the discussion will invariably focus on one of the world ’s most impoverished places : north korea .
despite more than two decades of on-again , off-again negotiations , north korea ’s nuclear weapons program is pushing the world toward a strategic watershed much like the one that the west faced 60 years ago , when the united states and the soviet union faced off against each other in europe .
the us and its allies successfully navigated the challenge of europe in the twentieth century without war .
but to achieve comparable success in east asia today , trump must persuade xi to adopt a different policy toward north korea .
when the us and the soviet union became rivals after world war ii , each had a way of deterring the other from attacking .
that is not an absurd idea .
there is a long and distinguished tradition of catholic social thought .
but taking these traditions seriously would require much larger transformations of capitalism than even avowed christian democrats are prepared to contemplate , including a much wider distribution of ownership and mechanisms for involving workers in management .
theories of “ red toryism ” might go some way in this direction , but it remains to be seen whether they will ever translate into practice .
for the moment , the temptation is for the european right to find its “ new look ” through a selective appeal to religion – and wait and see whether it works as an electoral strategy . they should remember , though , that starting a kulturkampf is to play with fire : it might be possible to instrumentalize religious passions for a time ; but such passions can not permanently be controlled from above .
fiscal sustainability requires an eventual rise in the consumption tax , and of course japan should not wait until international investors start doubting its willpower .
the problem is in the timing and tactics .
postponing the second consumption-tax increase seems like a good compromise between pushing abenomics to escape velocity and maintaining long-run credibility .
but this brings us back to japan ’s deeper problems .
demand policies alone will not alone prevent two more lost decades , much less guarantee two golden ones .
usually supine congressional republicans panicked and told trump and his team that his policy of tearing families apart could ruin their chances in november ’s midterm elections .
in fact , the policy of separating families was threatening to drive a wedge between trump and even his evangelical followers .
and they had been willing to overlook growing evidence of trump ’s sexual hijinks during his marriage to the first lady , melania ( including apparent payoffs to a porn star and others for silence ) , in exchange for policy influence and appointments of social conservatives to the supreme court and throughout the federal judiciary .
unusually for her , former first lady laura bush spoke out against the policy of taking children from their mothers .
one problem for trump is that he is obsessed with appearing “ strong . ”
but membership in the eu does not mean estrangement from russia .
besides , excluding ukraine from eventual eu membership will encourage russia 's imperial ambitions .
this will diminish russia 's chances of ever becoming a full democracy , for it can rule an empire only as a militarized state .
it is the mark of a good club that people clamor to become members .
an ever-larger eu including ukraine would create a political unit with a huge population , furthering the union 's ambitions to be a global power .
businesses were encouraged with government subsidies and loans .
schools and training centers were established .
within a few years , the refugees were absorbed into the economy and society of the southern , greek cypriot sector of the island .
as in post-world war ii west germany , much of the current prosperity in cyprus today is an outcome of the boost the economy received from the absorption of refugees .
anyone visiting the greek cypriot part of the island nowadays will not find refugee camps : most of the millions of tourists are unaware of the fact that more than a third of the greek cypriots they encounter are refugees or descendants of refugees .
in nigeria , astonishing economic growth , averaging 7 % per year since 2000 , may well have reduced poverty in the southwest of the country ; but in the northeast ( where the extremist group boko haram is most active ) , shocking levels of wealth inequality and poverty have emerged .
similar trends are apparent from china to egypt to greece .
alongside inequality , declining public trust fuels the revolt against globalization and democracy .
across the developed and developing worlds , many suspect that the rich are getting richer because they are not held to the same rules as everyone else .
it ’s not hard to see why .
russian officers , he reported , directly command large military operations in eastern ukraine , including the siege and capture of the important transport center of debaltseve in february .
but the threat posed by russia extends far beyond ukraine .
after all , russia is the one country with enough missiles and nuclear warheads to destroy the us .
as its economic and geopolitical influence has waned , so has its willingness to consider renouncing its nuclear status .
indeed , not only has it revived the cold war-era tactic of sending military aircraft unannounced into airspace over the baltic countries and the north sea ; it has also made veiled nuclear threats against countries like denmark .
as the franco-lebanese writer amin maalouf has said , it is “ better to err with hope , than to be right with despair . ”
contrary to what many democratic cassandras think , the worst is not inevitable .
authoritarians and populists have not yet triumphed , and in many places , democrats are fighting back .
or , to put it less optimistically , democracy and autocracy still have similar chances of decaying .
for now , it remains uncertain which model will prevail .
the prevailing answer is that one coerces bondholders to accept the deal “ voluntarily . ”
one could dismiss this dispute as being mere rhetoric .
but , using the talmudic logic , one can also show that there are mechanisms that can – and should – be used to place pressure on the parties in the interest of obtaining superior voluntary outcomes .
there are two preponderant interpretations of the talmudic passage .
one argues that coercion can change minds .
tokyo – with japan ’s economy struggling to escape its deflationary torpor , the economic-revitalization plan that prime minister shinzo abe launched in 2012 has come under growing scrutiny .
but japan ’s current travails , which have brought a concomitant decline in japan ’s stock market , stem from the yen ’s appreciation – 24 % over the last year – against major currencies .
“ abenomics ” – which included substantial monetary and fiscal expansion – has nothing to do with it .
since abenomics was introduced , japan ’s labor market has improved considerably : 1.5 million new jobs have been created , and the unemployment rate has fallen to just over 3 % .
moreover , corporate profits have soared , and tax revenues have increased by more than ¥ 20 trillion ( $ 188 billion ) .
milan – the worst of the financial/economic crisis seems to be over .
asset markets performed reasonably well in 2010 .
growth in the united states and parts of europe returned .
private-sector deleveraging continued , but was counter-balanced by rising public-sector deficits and debt .
and emerging-market growth returned to pre-crisis levels and appears to be sustainable , helped by unorthodox policies designed to “ sterilize ” massive capital inflows .
in a world of sovereign states , is it hypocritical for some to have nuclear weapons and deny them to others ?
if no one had the bomb today , it would be best if it were not invented .
but history depends on the paths that were taken in the past .
suppose it were 1939 , and states were debating whether the us should invent the bomb .
they might have argued that all should get it or none .
hong kong – china ’s transformation from a manufacturing-driven and export-led economy to one underpinned by services and domestic consumption is firmly underway .
and that ’s good news not just for china , but also for the future of the global economy .
the 2016-17 edition of the blue book of china ’s commercial sector by fung business intelligence and the chinese academy of social sciences maps the change .
china ’s retail markets reached cn ¥ 30 trillion ( $ 4.6 trillion ) in 2015 , after more than a decade of double-digit growth .
household consumption has begun to climb , even as the pace of investment has fallen , and now exceeds 60 % of gdp .
the global market for these stimulants is estimated at $ 65 billion .
part of the attraction of these synthetic drugs is that they are readily available , affordable , and convenient to use ( no need to shoot up , snort , or smoke ) .
amphetamines speed up the way the body works : users experience increased confidence , sociability , and energy .
this buzz is considered harmless : “ pills do not kill or spread hiv/aids , ” it is said .
but what goes up must come down .
attempts have been made ever since to systematically examine and document the environmental consequences of wars .
studies of the balkan wars and the many wars that consumed afghanistan during the 1990 's have been launched through international organisations like the united nations environment progam ( unep ) .
unfortunately , africa 's wars -- in congo , rwanda and burundi , liberia , sierre leone , and the ivory coast -- have not yet received the attention they require .
what have we learned about the environmental consequences of wars ?
first of all the effects depend upon the type of war and the type of environment .
paris – whoever wins september ’s parliamentary election in germany , the time has come once again for a major franco-german initiative .
regardless of their economic conditions or their confidence – or lack of it – in each other , france and germany are more than ever jointly responsible for the future , if not the very survival , of the european project .
are there alternatives to franco-german leadership of the european union ?
joining great britain with them in a club of three would be a good idea , but it is out of the question nowadays .
britain has largely excluded itself from any leadership role in europe .
upon returning to office this spring as prime minister , singh brought into government an experienced and internationally renowned team , including finance minister chidambaram , who served successfully as finance minister in the mid-1990 's , and dr. montek singh ahluwalia , who heads the planning commission , the key body assessing india 's medium-term public investment strategies .
when the former government lost the vote this past may , and singh 's government came into office , there were fears that singh would be hamstrung by left-wing coalition partners , who would demand that market reforms be dismantled as the price of their participation in the new ruling coalition .
chidambaram 's 2004/2005 budget puts those fears to rest .
the document is a brilliant lesson in development economics : it shows how to combine a full-speed ahead approach to market reforms with urgently needed attention to poverty .
in short , the budget is a model for all developing countries .
and such fears can have severe consequences .
for example , the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on the ukrainian and russian economies might ultimately be behind the recent war there .
according to the international monetary fund , both ukraine and russia experienced spectacular growth from 2002 to 2007 : over those five years , real per capita gdp rose 52 % in ukraine and 46 % in russia .
that is history now : real per capita gdp growth was only 0.2 % last year in ukraine , and only 1.3 % in russia .
the discontent generated by such disappointment may help to explain ukrainian separatists ’ anger , russians ’ discontent , and russian president vladimir putin ’s decision to annex crimea and to support the separatists .
which measures can ensure the eu ’s global competitiveness ?
how can we narrow the existing differences in development and material welfare within europe ?
fourth , the eu ’s aspiration for a common foreign and security policy must be addressed .
the threats facing the world today are supranational , so counteracting them must be supranational , too .
but this is impossible without a clear european identity – and thus a common interest to be asserted and defended .
barcelona – after world war i , when millions of european civilians were made refugees , forced out of their homelands by enemy occupation or deportation , an international regime was developed to coordinate effective responses and ease the suffering of those who had been uprooted .
a century later , another refugee crisis is underway , and this time , it is europe that has the power to provide safe haven to desperate people .
yet it has not risen to the occasion , with many of its responses failing to match the urgency of the situation .
in just the first few months of 2015 , more than 38,000 people have attempted to reach europe by crossing the mediterranean from north africa .
some 1,800 people have died as a result – more than twice the number of such deaths in all of 2013 .
for example , us sanctions eventually brought iran to the table to negotiate a nuclear deal ; but sanctions were effective only because a broad international coalition , ultimately backed by the united nations security council , isolated iran financially .
us sanctions against russia after the latter ’s annexation of crimea in 2014 were amplified by a coincidental oil-price drop , and by the deployment of similar measures by the european union , russia ’s largest trading partner .
without eu participation , us sanctions would have been far less effective .
but , while international coalitions lend credibility to us sanctions , they are fragile and temporary at best .
just a year after the iran deal was reached , it is already hard to imagine that china or russia would back further joint action against iran , even if the agreement began to unravel .
india ’s state-run oil and natural gas corporation ( ongc videsh ) produces sudanese oil , and over the next two years indian diplomatic missions will open in mali , gabon , niger , and burkina faso .
until 2003 , the indian foreign ministry had a single africa division ; it now has three : west and central africa , east and southern africa , and west asia and north africa .
a study by the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry identified five main sectors that can act as “ engines of growth ” to boost indo-africa trade : pharmaceuticals and the health sector , information technology , water management , food processing , and education .
nigeria is india ’s largest trading partner in africa .
bilateral annual trade turnover exceeds $ 3 billion , with oil constituting more than 96 % of indian imports from nigeria .
former israeli foreign minister shlomo ben-ami has recently outlined a new peace paradigm for the negotiations between israel and palestine , in which the participation of actors like the european union , russia , and key arab countries would facilitate the rise of a truly international solution .
this paradigm should be extended to the geneva negotiations on the syrian civil war , with countries like saudi arabia , iran , turkey , and egypt assuming a greater role .
of course , involving regional powers could complicate already-muddy negotiations further .
the goal must therefore be clarity and equilibrium .
only with a balanced negotiation process , guided by regional and global actors , can a stable balance of power in the middle east be achieved .
milan – the word “ openness ” has two related but distinct connotations .
it can mean that something is unrestricted , accessible , and possibly vulnerable ; or it can mean that something , such as a person or institution , is transparent , as opposed to secretive .
the first meaning is often applied to trade , investment , and technology ( though most definitions do not match opportunity with vulnerability ) , which have always driven structural economic changes , especially with respect to employment .
structural change can be simultaneously beneficial and disruptive .
and policymakers have long had to strike a balance between the abstract principle of openness and concrete measures to limit the worst effects of change .
faced with this unfortunate reality , the fed tried to support growth in indirect , experimental ways .
by injecting liquidity using multiple means , it raised financial asset prices well above what the economy ’s fundamentals warranted .
the fed hoped that this would make certain segments of the population ( asset holders ) feel richer , enticing them to spend more and encouraging companies to invest more .
but such “ wealth effects ” and “ animal spirits ” proved quite feeble .
so the fed felt compelled to do more of the same , which led to a host of unintended consequences and risks of collateral damage that i discussed in some detail in my book the only game in town .
what remains unaddressed is the root cause of abnormal brain activations .
we are pursuing three intertwined ideas .
the first is based on studies suggesting that schizophrenia patients suffer from reduced brain connectivity .
as a result , certain groups of neurons , such as those responsible for producing and perceiving language , may begin to function autonomously , beyond the control or influence of other brain systems .
it is as if the string section of the orchestra suddenly decided to play its own music , disregarding everyone else .
i have seen shrinking glaciers in antarctica and the andes .
i have seen the effects of deforestation in the brazilian amazon and the loss of biodiversity .
the very existence of some caribbean countries , including portions of trinidad and tobago , could be threatened if sea levels rise .
but bold , visionary leadership will be needed to seal a successor deal to the kyoto protocol in copenhagen later this year .
the agreement reached there must be ambitious , effective , and fair , offering rich countries a way to cut greenhouse-gas emissions while supporting poorer countries as they adapt to the adverse impact of climate change .
since the 1990 ’s , thousands of chinese officials have traveled to singapore to learn from its experience .
while singapore ’s political system could not readily be transferred to a huge country like china , it constitutes a model that has helped to shape china ’s recent move toward meritocracy .
indeed , following singapore ’s example , china has developed a sophisticated and comprehensive system for selecting and promoting political leaders that involves decades of training and a battery of exams for officials at various stages of their careers .
these meritocratically selected leaders have overseen an economic boom that has lifted several hundred million people out of poverty .
at the same time , however , problems like corruption , inequality , environmental degradation , official corruption , and repression of political dissent and religious expression have worsened .
today , it appears , there is nothing left of franco-american goodwill .
relations between the two allies have entered one of those periods of tension which have flared many times since world war ii 's close .
the united states vetoed reelection , advocated by france , of un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali , arguing that it wanted to " enlarge the role " of the general secretary in reforming the world body .
( on both sides this spat was rather paradoxical , if one remembers that de gaulle wanted to diminish as much as possible the powers of the un , to which he contemptuously referred to as a " thingamajig " , and that america owes over a billion dollars in past due contributions to the un . )
at the same time , washington does n't even want to hear any talk about conferring on a european , as france demands , command of the allied fleet in the mediterranean .
freer trade across borders reduces income disparities .
the 2015 white house report , for example , found that a ten-percentage-point decrease in tariffs leads to a one-percentage-point drop in the wage gap between men and women , and that lowering tariffs also reduces wage gaps based on race and immigration status .
moreover , increased openness to trade is associated with lower rates of infant mortality and higher life expectancy , especially in developing countries .
over time , free trade enables workers to shift to more efficient industries , resulting in higher wages , increased investment in infrastructure , and a more dynamic economy .
most powerful of all , free trade underpins economic growth , which means millions more people lifted out of poverty .
but hong kong ’s advantages are now at risk , largely due to its own insecurities .
as several commentators have pointed out , mainland china ’s remarkable economic growth and development in recent decades has eroded hong kong ’s leading position as a center for finance , logistics , and trade .
in 1997 , hong kong handled half of china ’s foreign trade , and its gdp amounted to nearly one-fifth of china ’s .
it far outperformed shanghai – mainland china ’s most prosperous city – in terms of gdp , per capita income , and shipping volume .
today , hong kong accounts for just one-eighth of china ’s trade .
the alternatives available for the eu is either to see the uk to leave its customs union , or to keep the uk in , by making a political commitment to take british interests into account .
from a long-term perspective , the latter is preferable .
finally , remaining in the eu customs union would make it possible to avoid reestablishing a hard border between the uk and the republic of ireland after brexit .
though may has agreed that avoiding a hard border should be part of any deal , she has offered only vague suggestions concerning how that could actually be achieved .
brexit is , and will remain , a lose-lose proposition .
the search for the essential traits of a leader dominated the field of leadership studies until the late 1940 ’s , and remains common in popular discourse today .
a tall handsome person enters a room , draws attention , and “ looks like a leader . ”
various studies show that tall men are often favored , and that corporate ceos are taller than average .
but some of the most powerful leaders in history , such as napoleon , stalin , and deng xiaoping were little over five feet tall .
the traits-centered approach has not vanished from studies of leadership , but it has been broadened and made more flexible .
globalization , which can be defined as interdependence at inter-continental distances , is as old as human history .
witness the migration of peoples and religions , or trade along the ancient silk route that connected medieval europe and asia .
but globalization today is different , because it is becoming quicker and thicker .
after the first trans-atlantic cable in 1868 , europe and america could communicate in a minute .
in 1919 , the economist john maynard keynes described the possibility of an englishman in london using a telephone to order goods from around the world to be delivered to his house by the afternoon .
for example , an endowment or pension fund might consider basing its payout decisions more on long-run , potential shock-adjusted average returns than on a simple weighted average of past returns or end-period asset values ( the normal practice now ) .
of course , you can argue that post-crisis regulatory reform will eventually resolve the problem of periodic systemic risk , and that we will return to the more comfortable world of relatively stationary risk without periodic imbalances .
but i would not bet on this happening .
the historical evidence suggests that systemic risk is persistent and resistant to regulatory efforts to eliminate it .
financial innovation will proceed along with regulatory arbitrage .
either technology will depend on a national electricity grid that uses low-emission forms of power generation , such as wind , solar , nuclear , or coal-fired plants that capture and store the carbon-dioxide emissions .
all of these technologies will require public funding alongside private investment .
third , the us recovery will not be credible unless there is also a strategy for getting the government ’s own finances back in order .
george w. bush ’s idea of economic policy was to cut taxes three times while boosting spending on war .
the result is a massive budget deficit , which will expand to gargantuan proportions in the coming year ( perhaps $ 1 trillion ) under the added weight of recession , bank bailouts , and short-term fiscal stimulus measures .
according to the 2005 declaration of principles of international election observations , credible monitoring requires that five criteria be met .
first , the observers must be autonomous – financially and otherwise – in their relationship to the host country .
second , observers must be granted unrestricted access to all aspects and phases of the election process , as well as to all of the technologies involved .
third , observers must face no restrictions in meeting with all authorities and political actors .
fourth , observers must not be subject to any pressure or threat of retaliation by any government authority .
they should be safe , too , and reasonably comfortable .
they should run not only on time , but at the right time and at reasonable intervals .
more important still , they should be affordable .
as the list of criteria grows longer , it becomes evident that the most easily measured component , punctuality , is but one of many desirable features , and not necessarily the most significant .
this example is relevant for the politics of public services , which dominates debate in many countries because it lies at the heart of the big problems of both government budgets ( and cutting them back ) and taxes ( and their reduction ) .
we saw helicopters attempt aerial drops ; landing is impossible in most places .
but people told us that they often miss and the supplies land up thousands of feet or below in deep forests .
distribution is haphazard and uncoordinated , done with little thought .
we saw relief workers throw packets of food and clothes from the top of trucks , causing a riot .
hustlers thrive , the weak watch passively .
for example , in carrying out the manhattan project ( to produce the atomic bomb during world war ii ) and the first moon landing , the us government set a remarkable technological goal , established a bold timetable , and committed the financial resources needed to get the job done .
in both cases , the scientists and engineers delivered on time .
the example of atomic bombs might seem an unpleasant one , yet it raises an important question : if we ask governments and scientists to cooperate on war technology , should n’t we do at least the same to save the planet from carbon pollution ?
in fact , the process of “ directed technological change , ” in which bold objectives are set , milestones are identified , and timelines are put into place , is much more common than many realize .
the information-technology revolution that has brought us computers , smart phones , gps , and much more , was built on a series of industry and government roadmaps .
but anti-americanism is simply irrational for russia , which only stands to gain from an alliance with the world 's economic and political leader .
of course , good relations with europe are a priority for russia , especially economic links , human contacts , and social interactions .
russia will also benefit from an active foreign-policy engagement with the eu 's leading members .
but a strategic alliance with the eu in foreign and security policies remains unrealistic and inefficient .
europe will most likely continue to grow weaker , rather than stronger , in this field .
and with the emergence of new diseases such as zika – and the revival of old foes like bubonic plague – there is no question that much of humanity remains at the mercy of biology .
moreover , globalization has compounded the danger by facilitating the spread of communicable diseases .
a flu outbreak like that of 1918-1920 , which killed between 50 and 100 million people , would be even more devastating today .
to prevent such catastrophic outcomes , we need a comprehensive approach for strengthening health-care delivery in low - and middle-income countries .
in particular , these countries need help improving drug delivery and managing chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes , which impose an immense burden on their economies .
and , if there are to be wealth taxes , instituting them now to take effect only in the future – and only if inequality becomes much worse – would preempt the perception that the rules had been changed after the game had ended .
the advantage of income-tax increases is that they could be based not just on current income , but on some average of income over the course of years , and could allow deductions for investments , thus sharing some features with wealth taxes without penalizing those who saved more to accumulate more wealth .
moreover , a long-term plan legislated by one or a few countries today , before any substantial impact on actual tax payments occurs , could help to promote an international dialogue about appropriate future policy toward inequality .
that would create room for a more uniform tax response among countries , thus reducing the ability of the super-rich to evade taxation by switching location .
piketty ’s book makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the dynamics of contemporary inequality .
many spent years in jail for daring to speak out against china , and as i grew older , i vowed to speak out , too .
my first stint in a chinese prison was tied to work i began in the early 2000s printing and distributing tibetan-language books .
i considered these texts to be important readings on tibetan politics , culture , and religion .
chinese authorities , however , viewed them as a challenge to their rule , and they punished me accordingly .
as the 2008 olympics approached , i began looking for new ways to record my people ’s history .
warsaw – massive protests in warsaw have made headlines around the world in recent weeks .
poles are demonstrating against legislation enacted by the ruling law and justice ( pis ) party that would lower the retirement age of supreme court justices , effectively forcing out all judges over the age of 65 and allowing the pis to pack the court with its own tame justices .
the polish constitution provides for an independent judiciary , and sets the term for the first president of the supreme court at six years .
that means judges can not be removed by legislation – at least not constitutionally .
yet the new law enables polish president andrzej duda to replace up to three-fifths of the supreme court ’s justices , including the chief justice , in 2018 alone .
back in his radical days , ken livingstone , the former mayor of london , famously quipped that if voting changed anything , they would abolish it .
it turns out that in latin america , elections really do shake things up .
the latest proof : mauricio funes , the standard bearer of the fmln – until not long ago a marxist guerilla movement – has just prevailed in el salvador ’s presidential election .
this is remarkable in a country that for as long as anyone remembers has been ruled , by hook or by crook , by a reactionary oligarchy .
if the salvadoran left ’s close electoral victory is peacefully accepted – as it has been so far – it means that latin america has truly come a long way .
the economist friedrich hayek put it well in 1945 :
“ [ t ] here is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which can not possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules : the knowledge of particular circumstances and place .
it is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others in that he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made , but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation . ”
the problem is that the promise of genuine “ unique information ” comes with the reality of vulnerability to deception .
that ’s why channeling dispersed knowledge into new businesses requires a regulatory framework that favors the genuinely enlightened and honest .
perhaps the only people not suddenly depressed are those immersed in the negotiations .
with more than a thousand points still to be agreed , all the policymakers i ’ve spoken to recently say that they can not see how a meaningful deal can be reached by december in copenhagen .
in reality , everyone is gearing up behind the scenes for a “ copenhagen 2 , ” and what those involved in the negotiations are calling “ an even greater slog . ”
even if some sort of communiqué is cobbled together in december – and countries with elections coming up , such as the united kingdom , will push for one – it is hard to believe that it will contain sufficient detail or reflect the proper level of commitment to have the impact so desperately needed .
“ copenhagen 1 ” was always bound to fail , partly because – and this may sound strange at first – it is all about climate change .
more people are arriving at the same conclusion , and those of us who have been championing evs as one of the solutions to climate change are optimistic that a tipping point is approaching .
sales of electric cars have increased dramatically in recent years ; some 750,000 were registered in 2016 – nearly half in china .
still , it is human nature to resist change , and many prospective buyers remain hesitant .
that is why addressing consumption bias must be the highest priority over the next few years .
several changes are needed to ensure that growth in ev usage and sales continues .
a focus on preferential agreements would fragment the global trading system , rather than integrating it .
the gradual marginalization of the wto would also erode its credibility in fulfilling its key role as adjudicator of trade disputes .
the success of the wto ’s adjudication system is reflected in its widespread acceptance .
even when wto decisions have had serious negative effects on a trading partner , they have generally been accepted .
this constitutes a remarkable advance in global governance .
the energy market – most importantly , the market for natural gas – and the market for tourist rentals were liberalized , and the process for acquiring an investment license was streamlined .
all of this has been accomplished in the face of fierce criticism from the opposition parties , especially those that governed greece during the last 30 years and thus are responsible for driving it to ruin .
it is as if they can not understand how reforms can help restart an economy with deep structural problems .
now that the greek government has delivered on its part of the bailout deal , it is time that its european and international counterparts conclude the first review of the program .
this will allow the government to proceed to the second stage : coping with skyrocketing unemployment and putting the economy back on the path to growth .
madrid – tackling climate change is a monumental challenge , but the leader of the foremost global power continues to wash his hands of the matter .
at the beginning of november , us president donald trump gave official notice of america ’s withdrawal from the paris climate agreement , thus confirming a decision he had announced in 2017 .
the notification came as soon as the agreement allowed , and the withdrawal will become effective the day after the us presidential election in november 2020 .
the united states will thus become the only country in the world that is not party to the pact .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
for starters , it is a real stretch to bemoan the state of corporate earnings in the us .
commerce department statistics show that after-tax corporate profits ( technically , after-tax profits from current production , adjusted for inventory and depreciation-accounting distortions ) stood at a solid 9.7 % of national income in the third quarter of 2016 .
while that is down from the 11 % peak hit in 2012 – owing to tepid economic growth , which typically puts pressure on profit margins – it hardly attests to a chronic earnings problem .
far from anemic , the current gdp share of after-tax profits is well above the post-1980 average of 7.6 % .
trends in corporate taxes , which stood at just 3.5 % of national income in the third quarter of 2016 , support a similar verdict .
the widespread prescription of drugs for troubled minds has always ended badly , right back to the days of opiates and cocaine , up through bromides , barbiturates , and tranquilizers : all proved to be highly addictive drugs , but only after years of denial did doctors admit that this was so .
now anti-depressants -- global brands with household names -- are the problem .
the past decade has seen a three-fold increase in prescriptions .
in england , prescriptions of anti-depressants now match valium at its peak in 1979 .
it is now clear that today 's anti-depressants are not the wonder drugs they were touted as being .
the best outcome , of course , is for chavez to shift the economy in to a less exposed external position with a large ( 50 % at least ) depreciation .
most high-unemployment economies have shown little feedback from currency collapse into inflation .
in venezuela , with unemployment at 20 % , the same is expected .
of course , such measures will be unpopular with labor and the right response here is to eliminate large taxes on wages so that money wages can rise without an offsetting decline in competitiveness .
in the budget this is paid for by the favorable effect of devaluation on government oil revenues .
washington , dc – millions of the world ’s poorest people face serious water-related challenges – from lack of access and shortages to disputes over supplies – with profound implications for security , economic development , and environmental sustainability .
as world leaders design a development agenda to succeed the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , which expire in 2015 , addressing these issues should be a top priority .
consider this : almost one billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water , and 2.5 billion people lack adequate sanitation .
the costs are staggering : thousands of child deaths every day , and annual economic losses estimated at $ 260 billion – more than double the total amount of official development assistance .
making matters worse , climate change will render water supplies more unpredictable , with increasingly frequent and intense floods and droughts imposing significant human and economic costs and impeding development in poor countries .
but all public actors , not just the police , must respond to urban problems .
first and foremost , mayors should be mobilized as mediators , because they are on the front line in implementing urban policy .
when these policies fail , citizens hold mayors responsible .
but mayors are also the most knowledgeable about communication links within their communities , and are thus the most capable of organizing effective partnerships to address and resolve local issues .
the events in france also point to the need , at the european level , to reinforce policies against discrimination and that promote social equality .
the us example , the only full employment economy in the world , demonstrates that it can .
the welfare state is also being undermined .
in america , time on welfare is now limited and people who have not worked for years suddenly must do so .
in europe , however , unemployment remains a " good " job .
replacement of earnings via unemployment compensation ( after tax adjustments ) hits 70 % and up .
zurich – repeatedly in recent years there have been calls for a revival of civilian nuclear power .
yet that renaissance never seems to come .
indeed , of the more than 200 countries in the world , only 30 use nuclear power .
in july 2010 , a total of 439 nuclear power plants with a net installed capacity of 373.038 gw ( e ) were connected to various national electricity grids , about 1.2 gw ( e ) more than at the beginning of 2006 .
roughly 16 % of total energy needs ( up to 25 % in the highly industrialized countries ) are now met by electric energy .
denver – the united states constitution , which turned 225 years old last summer , is a remarkable document : the provisions of a text written in the eighteenth century continue to guide twenty-first-century governance .
we will be reminded of the implications of that in the coming weeks , as president barack obama fills senior positions in his second-term administration .
in many cases , the process will not be pretty .
article ii of the constitution stipulates presidential powers that require the “ advice and consent of the senate , ” including the nomination of senior officials .
probably nobody , 225 years ago , had any idea that the number of officials deemed to require senate confirmation would eventually exceed 1,400 , or that senate confirmation would involve a vetting process that often takes years to complete .
a key dimension of the current standoff over ukraine is energy , and it raises the same question about european solidarity .
as a recent study by bruegel has shown , the eu as a whole could , with some effort , dispense with gas imports from russia .
but doing so would require eu member states to regard security of supplies as a matter of common concern , not as an issue that each country must address on its own .
for example , in response to an embargo affecting a particular country , other eu members would draw on their reserves , increase their own production , pay more for imports , or cut consumption a bit .
but this sense of solidarity has been consistently lacking in the eu ’s energy-policy debate .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
the department of justice under president donald trump appears to be continuing the tradition .
no one is surprised that trump himself is deploying every orwellian device at his disposal to thwart the current impeachment inquiry in the house of representatives .
hypothetically , switching off the lights for an hour would cut co2 emissions from power plants around the world .
but , even if everyone in the entire world cut all residential lighting , and this translated entirely into co2 reduction , it would be the equivalent of china pausing its co2 emissions for less than four minutes .
in fact , earth hour will cause emissions to increase .
as the united kingdom ’s national grid operators have found , a small decline in electricity consumption does not translate into less energy being pumped into the grid , and therefore will not reduce emissions .
moreover , during earth hour , any significant drop in electricity demand will entail a reduction in co2 emissions during the hour , but it will be offset by the surge from firing up coal or gas stations to restore electricity supplies afterwards .
the institute ’s work seems to center on devices that read brain activity .
but it also apparently oversees all kinds of construction projects on a vast plot of land adjacent to the headquarters of the federal security service ( fsb ) – the kgb ’s successor organization – and the federal protective service .
if we keep following the scientific-money trail , we arrive at the prestigious russian academy of sciences ( ran ) , which held elections last week .
after the organization ’s 2013 elections , in which the kremlin-backed candidates for membership did not perform well , the government announced major reforms , including a three-year moratorium on ran elections .
it was then decided that , to ensure “ fairness , ” the government would approve all candidates , despite the fact that they are academics .
so , instead of providing context , depth , and analysis , newspapers are blasting out headlines that stimulate prurience or outrage .
the result has been disturbing , to put it mildly .
the airing of opinions is the cheapest way to fill a broadcast hour ; ranting anchors score the highest trps .
this reinforces the motivation to engage in sensational speculation , however baseless , as has occurred in sridevi ’s case .
more fundamentally , the rush to beat tv by breaking stories has weakened journalists ’ incentive to perform due diligence , in terms of researching stories and verifying claims .
washington , dc -- informed opinion is sharply divided about how the next 12 months will play out for the global economy .
those focused on emerging markets are emphasizing accelerating growth , with some forecasts projecting a 5 % increase in world output .
others , concerned about problems in europe and the united states , remain more pessimistic , with growth projections closer to 4 % – and some are even inclined to see a possible “ double dip ” recession .
this is an interesting debate , but it misses the bigger picture .
in response to the crisis of 2007-2009 , governments in most industrialized countries put in place some of the most generous bailouts ever seen for large financial institutions .
one puzzling and often overlooked feature of the france that elected nicolas sarkozy as its new president , and that is now poised to give his political allies a powerful parliamentary mandate , is its mix of private optimism and public pessimism .
consider this : france has the highest fertility rate in the european union ( just under two children per woman ) , even ahead of booming ireland .
of course , that rate alone is not enough to sustain france ’s current population , but it ’s far stronger than its european neighbors and almost equal to that of the us .
yet , despite this , eurobarometer polls repeatedly show that the french are the most pessimistic of all europeans when it comes to their country ’s future .
how can it be that people who are so negative about their common future as a nation go about confidently building their private futures within their families ?
new york – the reception in the united states , and in other advanced economies , of thomas piketty ’s recent book capital in the twenty-first century attests to growing concern about rising inequality .
his book lends further weight to the already overwhelming body of evidence concerning the soaring share of income and wealth at the very top .
piketty ’s book , moreover , provides a different perspective on the 30 or so years that followed the great depression and world war ii , viewing this period as a historical anomaly , perhaps caused by the unusual social cohesion that cataclysmic events can stimulate .
in that era of rapid economic growth , prosperity was widely shared , with all groups advancing , but with those at the bottom seeing larger percentage gains .
piketty also sheds new light on the “ reforms ” sold by ronald reagan and margaret thatcher in the 1980s as growth enhancers from which all would benefit .
this fall in gdp , though a natural consequence of lower imports of consumption goods , is often mistakenly perceived as something to be avoided , because it seems to imply that output is below its “ potential . ”
in a completely flexible economy , this drop in measured gdp ( and the concomitant increase in unemployment ) could be avoided if the resources formerly employed in selling imported consumer goods could quickly be used to generate exports .
but retail shop clerks and car dealers can not be easily transformed into the specialized and highly skilled workers needed in modern manufacturing .
in the case of greece and portugal , for example , the tourism industry might absorb some unemployed retailers .
but shops and showrooms can not be transformed into tourist attractions , whose capacity will remain limited until enough time has passed to build new hotels , recreational facilities , etc .
but just as fiscal policy was being tightened when cyclical economic conditions seemed to call for easing , it is now being eased when conditions seem to call for tightening .
the output gap in advanced economies has all but disappeared , inflation is picking up , and world economic growth is forecast to be its strongest since 2010 .
in 2013 , japan was the only advanced economy to loosen fiscal policy .
but this year , the united kingdom appears to be the only one preparing to tighten its policy – and that is assuming recent political ruptures have n’t altered its fiscal orientation , which will be reflected in the chancellor of the exchequer ’s autumn statement .
most observers would agree that government debt levels are uncomfortably high in many advanced economies , so it would be prudent for policymakers to discuss strategies for bringing them down .
and , with demand high and housing supply fixed – at least in the short run – prices go up .
second , the 70-year period that began with the widespread diffusion of the automobile – during which one could get nearly anywhere in a typical metropolitan area in half an hour or less – is over .
before there was widespread automobile ownership , land prices depended on location , and proximity to the central city or to the local railroad station carried a premium .
now , with serious congestion slowing traffic in major cities to a crawl , the land gradient in housing prices is steep once again .
perhaps this steepening of the location gradient could be delayed for a decade if we were willing to shift to denser residential patterns .
with austerity – that is , reducing the deficit , once the recession has ended – recovery might take longer to become consolidated ; but once it is , economic performance is even more stable , because the government ’s accounts are in a sustainable position .
john maynard keynes famously said , “ in the long run , we are all dead . ”
that may be true , on a long enough timeline .
but it is no excuse to dismiss longer-term considerations .
in fact , for the eurozone , the long run seems to have arrived – and the economy is still alive and kicking .
a famous psychological experiment found that young children who could resist the immediate temptation to eat a marshmallow , and thereby gain two marshmallows in the future , were likelier to thrive as adults than those who could n’t .
likewise , societies that defer instant consumption in order to save and invest for the future will enjoy higher future incomes and greater retirement security .
( when american economists advise china to boost consumption and cut saving , they are merely peddling the bad habits of american culture , which saves and invests far too little for america ’s future . )
second , saving and investment flows are global .
a country such as china , with a high saving rate that exceeds local investment needs , can support investment in other parts of the world that save less , notably low-income africa and asia .
but these “ green energy ” bikes amount to a victory of empty gestures over substance and reason – which makes them sadly representative of cop21 itself .
the agreement reached in paris contains promises that , if enacted between now and the target date of 2030 , will cost the global economy at least $ 1 trillion dollars a year – and possibly twice as much if politicians make inefficient policy choices .
this makes the agreement the costliest in history .
my peer-reviewed research paper , published in global policy , shows that the 2016-2030 promises on cutting emissions of carbon dioxide will reduce temperatures by 2100 by just 0.05 ° celsius ( 0.09 ° fahrenheit ) .
even if the promised emissions cuts continued throughout the century , the paris agreement would cut global temperature rises by just 0.17 ° c. scientists from the massachusetts institute of technology find a similar temperature reduction .
shut out on transfers of military technology and hardware by the united states ever since the tiennamen square incident of 1989 ; feeling increasingly " encircled " by the " redefined " japan-u.s. alliance ( agreed in april 1996 ) ; china is particularly anxious to upgrade and strengthen its military might , and quickly .
intervention by two american aircraft carriers in the taiwan straits in march 1996 humiliated the chinese , who were forced to stop intimidating taiwan with missile tests .
russia , having seen its gross domestic product fall 40 % since communism ’s end , needs to retain its defense industry as one of the few sources of national revenues .
despite initial denials by the kremlin , china early this year did buy two modern destroyers along with anti-ship missiles from russia .
an added worry , both for russia and asia , is that the russian government is losing control of the unofficial , black market flow of arms to china .
left unanswered , however , is what comes next .
china bashers typically change their tune after a presidential election .
but there is nothing typical about the pressures that are likely to continue squeezing american families long after november 6 .
both obama and romney run the risk of painting themselves into a corner when it comes to china .
that could take all of us to the edge of a slippery slope .
they are people who in some ways lacked full citizenship , who demanded it , and who redefined the political order by obtaining it .
today the great task is to calm the fears that our traditions are being undermined ; to reach out to people who are coming into our lands from other countries ; and to find a way of recreating our political ethic around the kernel of human rights , equality , non-discrimination , and democracy .
if we succeed , we can create a sense that we belong together , even though our reasons for believing so may be different .
but increasing individualism – a focus on one ’s own ambitions and economic prosperity – in many countries poses a stubborn obstacle to realizing this vision .
indeed , the utter lack of a sense of solidarity among so many people – horrifyingly evident in the us health-care debate – is now undermining the very basis of what a modern democratic society is .
but halappanavar and her husband were then informed that ireland is a catholic country ; the fetus still had a heartbeat , so the procedure was out of the question .
halappanavar died from septicemia , which her family is certain would not have developed if the termination had been carried out .
protests in ireland have put prime minister enda kenny on the spot , with activists there , like those in india , arguing that halappanavar died because of a theocratic approach to health care .
irish abortion-rights activists point out that , legally , the life of the fetus does not take precedence over the life of the mother in their country , but it does take precedence over the health of the mother – a distinction that american abortion opponents have long sought to replicate in the united states .
the halappanavar case thus reverses the western stereotype of eastern societies as preserves of superstition and religious extremism .
all countries ’ legitimizing narratives blend historical fact and myth .
but , in some cases , historical legacies can gain excessive influence , overwhelming leaders ’ capacity to make rational policy choices .
that explains why park has sought closer ties with china , even though south korea ’s natural regional partner is democratic japan .
one source of hope stems from abe ’s landslide victory in the recent snap general election , which gives him the political capital to reach out to park with a grand bargain : if japan expresses remorse more clearly for its militaristic past , south korea will agree to leave historical grievances out of official policy .
japan and south korea can not change the past .
munich – as america ’s various rescue plans take hold , stock markets are recovering somewhat .
the s & p 500 price/earnings ratio is gradually climbing back to its long-term average of 16 .
bank shares in particular are rebounding , and some banks have even succeeded in repaying at least part of their government-provided capital .
but , as i point out in my new book kasino-kapitalismus , this may only be a temporary improvement in expectations rather than a sign of permanent recovery , as the size of the banks ’ hidden losses on their balance sheets is probably enormous .
according to the international monetary fund ’s most recent estimates , the total write-offs on financial claims in this crisis will be $ 4.05 trillion for the united states , japan , the euro zone and the united kingdom , of which the us alone will have to absorb $ 2.7 trillion .
conceived , perhaps , with the best intentions , the morales model is giving hope to bolivia ’s poorest ; but it will only pave the way for frustrated hopes ­ – also nothing new in bolivia .
thirty years after the national revolution of 1952 bolivia ’s per capita income remained basically the same , with poverty steady at over 50 % of the population .
a state-led developmental model in bolivia is doomed to fail , because it requires strong institutions , universal citizenship , and the rule of law .
none of them can currently be found in bolivia , which means that the money concentrated in the state will surely be redistributed by patrimonial and clientelistic means , siphoned off by corruption , and subjected to social pressures of all sorts .
whatever remains for public investments are sure to be wasted , as projects tend to pass cost-benefit analysis when the financing comes from easy money , generously provided by mother nature .
still , a majority of french citizens remain deeply concerned about the threat of terrorism not just from abroad , but from people living in france , often with french citizenship .
and similar fears about homegrown extremism can be observed in many other european countries .
in recent years , some of those drawn to islamist-inspired extremism have carried out attacks with rudimentary instruments , from cars and delivery trucks to kitchen knives .
although violent extremists are an ultra-minority in the muslim population , their actions have fueled a growing distrust in french society .
worse still , the successful military campaign against isis raises new fears about violent extremists returning from syria .
while eight of the top ten hosting countries , including several low - and middle-income countries , have shouldered considerable costs despite the strain on education systems to ensure that refugees attend school alongside nationals , most countries either exclude refugees from national education systems or assign them to separate facilities .
this entrenches disadvantage and hampers social integration .
the two landmark global compacts on migration and refugees adopted by un member states last december point the way toward addressing this challenge .
achieving the needed educational transformation will require far more financing than is currently on offer .
as it stands , the global annual funding gap for education amounts to nearly $ 40 billion .
the international monetary fund credits asian intra-regional trade as the main factor behind its recent export boom and strong economic growth .
africa , with its huge and often untapped markets , must follow the same path .
africans themselves must tackle these issues , but our international partners have an important role to play .
the debate over the failure of international aid to produce development , together with the current financial crisis , have added weight to arguments against development assistance .
but the argument should not be about whether to provide aid – no one can question the many successes that aid has brought , or its importance in providing a safety net for those who would otherwise be left to suffer .
london – when the united kingdom announced earlier this month that it had agreed to become a founding member of the china-led asian infrastructure investment bank ( aiib ) , most of the headlines focused not on the news itself , but on the friction the decision had caused between the uk and the united states .
the white house issued a statement urging the british government to “ use its voice to push for adoption of high standards . "
and one senior us administration official was quoted accusing the uk of “ constant accommodation of china , which is not the best way to engage a rising power . "
in fact , it is the us that is advocating the wrong approach .
in the uk , the diplomatic spat served as an occasion for the british press to air criticism from those who believe that the government should adopt a stronger stance on china .
indeed , it is hard to find any persuasive analysis of today ’s crisis from the left beyond anti-capitalist slogans .
the socialists blame greedy financiers , but who does not ?
in terms of remedies , the socialists do not offer anything more than the keynesian solutions that are now being proposed by the right .
since george w. bush showed the way towards bank nationalization , vast public spending , industrial bailouts , and budget deficits , the socialists have been left without wiggle room .
french president nicolas sarkozy tries to rekindle growth through the protectionist defense of “ national industries ” and huge investments in public infrastructure , so what more can socialists ask for ?
they also demand faster implementation of the necessary changes to the eurozone ’s economic governance in order to create a more stable and hospitable environment for fiscal consolidation and reform .
a prolonged recession , punctuated by high – or prohibitive – borrowing costs , makes achieving either the fiscal or the reform targets increasingly difficult , if not impossible .
the burden of adjustment can not fall exclusively on the deficit countries – unless , that is , a moral element of “ punishment ” is involved .
the core countries , led by germany , distrust the over-indebted countries ’ determination to pursue reforms if their financing conditions are eased .
moreover , they oppose key changes in the eurozone ’s economic governance .
moreover , turkey does n’t seem to care what its allies think .
for example , it recently raised eyebrows within nato yet again by purchasing new-generation russian s-400 antiaircraft batteries .
this does not bode well for any future peace process .
after all , western countries will need turkey to counterbalance the russians , whose broader strategic agenda goes well beyond the middle east .
when historians look back at the syria conflict , they will praise both former presidents barack obama and donald trump for relentlessly pursuing isis .
the uk is simply being smart when it promotes its own interests by cooperating with china .
one of the few positive consequences of the 2008 financial crisis was the elevation of the g-20 's global role ; in principle , it is a far more representative forum for international leadership than the g-7 ever was .
there is , however , a downside to the g-20 's emergence : the large number of participants can make it difficult to reach agreements and get things done .
a new g-7 needs to be created within the g-20 , thereby providing china with a degree of influence that reflects its economic weight and requires it to assume a commensurate proportion of global responsibility .
space at the table for china could be obtained if the eurozone countries , signaling their commitment to the common currency , agreed to surrender their individual seats in exchange for one representing the entire monetary union .
this leaves a range of options for choosing the next wbg president .
the us could select an american who appeals to other countries : kim , for example , touted his korean origins during his 2012 campaign for the post .
it could select a dual national or an immigrant , such as former wbg president james wolfensohn , an australian who became a us citizen .
or it could back a non-american candidate from an allied country .
what is important is that the nominee enjoys the trust of the us and most other countries , and can reconcile countries ’ diverse interests in a true spirit of multilateralism .
in terms of shadowy influence-peddling , china ’s actions have been particularly concerning .
chinese president xi jinping has explicitly encouraged his country ’s think tanks to “ advance the chinese narrative ” globally .
and in many cases , china-based think tanks have become instruments for expanding the country ’s sphere of influence .
according to a report by the european council on foreign relations , china ’s belt and road initiative , with its need for complex coordination , has created the perfect policy space for think tanks that “ tell a good china story ” to prosper .
these include networks such as silks and individual think tanks such as the charhar institute , which also recently established a “ national committee for china-us relations . ”
world oil prices crossed $ 40 a barrel in mid-summer , and have since climbed to the mid - $ 50 's .
today 's oil prices are still only two-thirds the real peak reached during the iranian revolution of 1979 , and future markets expect the oil price to fall back and settle at perhaps $ 45 a barrel .
but the current high level of oil prices has led forecasters to start reining in their expectations for economic growth .
" higher oil prices are here to stay , " says the american economic forecaster allen sinai .
" [ t ] hat has to subtract growth and could cause core inflation to pick up . "
cross-border flows of data and information will also be restricted , raising concerns about a “ splinternet ” between the us and china .
and owing to increased us scrutiny , chinese foreign direct investment in america has already collapsed by 80 % from its 2017 level .
now , new legislative proposals threaten to bar us public pension funds from investing in chinese firms , restrict chinese venture capital investments in the us , and force some chinese firms to delist from us stock exchanges altogether .
the us has also grown more suspicious of us-based chinese students and scholars who may be in a position to steal us technological know-how or engage in outright espionage .
and china , for its part , will increasingly seek to circumvent the us-controlled international financial system , and to shield itself from america ’s weaponization of the dollar .
us debt hardly looks like a bargain right now , even without the sinking dollar .
far-flung military misadventures continue to stretch the country ’s fiscal resources , with costs potentially running into many trillions of dollars , according a recent study by linda bilmes and joseph stiglitz .
next year will almost certainly see a massive rise in us corporate defaults , even though many firms entered the recession with relatively strong balance sheets .
state and municipal finances are in even worse shape .
with tax revenues collapsing due to falling home prices and incomes , dozens of us municipalities could well go into receivership , as new york city did in the 1970 ’s .
collectively , their $ 55 billion in earnings outstripped the entire national income of more than 100 countries .
to put these astronomical numbers in perspective , i had gabriel try to confirm that to be among the top nine earners in the united states , you had to pull in at least $ 150 per second , including time spent eating and sleeping .
that is $ 9,000 per minute , or $ 540,000 per hour .
how much do america ’s highest income earners make compared to the world ’s billion poorest individuals ?
well , if the top nine donated their earnings , it would be the equivalent of about three months income for the bottom billion .
american power is , instead , seen as resting on the “ pillar of inspiration ” rather than the “ pillar of action . ”
for example , secretary of state john quincy adams famously proclaimed on independence day in 1821 that the united states “ does goes not abroad , in search of monsters to destroy .
she is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all .
she is the champion and vindicator only of her own . ”
but the soft power of inspiration is not the only ethical tradition in american foreign policy .
the court ruled against the right of the united states-based animal rights group people for the ethical treatment of animals to exhibit posters that juxtapose photographs of victims of the holocaust with photographs of animals in factory farms and at slaughterhouses .
the posters bear the heading : “ to animals , all people are nazis ” – a line from the polish-born jewish writer isaac bashevis singer .
according to the court , germany ’s laws on freedom of speech did not protect peta ’s campaign , because to make “ the fate of the victims of the holocaust appear banal and trivial ” was an offense against human dignity .
peta was , of course , not arguing that holocaust victims ’ fate was banal or trivial .
on the contrary , it was using the holocaust – which we would all agree was utterly horrific – to suggest , as isaac bashevis singer did , that there are parallels between the way the nazis treated jews and the way we treat animals .
rather , they fight to protect their own interests and livelihoods , whether that be operating a dairy farm or running a government .
as we continually attempt to apply new technologies to improve human and environmental wellbeing , this distinction is vital .
avoiding barriers to technological progress requires understanding and addressing its downsides .
for example , as machines become increasingly capable , robots are replacing a growing number of workers .
it will not be long before those robots will be able not only to perform more complex tasks , but also to learn faster than workers can be trained .
today , portugal is ahead by almost € 20 billion ( $ 27.5 billion ) .
this represents a potential loss of more than 10 % of output for greece .
lack of export growth thus has made the recession in greece much longer and deeper than it would have been otherwise .
if greek exports had increased at the same rate as those of portugal ( or spain ) , the recession would have ended by now .
moreover , the lack of export growth made the fiscal adjustment much more difficult .
given that 80 % of mexico ’s total exports go to the us , the effects on mexico would have been economically crippling and politically destabilizing , leaving the country even less equipped to do anything about illegal immigration .
unlike the usmca , which was at least premised on the goal of addressing trade issues , trump ’s tariff pronunciamento was a bald-faced attempt to force the mexican government to solve america ’s own immigration problem .
in other words , a trade weapon was being deployed neither to address a trade issue nor as part of a legitimate sanctions regime , such as that imposed on russia following its illegal annexation of crimea in 2014 .
on the rare occasions when trade sanctions have been used for non-trade reasons , they were a measure of last resort , as in the case of apartheid south africa , where they succeeded because they had multilateral support .
once trade measures are used indiscriminately to advance non-trade objectives , the damage to the entire trading system is done – and it can be enormous .
new delhi – according to the united nations ’ population division , the world ’s human population hit seven billion on october 31 .
as always happens whenever we approach such a milestone , this one has produced a spike in conferences , seminars , and learned articles , including the usual dire malthusian predictions .
after all , the un forecasts that world population will rise to 9.3 billion in 2050 and surpass 10 billion by the end of this century .
such forecasts , however , misrepresent underlying demographic dynamics .
the future we face is not one of too much population growth , but too little .
in exchange , the kremlin has pledged to support – but only after the constitution is changed – ukraine ’s national government in its reassertion of control over those regions , as well as over its border with russia .
in theory , the negotiations are being held between the government in kyiv and the leaders of the separatist regions .
the european union is applying pressure on all sides , including russia , where it is holding out the possibility that economic sanctions will be lifted as an eventual reward for the kremlin ’s support in the peace effort .
russia has offered to use what it calls its “ limited influence ” to persuade the rebel governments to cooperate .
if , however , russia is actually in full control of the separatist regions and is actively integrating them into its economy , as the document obtained by bild suggests , the kremlin can no longer be considered an outside party , attempting to influence an uncooperative ally .
nothing reveals the decline of the united states in the region better than the contrast between america ’s sober use of power in the first gulf war in 1991 and the hubris and deceit of today ’s iraq war .
in 1991 , america forged the most formidable international coalition since world war ii , and led it in a fully legitimate war aimed at restoring regional balance after saddam hussein ’s invasion of kuwait .
in 2003 , america went to war without its trans-atlantic allies after manipulating false assertions .
in doing so , the us embarked on a preposterous grand strategy that aimed no less at simultaneously dismantling iraq ’s tyrannical regime , restructuring the entire middle east , destroying al-qaeda , and helping democracy to take root throughout the arab world .
the result has been utter failure : military defeat and a severe degradation of america ’s moral standing .
one of the strangest claims made in the debates about social insurance now roiling the world ’s richest countries is the that government-funded defined-benefit pension programs ( such as america ’s social security system ) are outmoded .
these programs were fine , the argument goes , for the industrial economy of the great depression and the post-world war ii generation , but they have become obsolete in today ’s high-tech , networked , post-industrial economy .
advocates of this argument propose a different model .
just as corporations today are much happier supporting workers ’ pensions by contributing to employees ’ private accounts , so governments today should offer ( or require ) contributions to privately owned accounts .
the value of these accounts would fluctuate with the market rather than resting on a defined-benefit scheme that guarantees a fixed real sum of resources available upon retirement .
does anyone in their right mind think that any country would willingly put itself through what greece has gone through , just to get a free ride from its creditors ?
if there is a moral hazard , it is on the part of the lenders – especially in the private sector – who have been bailed out repeatedly .
if europe has allowed these debts to move from the private sector to the public sector – a well-established pattern over the past half-century – it is europe , not greece , that should bear the consequences .
indeed , greece ’s current plight , including the massive run-up in the debt ratio , is largely the fault of the misguided troika programs foisted on it .
so it is not debt restructuring , but its absence , that is “ immoral . ”
neither scenario makes much sense today .
europe and china are not particularly interested in depressing world prices of their imports or in the resulting revenue .
employment considerations are not a major issue , either .
while some countries in the eurozone suffer from high levels of unemployment , there is nothing that protectionism can do for these countries that expansionary fiscal or monetary policy ( the latter by the european central bank ) can not do better .
if europe , china , and other trade partners were to retaliate in response to trump ’s tariffs they would simply reduce their own gains from trade without reaping any of the advantages of protectionism .
saving obama ’s honor hardly seems worth that risk .
this is the view of many people in syria , even among the rebels .
it is the view of most people in europe .
it is also the view of most people in the us .
perhaps it is even the view of obama himself , which is why he is playing for time , desperately turning over approval of an attack on syria to the us congress .
but we tend to retain into adulthood the same views of god that we formed in childhood .
an old man with a long beard watches over us , and most of us retain a pretty literal opinion of the stories about his son told in the bible ’s new testament .
it is this god that atheists like dawkins and hitchens attack .
and , with such a target , it is not very difficult to poke holes and pile on the ridicule .
leave aside the fact that you can make an even stronger case against godlessness – remember the atrocities of atheist totalitarians in the twentieth century – and consider the assault on those whose commitment to literal interpretations of religious texts means that they deny science and reason .
their preferred model calls for the un to provide the funding and most other support for the mission , while allowing the au to maintain its leadership role .
many western governments , however , refuse to place their forces under au command , owing to its perceived weaknesses , and have conditioned further support for peacekeeping operations in darfur on the un ’s assuming control .
but the un has found it difficult to attract sufficient volunteers for such a force , since foreign governments have acceded to sudanese demands that the hybrid force remain predominantly african .
at the same time , the complex chain of command envisaged for an au-un force recalls some of the worst features of nato-un operations in the former yugoslavia during the 1990 ’s .
au commanders on the ground would retain tactical control , a joint au-un command would exercise operational supervision , and the un would establish the force ’s overall strategic objectives .
new york – there was a remarkable similarity between european central bank president mario draghi ’s statement after a recent meeting of the ecb governing council and us federal reserve chair janet yellen ’s first testimony to congress : both asserted that their policy decisions would take into account only domestic conditions .
in other words , emerging-market countries , though subject to significant spillover effects from advanced economies ’ monetary policies , are on their own .
this confirms what emerging-country authorities have known for a while .
in 2010 – following the fed ’s announcement of a third round of quantitative easing – brazilian finance minister guido mantega accused advanced countries of waging a global “ currency war . ”
after all , advanced economies ’ policies were driving large and volatile capital flows into the major emerging markets , pushing up their exchange rates and damaging their export competitiveness – a phenomenon that brazilian president dilma rousseff later referred to as a “ capital tsunami . ”
riyadh – saudi arabia has drawn a lot of criticism lately for its leading role in the war against houthi rebels in yemen .
some deride the kingdom , the richest arab state , for taking action against the poorest .
others have claimed that the fight against the houthis – a zaidi shia-led religious-political movement – is just one element in a broader war on the shia that saudi arabia has supposedly been waging .
these are simplistic claims , reflecting a fundamental misunderstanding about the kingdom ’s role in yemen – and , indeed , in the entire arab world .
saudi arabia is not out to get the zaidis .
china has shown itself adept at assertively promoting its national interests and playing classical balance-of-power geopolitics .
but , in order to displace the us and assume the mantle of leadership in asia , china must do more than pursue its own interests or contain potential rivals .
most fundamentally , what does china represent in terms of values and ideas ?
in the absence of an answer to that question , china ’s overly assertive policies have proven a diplomatic boon for the us in strengthening and expanding american security arrangements in asia .
south korea has tightened its military alliance with the us , japan has backed away from a move to get the us to move its marine airbase out of okinawa , and india , vietnam , indonesia , and the philippines , among others , have drawn closer to the us .
instead of borrowing to pay for the expensive “ school sets ” students are required to purchase , poles used their 500 + benefits instead .
and while women ’s employment rates decreased as women left minimum-wage jobs , salaries , particularly for store clerks , rose sharply .
given the dramatic success of the program , other countries are following suit .
lithuania introduced a less generous version of family 500 + in 2018 .
those who care about democracy in poland , hungary , and elsewhere in europe and beyond should acknowledge that many voters are buying into the nationalist right ’s vision of a social state that advances national priorities , cares for the poor , and supports families .
different people read it to mean different things .
that can make a resolution easier to adopt , but more difficult to act on .
it thus comes as little surprise that there is still no peace between israelis and palestinians , despite countless diplomatic undertakings by the united states , the european union and its members , the un , and the parties themselves .
to be fair , resolution 242 can not be blamed for this state of affairs .
peace comes only when a conflict becomes ripe for resolution , which happens when the leaders of the principal protagonists are both willing and able to embrace compromise .
the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan oil pipeline -- which will bypass russia when it is completed -- can not re-define the country 's economic strategy to the extent that shevardnadze had sought .
instead , georgia 's long-term economic success will depend on exports to the russian market : neither georgian wine nor georgian fruit is needed in the united states or italy .
shevardnadze 's emphasis on the btc pipeline also clearly reflects georgia 's pro-western strategic orientation .
that , too , is unlikely to change under saakashvili .
on the other hand , this should become less of a burden on bilateral relations as russia itself moves closer to nato , the us , and the european union .
but the lesson of the libyan intervention is that division can be overcome if the will exists .
europe is not a monolith , but in many areas it can still act coherently , even without complete agreement .
whether the outlier is germany or another eu member state , division need not be fatal .
of course , none of this means that the international intervention in libya will succeed ; the situation in libya is far too complicated to predict the outcome .
what it does mean , however , is that europe is finding a way to work when it comes to foreign policy .
similarly , life expectancy at birth in ssa countries lagged 16 years behind the developing-country average , 14 years behind countries in south asia , and 21 years behind countries in east asia , latin america , and the caribbean .
in combined gross enrolment in primary , secondary and higher education , ssa countries stood 19 % below the average for developing countries , 11 % below south asian countries , 29 % below east asia and the pacific , and 32 % below latin america and the caribbean .
what accounts for this broad-based underdevelopment ?
until the late 1800 ’s , most of africa was unexplored and occupied by hunter-gatherers and practitioners of subsistence agriculture .
land was relatively abundant and allocated by tribal chiefs without regard to western-style property rights .
geneva – the recent sharp spike in food prices and growing concerns about food security have sparked anxiety worldwide .
the possibility of being unable to put food on the table fills parents with a deep sense of foreboding .
and , because the world ’s poorest people spend a higher proportion of their income on food , they are the worst affected , raising the risk that years of progress in reducing poverty could be reversed .
the seemingly unalterable factors generating these record-setting rises in food prices – a shift to higher protein diets in many countries , growing populations , greater use of biofuels , and climate change – suggest that elevated food prices are here to stay .
in the absence of solutions that alleviate growing pressure on supplies , hunger and malnutrition will increase .
and this is what the anti-corruption agenda often ends up stimulating : the creation of organizations that are more obsessed with abiding by the new and burdensome processes than they are with achieving their stated goals .
as harvard ’s lant pritchett , michael woolcock , and andrews argue , when inept organizations adopt “ best practices ” such as financial management systems and procurement rules , they become too distracted by decision-distorting protocols to do what they were established to do .
as francis fukuyama has pointed out , the development of a capable state that is accountable and ruled by law is one of the crowning achievements of human civilization .
it involves the creation of a shared sense of “ us , ” an imagined community on whose behalf the state acts .
this is not an easy task when societies are deeply divided by ethnicity , religion , or social status .
by 2014 , he had taken over the presidential palace and surrounded himself by a guard meant to evoke ottoman splendor , a fairly transparent effort to compensate for his inability to shape regional developments according to his – much less his country ’s – interests .
this approach mirrors that of russian president vladimir putin , who uses the sumptuous trappings and immense resources of his office to claim credit for restoring his country ’s national pride , particularly when he is trying to persuade ordinary russians to make economic sacrifices .
likewise , erdoğan has positioned himself as a kind of protector of turks ’ dignity and sense of themselves as constituting a great power .
with the syrian conflict raging next door , however , erdoğan ’s claims are far from convincing .
turkey is facing a refugee crisis that dwarfs the one confronting europe ; a proliferation of terrorist attacks on its territory ; and heightened tensions with the kremlin , following its downing of a russian warplane near its border with syria in november .
president clinton ’s trip to africa highlighted to americans -- usually most neglectful of africa except when in deep crisis -- the dramatic changes underway on the continent .
and at this year ’s world economic forum summit in southern africa , nearly 900 leading businessmen from the u.s. , europe , asia , and africa , met with the new political leadership to map a way forward .
of course intentions and results are two different matters .
africa has a long road ahead .
it is on most measures , several decades , if not a century or more , behind the advanced economies in economic organization and level of income .
in the last hundred years , contests of nationalism ( with god on both sides ) nearly annihilated europe , and the cold war could have done so .
the moment you believe " better dead than red " you are in trouble .
dying to save your home , family , or country may be rational .
but martyrdom is different and dangerous .
as the romanian philosopher e. m. cioran says : " once man loses his faculty of indifference he becomes a potential murderer ; once he transforms his idea into a god the consequences are incalculable . "
that , in a nutshell , was the soviet model , which failed once and would fail again .
if putin is serious about diversifying and strengthening russia ’s commodities-based economy , thereby improving the lives of his country ’s people , he must attract advanced technologies and foreign investment , especially from the west .
for that , he must pursue democratic reforms , institutional regeneration , and renewed diplomatic ties with the west .
russia is in no position to create an alternative international system ; but , if putin continues to pursue an outdated and antagonistic foreign policy , it can undermine the existing one .
at a time when the world is facing so many destabilizing challenges , this would not be good for anyone .
cambridge -- will the political resurgence of labor unions throw a wrench into the wheels of globalization ?
or will their growing strength serve to make globalization more sustainable by fostering great equality and fairness ?
one way or the other , unions stand as a major wild card for the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond .
unions ’ rising influence is evident in many recent events : german chancellor angela merkel ’s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for postal employees ; several american presidential candidates ’ open misgivings about trade and immigration ; and the chinese leadership ’s nascent concerns about labor standards .
along with their political clout , unions ’ intellectual respectability is also experiencing a renaissance .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
yet ambitious plans to boost its hydro-generating capacity significantly by damming international rivers have embroiled the country in water disputes with most neighbors , even north korea .
more broadly , china ’s dam-building passion has spawned two key developments .
first , chinese companies now dominate the global hydropower-equipment export market .
sinohydro alone , having eclipsed western equipment suppliers like abb , alstom , general electric , and siemens , claims to control half the market .
second , the state-run hydropower industry ’s growing clout within china has led the government to campaign aggressively for overseas dam projects by offering low-interest loans to other governments .
new york – there are many recurring debates in american foreign policy – for example , isolationism versus internationalism , and unilateralism versus multilateralism .
but no debate is more persistent than that between those who believe that american foreign policy ’s principal purpose should be to influence the external behavior of other states and those who hold that it should be to shape their internal nature .
this debate between “ realists ” and “ idealists ” is intense and long-standing .
during the cold war , there were those who argued that the united states should try to “ roll back ” the soviet union , bring down the communist system , and replace it with democratic capitalism .
others deemed this to be too dangerous in an era defined by nuclear weapons , and the us opted instead for a policy of containment , working to limit the reach of soviet power and influence .
if britain ’s transitional payments continued near the current level of € 10 billion for the five or six years realistically required to negotiate a permanent trading relationship , they would add up to the same amount .
second , a british budget offer would be a powerful tool to create the “ deep and special partnership ” with europe that may claims is her ultimate goal .
until last month , may avoided defining this phrase , for fear of antagonizing her party ’s hardline europhobes .
but in her florence speech , may promised british businesses something close to the current level of access to eu markets .
she also recognized that any privileged access to eu markets would require budget contributions , as in the case of norway and switzerland .
even if may can strike an exit deal , it is impossible to negotiate and ratify a sector-by-sector trade agreement in under two years .
the eu-canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement , for example , took seven years to hash out – and was almost scotched by the parliament of belgium ’s wallonia region .
there can be no “ phased implementation ” of a trade deal that has not been finalized , so uk-based car companies , financial institutions , and other businesses that export to the eu now should start preparing for the “ cliff edge ” that may wants to avoid .
may has no electoral mandate to pursue a hard brexit .
many of the 52 % of britons who voted for leave want to stay in the single market , as do all of those who voted for remain .
this is enormously important and healthy .
for the first time , there is lively and intelligent debate around this issue , which is at the core of the middle east ’s problems .
open societies are incompatible with closed economies .
a functioning private sector that creates adequate jobs , and schools that educate the large young population for today ’s inter-connected world , are prerequisites of progress .
the israeli-palestinian issue is crucial for all the obvious reasons .
the electorate seemed tired of the persistent confrontation between băsescu and ponta , and , more generally , of the noisy , ugly , and treacherous burlesque that their country ’s political scene has become .
in his many successful years as mayor of sibiu , iohannis distinguished himself from the charismatic and shrewd politicians to whom romanians are accustomed , proving to be a sober , laconic , and pragmatic administrator .
this demeanor is part of what made it so difficult to predict his victory over the more talkative ponta .
but iohannis is different not only in his political approach ; he is an evangelical lutheran in a largely orthodox country .
the vigorous religious attacks mounted against him during the campaign highlighted that fact ’s salience for the establishment – though the orthodox leaders who backed ponta have rapidly adjusted their rhetoric to promote tolerance and cooperation .
some of these can be learned or cultivated , and courses that teach positive mental habits – like appreciating things that matter or avoiding dwelling on setbacks – have demonstrated measurable improvements in wellbeing .
the dalai lama recently helped launch a series of such courses in london , developed by action for happiness , an organization that i helped found .
whole societies can also try to improve their happiness .
british prime minister david cameron introduced the measurement of happiness into national statistics , and more recently german chancellor angela merkel launched a program to promote citizen ’s wellbeing .
how countries are governed has a huge impact on happiness .
israel is but a small part of this overall pattern .
more recently , there was america ’s event-driven shift toward cooperation with russia on ending syria ’s civil war , following a chemical-weapons attack that left at least 1,400 people dead .
all of this raises a fundamental question : does the us even need an overarching design for its foreign policy ?
if the outcome is to make its foreign policy less reliable and predictable – or , worse , susceptible to misunderstanding – then it certainly does not .
the new world order has given way to an order-less world , in which reliability and predictability have given way to rapid shifts in focus and fickle commitments .
the financial services act of 1986 put an end to the pure self-regulation regime .
financial interests opposed it vigorously at the time , viewing it as the thin end of a dangerous wedge , though they could not have guessed just how thick that wedge would eventually become .
it is also difficult to trace back to the 1980 ’s the origins of the credit explosion and the proliferation of exotic and poorly understood financial instruments that lay at the heart of the 2007-2008 crisis .
the most dangerous trends , including the upsurge of global imbalances and the dramatic financialization of the economy , accelerated dangerously from about 2004 onwards .
thatcher herself was not an enthusiast for credit , once famously saying , “ i do n’t believe in credit cards . ”
a unilateral military strike would carry potentially dire consequences .
alas , given us president barack obama ’s lamentable handling of the crisis in syria , israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu may conclude that he has no option but to go it alone .
indeed , iranian hardliners may welcome an israeli strike , and even seek to provoke it , as a means of rallying the iranian population behind them .
there is a better way to prevent the proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the region : a “ wmd-free zone , ” built on a system of incentives that include economic and technical support for countries that join , as well as security guarantees from the united nations security council ’s permanent members .
the zone should also enforce economic and political sanctions on states that choose to remain outside , and – again , supported by the security council ’s permanent members – impose military sanctions on those that try to develop wmds .
cambridge – more than 130,000 people are said to have died in syria ’s civil war .
united nations reports of atrocities , internet images of attacks on civilians , and accounts of suffering refugees rend our hearts .
but what is to be done – and by whom ?
recently , the canadian scholar-politician michael ignatieff urged us president barack obama to impose a no-fly zone over syria , despite the near-certainty that russia would veto the united nations security council resolution needed to legalize such a move .
in ignatieff ’s view , if syrian president bashar al-assad is allowed to prevail , his forces will obliterate the remaining sunni insurgents – at least for now ; with hatreds inflamed , blood eventually will flow again .
now that a raucous regional situation is being joined to a raucous american election season ( where no issue is excluded from the political arena ) , the task of assembling these components will be even more difficult .
it is too early to assess the historical effect of the arab spring , but if there is one conclusion that can be drawn today , it is that israel and its palestinian neighbors had little to do with it .
for americans ( and others ) who believe that the arab world thinks about nothing but the palestinian cause , events this spring in north africa , the arabian peninsula , and even the levant should have convinced them otherwise .
in the months ahead , we can expect the region ’s countries to remain focused on issues of governance and capacity building , human rights , and how to create economies that respond to their restive citizens ’ demands for a better life .
new arab leaders will struggle mightily with the public ’s rising expectations , and their willingness to get behind a peace process will take a backseat to that struggle .
london – vulnerable communities face the brunt of climate change – from rising sea levels and extreme weather events to prolonged severe droughts and flooding .
according to the world bank , without effective mitigation measures , climate change could push more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030 .
to help the most vulnerable communities become more resilient to the effects of climate change , financial institutions should support small and medium-size enterprises .
in emerging economies , smes account for as much as 45 % of employment and up to 33 % of gdp – and these numbers are significantly higher when informal smes are included .
when an sme builds up its own climate resilience , it can have cascading effects in the community around it .
cutting methane is actually cheaper than cutting carbon .
and because methane is a much shorter-lived gas than co2 , we can prevent some of the worst of short-term warming through its mitigation .
agricultural production accounts for half of anthropogenic methane , but wastewater systems , landfills , and coal mining also create the gas .
professor claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research ( diw ) argues that spending $ 14 billion to $ 30 billion to reduce methane would create benefits – from the reduction in warming – between 1.4 and three times higher .
we could also put a bigger focus on reducing black carbon , considered responsible for as much as 40 % of current net warming and one-third of arctic melting .
it has never had to deal with others as equals , unlike traditional european powers , which have done so for centuries .
china ’s challenge , however , may be more difficult .
it not only has to live with the reality of us power ; it must also take into account the american ideal .
in 1989 , large numbers of chinese students took over tiananmen square to demand more rights , adopting a symbol resembling the statue of liberty .
today , too , it is not america ’s military strength that threatens or challenges china , but rather the enduring attraction of “ the american dream . ”
but , collectively , eu member states – even without the united kingdom – would constitute a power of similar magnitude .
by bolstering its strategic sovereignty , therefore , europe could make such a g3 world a reality .
a stronger and more unified europe , the argument goes , could then compete with the us and china in most domains – including by “ weaponizing ” its economic resources to further its geostrategic objectives .
yet european leaders tempted by the prospect of a g3 world must address two related concerns .
first , it is unclear how the eu will achieve the necessary level of integration when most important decisions in the bloc still require unanimity among member states .
after all , this is how the administration has been dealing with canada and mexico .
trump has temporarily exempted those two countries from the tariffs , but now expects concessions from them in his administration ’s renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement .
while the us has , on average , less tariff protection than europe , the difference is minor ( europe 's unweighted customs duty averages 5.2 % , versus 3.5 % for the us ) .
both countries maintain relatively open economies with stronger protections in specific sectors .
regulatory divergences are a much more important obstacle to us-european trade than tariffs .
do n’t i somehow still “ own ” it ?
do n’t i have rights of control over my own body ?
how can a commercial firm not only deny me the right to know my own genetic profile unless i pay their fee for the diagnostic test , which might be fair enough , but also to prevent any other firm from offering me a similar test unless those firms pay it a license fee ?
proprietary rights for commercial firms over the most basic element of an individual ’s genetic identity should not be enforceable .
we do not have to believe in genetic determinism to find that argument compelling .
for that reason , the international secretariat of the global alliance against traffic in women applauded amnesty international for supporting decriminalization .
there was also opposition from some feminist organizations , which accused amnesty of protecting “ the rights of pimps and johns . ”
instead , they argued , we should “ end the demand for paid sex ” – but without explaining how this is to be done .
in species that reproduce sexually , sex is , for obvious reasons , one of the strongest and most pervasive desires .
humans are no exception in this respect .
propelled by demand and outsourcing from advanced economies , emerging markets won a growing share of the soaring trade in goods ; by 2014 , they accounted for more than half of global trade flows .
since the great recession , however , growth in global merchandise trade has stalled , mainly owing to anemic demand in the world ’s major economies and plummeting commodity prices .
but deeper structural changes are also playing a role .
many companies are simplifying and shortening their supply chains .
for a range of goods , automation means that production location and outsourcing decisions no longer depend primarily on labor costs .
nonetheless , there is strong bipartisan support in the us for maintaining military bases in afghanistan , as a means of projecting hard power , and the increasingly charged confrontation between the us and russia over ukraine has boosted that support considerably .
in fact , former secretary of state condoleezza rice explicitly linked russia ’s actions in ukraine with “ talk of withdrawal from afghanistan , whether the security situation warrants it or not . ”
according to rice , anything less than a residual force of 10,000 american troops will send the message that the us is not serious about helping to stabilize afghanistan – a message that would embolden russian president vladimir putin further .
what she does not seem to recognize is that america ’s deteriorating ties with russia – a key conduit for us military supplies to afghanistan – could undercut its basing strategy .
the us is clearly convinced that a continued military presence in afghanistan is in its interests .
in a sign of what is to come , poland ’s foreign minister , witold waszczykowski , told the tabloid superekspres after the summit that the eu was pursuing “ a policy of double standards and deceptions . ”
according to waszczykowski , poland not only “ must drastically reduce [ its ] level of trust in the eu , ” but “ must also begin to pursue a negative policy , ” by “ blocking other initiatives or playing a very aggressive game . ”
in fact , polish prime minister beata szydło had already launched that strategy , by refusing to sign off on the summit ’s official record , as if this would render the outcome inconsequential to poland .
such infantile ploys have become all too characteristic of the pis government , which has also refused to publish polish constitutional tribunal decisions , as if this makes them legally non-binding .
the government has undoubtedly paralyzed the court , thereby undermining the rule of law in poland .
this will require massive investments in new technologies and resources , not a “ fight to the finish ” over middle east oil .
important energy technologies will include conversion of coal to liquids ( such as gasoline ) , use of tar sands and oil shale , and growth in non-fossil-fuel energy sources .
indeed , there is excellent potential for low-cost solar power , zero-emitting coal-based technologies , and safe and reliable nuclear power .
solar radiation equals roughly 10,000 times our current energy use .
we tap that solar power in many fundamental ways – food production , wind power , hydroelectric power , solar heating , solar-thermal electricity , solar panels – but the possibilities for greatly increased use of inexpensive , widely available , and environmentally friendly solar power are huge .
in the 1950 ’s , asia conjured up images of poverty and starvation .
there was a brief political infatuation among some westerners in the 1960 ’s with nehru jackets and maoist revolution , but it was brief .
as john lennon sang in 1968 , “ if you go carrying pictures of chairman mao , you ai n’t gon na make it with anyone anyhow . ”
asia ’s resurgence began with japan ’s economic success .
by the end of the century , japan ’s remarkable performance not only made the japanese wealthy , but also enhanced the country ’s soft power .
but , with austerity under fire and eu countries looking to encourage spending , the council should also consider the budget ’s shape , ensuring that the mff does not impede future growth and investment .
for example , the proposed budget slashes funding for cross-border infrastructure projects , including the expansion of high-speed broadband networks into rural areas and the development of transport and energy infrastructure .
but the eu can add considerable value by coordinating transnational infrastructure projects , thereby achieving economies of scale and avoiding a duplication of national spending .
europeans would benefit directly through improved internet access , lower energy costs , and more efficient transport links .
likewise , in order to lay the foundations for future economic growth , the eu should nurture new , sustainable industries and innovative small and medium-size enterprises – not cut funding for important research programs like horizon 2020 .
in the wake of the sichuan earthquake , criticism of china will be even more muted .
in 1997 , denmark , a nation whose people are demonstrably committed to human rights , asked the united nations human rights commission in geneva to look into the ccp ’s long track record of abuse .
china responded by canceling a danish trade mission .
france got the message , and the french soon stopped promoting human rights resolutions directed at china .
the french were then rewarded with a string of lucrative contracts in china .
the global agenda in this area determines the norms and standards that shape how public and private actors promote health , prevent disease , and administer care .
it encompasses research initiatives and global public goods such as vaccines and emergency-preparedness programs for epidemic outbreaks .
and it brings people together to work toward providing universal health coverage and ensuring everyone ’s right to health .
in the sdg framework , the separate issues of gender and health are intertwined , because gender itself is a major driver of health outcomes .
gender can influence whether one smokes tobacco , exercises regularly , or has access to nutritious food .
still , just the presence of a plurality of women has an impact .
for example , studies of us courts with multiple judges show that male judges are more willing to hear bias cases when one woman is on the bench , and significantly more willing when a second woman is added .
“ each of us , ” noted sandra day o’connor , the first female member of the us supreme court , who was renowned for not wanting to be perceived as a “ female ” justice , “ brings to our job , whatever it is , our lifetime of experience and our values . ”
in other words , women bring a fresh perspective , heard clearly only when a critical mass of them is present in any institution .
consider a woman ’s perspective on conflict .
but choosing an action for the greater good does not absolve us from moral culpability .
our hands do become dirty when we help a terrorist or a dictator .
the philosopher michael walzer puts it well : “ it is easy to get one ’s hands dirty in politics . ”
he immediately adds , however , that this getting one ’s hands dirty in this way is “ often the right thing to do . ”
in the end , an adviser to authoritarian leaders can not escape the dilemma .
but in 1991 , 800,000 yemenis were expelled because they were seen as a domestic security threat in the run-up to the first gulf war .
since then , yemeni labor has been banned from saudi arabia .
embittered and unemployed , young yemeni men often become subject to another saudi policy gone awry – its propagation for export of the sunni wahhabi form of islam .
with new wahhabi madrasas popping up everywhere in yemen because of saudi financial support , it is small wonder that the number of yemeni jihadis has grown exponentially .
but yemen , too , is engaged in its own destructive policies .
independently , honjo and colleagues identified another protein that performed a similar function .
these fundamental studies have now led to the development of new and powerful immunotherapies that are effective against cancer .
but we still have much to learn .
for some patients with some cancers , immunotherapy has been revolutionary , enabling people who had been on the verge of death to live healthy lives with no detectable traces of the disease .
yet the immunotherapy revolution is still in its infancy .
but it has followed this approach on a macro level and for problems elsewhere in the economy , without examining itself .
silicon valley ’s citizens must start applying their skill at innovation – and their pride in “ breaking things ” – to themselves .
the only way to evolve is by adapting to new environmental pressures , and now silicon valley – owing in large part to its own behavior – is facing plenty of them .
unless it changes , it will be overtaken .
the good news is that if any place has proved that it can innovate , it is silicon valley .
establishing a structured , well-functioning goat market helps to create a positive feedback loop .
if farmers are confident their goats will not be stolen , and can sell them at a decent price , they are better able to invest in improving their production system .
here , too , the innovation platform is helping .
for starters , we have trained farmers how to improve their soil by expanding legume crops , the residues of which can be used as goat fodder .
recognizing the benefits of these practices , farmers immediately began increasing crop density , applying manure , and rotating crops , thereby increasing yields and producing more feed for healthier goats .
in the early nineteenth century , wages stagnated for almost 50 years before picking up again .
that may have been an extreme situation .
but for lower-skilled workers , the transition underway today could prove just as wrenching .
with fears of increased inequality already growing , governments will need to rethink policies for providing income and job-transition support to displaced workers .
looking ahead , policymakers and businesses should keep five imperatives in mind .
this is largely a matter of mindset , not means .
fortunately , mindsets are beginning to shift .
at the 2016 au summit in kigali , african leaders recognized that , despite the au ’s achievements , it remained under-resourced and inefficient , operating below potential and failing to implement many decisions .
to reinvigorate the au , they tasked rwandan president paul kagame with leading a process in which all of them have been deeply involved .
less than three years later , a set of reform recommendations produced by kagame and the pan-african committee of experts that he appointed – through an inclusive consultative process , involving african leaders and other stakeholders – are being implemented .
both countries have floating exchange rates , meaning their central banks are not supposed to intervene in the currency market by buying and selling reserves .
more fundamentally , why do we think of reserves differently than we think about other assets on national balance sheets ?
suppose ilan goldfajn , brazil ’s star central banker , issues a bond in new york and uses the dollar proceeds to enlarge the country ’s international reserves .
at best , market participants will applaud the decision ; at worst , they will be indifferent , because brazil ’s net debt position will not have changed .
now suppose one of argentina ’s private agricultural exporters also issues an international bond and uses the dollars to enlarge one of its modern , highly competitive dairy plants , in order to sell more powdered milk to asia .
in india , for example , prime minister narendra modi is implementing a strategy that is transforming india into a technology powerhouse and setting the stage for a digital future .
in france , the government has invested in an extensive national digital plan that is expected to create 1.1 million jobs over the next 3-5 years and contribute $ 101 billion to gdp over the next decade .
while other countries are embracing robust digital strategies , the us is falling behind .
despite having led the internet race in the 1990s , the us is now the only major developed economy without a clear digitization plan .
the consequences are already starting to show : according to the 2016 bloomberg innovation index , the us is now the world ’s eighth most innovative country , having fallen two spots since 2015 .
fortunately , some countries are introducing innovative measures to address this problem .
in georgia , for example , political parties that include at least 30 % of each gender on their electoral lists receive a 30 % supplement from the state budget .
similarly , in ireland , political parties lose 50 % of their state funding if their candidate pool includes less than 30 % of either gender .
beyond financing constraints , women face high social and cultural barriers to political participation .
in particular , greater care obligations , reinforced by public perceptions of a “ woman ’s role , ” severely undermine women ’s ability to run for public office .
by all accounts , iran is a society deeply divided between those who want their country to be a respected member of the international community and those for whom iran ’s international status is better served through a nuclear-weapons program .
the international sanctions that have been imposed on iran would appear to aid the latter , rather than the former .
that might well be true if iran were a full-fledged democracy , genuinely accountable to the will of the people .
but there is scant evidence to suggest that sanctions have done anything to slow iran ’s nuclear program .
moreover , as is often the case , sanctions may have done more to decimate the middle class and further weaken the least powerful than to motivate iran ’s leaders to seek a deal .
one hopes that the paris agreement changes that .
as with the information technology revolution , advances in clean energy will require the involvement of both the public and the private sector .
because we do not yet know which innovations will be the most important in decarbonizing the economy , investment must be allocated to a wide array of choices .
long-term , patient finance must also be available to help companies minimize uncertainty and bridge the so-called “ valley of death ” between basic research and commercialization .
the bec ’s argument – that the “ new model will be a public-private partnership between governments , research institutions , and investors ” – shines a welcome spotlight on the relationship .
but those challenges will not be addressed , and opportunities will not be realized , unless children everywhere have the skills they need .
for these reasons , my country , senegal , has long been committed to giving its children – especially girls and those from disadvantaged backgrounds – a quality education .
in 2017 , we invested 25 % of our domestic budget – representing close to 7 % of gdp – in educating our children and young people .
furthermore , we plan to provide up to 90 % of the funding for a new program to improve the quality of senegal ’s education system between now and 2030 .
even so , senegal struggles to meet all the costs of strengthening its education system .
the objective must be to boost european security integration ( in its broadest sense ) , lifting europe to the forefront of global security .
as member states advance along this path , propelled forward by technological and operational excellence and innovation , they will find avenues to eliminate unnecessary spending and optimize resource use .
europe ’s defense industry will not be able to make progress without a well-functioning market – open , transparent , and with equal opportunities for all european suppliers .
advances in the defense industry lead to significant positive externalities , such as civil-military synergies and investment in research and development , which is fundamental to growth , innovation , and future competitiveness .
a critical component in the coordination and proper functioning of europe ’s security and defense policy is the european defense agency .
china , for example , has banned shark-fin soup , a traditional delicacy , at official government dinners and functions – a move that contributed to a 30 % drop in shark-fin sales from last december to april .
in the southern city of guangzhou , the center of china ’s shark-fin trade , vendors have reported an 82 % decline in sales over the last two years .
it should not be difficult to spur countries to take action to protect their shark populations , given that a shark ’s economic value plummets when it is killed .
a study by the australian marine institute found that palau ’s shark-diving industry is worth far more than its shark-fishing industry .
a single reef shark that frequents major dive sites in palau is worth roughly $ 179,000 annually , or $ 1.9 million over its lifetime ; the same shark would be worth about $ 108 dead .
tudjman ’s excuse was that croatia needed to concentrate power for its struggle with serbian aggression .
the truth is that he used a negotiated hostility with slobodan milosevic to solidify personal rule and a russian-style plunder of state properties by his coterie of loyalists .
in order to accomplish this with a minimum of fuss he muzzled the press and electronic media .
despite enmity between serbia and croatia , dealing dictator to dictator with milosevic was simple .
because both tudjman and milosevic believed in ethnically homogeneous states , they fomented forced population transfers ( ie , ethnic cleansing ) and a division of territory between each other .
the current proposed arrangements would permit the chinese government to veto any candidate that it did not like , prompting criticism that what is on offer is an iranian-style election : “ you can vote for anyone we choose . ”
the hong kong government could call for changes to increase the openness and fairness by which the chief executive is chosen , without abandoning its current method in favor of universal suffrage .
according to the basic law , the election committee should be “ broadly representative ” – a provision that the committee ’s current composition violates .
its membership is chosen by only 7 % of the total hong kong electorate , and its voting procedures seek to prevent the nomination of any candidates who may harbor democratic sympathies .
since 1997 , 55-61 % of voters have voted for democratic candidates in legislative council elections .
in promoting democracy , liberals reject the argument used by today ’s rulers that the first free election would be the last , because islamists would win and establish theocratic regimes .
reformers insist that the vast majority of people support moderate solutions , or at least that radical islamist groups would have to become pragmatic in order to compete for power and govern .
that case is not yet proven .
january ’s palestinian elections were won by a relatively moderate leader because he was put forward by the ruling fatah movement and islamists boycotted the election .
but in the gaza strip local elections soon afterward , radical islamists who use terrorism won seven of the ten municipal councils .
increasingly , the industry is implementing approaches that have ensured success in other sectors , such as reducing procurement costs and deploying lean principles in manufacturing .
as clean-tech businesses continue to scale up , there will be additional opportunities to improve .
the shakeout in the clean-tech industry has been tough ; but it has also been typical of emerging technologies , and , by weeding out the weaker players , it has made the sector more robust .
this is a global segment meeting a growing global need .
there is little room for doubt that the clean-tech industry can expect plenty of sunny days ahead .
princeton – the economic gloom that shrouded the world in 2008 has led many to ask whether the apparent prosperity that preceded it was real .
we know that in countries as diverse as china , india , russia , and the united states , the number of billionaires soared .
more generally , the top 1 % of the population prospered .
but the gap between the rich and poor widened , and at least in the us , the incomes of the poor and the middle class stagnated.ampnbsp ;
no wonder that many are now skeptical about taxpayer-funded schemes to bail out banks , insurance companies , and even automakers .
their main objectives are to enable companies and organizations to set sustainability targets and key performance indicators ; to monitor , prepare , and disclose comparative data measuring their economic and esg performance ; and to integrate sustainable production and consumption practices in company business strategies and models .
global awareness of this topic is growing .
recently , mark carney , governor of the bank of england and chairman of the g20 ’s financial stability board , and michael bloomberg , a former new york city mayor and ceo of bloomberg lp , issued an announcement regarding market data on climate .
given the magnitude of the task , however , it is important also to ensure effective coordination and harmonization of these efforts with the relevant standard-setters , regulators , and professional organizations .
the us securities and exchange commission , for one , is already discussing these issues , as it analyzes options to respond to investor and business needs regarding esg .
in particular , small landholders need new tools that enable them to increase productivity while establishing more sustainable production methods .
this month ’s g-20 summit and united nations conference on sustainable development in rio de janeiro are pivotal opportunities to establish a more holistic international approach to global economic recovery and sustainable development .
the pursuit of thriving , inclusive economies must be linked to efforts to address climate change and achieve universal food security .
but the outcomes that the world needs – viable financing options and frameworks to support economic transformation , as well as integrated environmental and sustainable-development governance – can not be achieved without political will .
success at los cabos will depend on g-20 leaders ’ ability to galvanize the same level of collective , concerted action that enabled them to curb global recession in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis .
new york – global financial markets in 2008 experienced their worst crisis since the great depression of the 1930 ’s .
major financial institutions went bust ; others were bought up on the cheap or survived only after major bailouts .
global stock markets fell by more than 50 % ; interest-rate spreads skyrocketed ; a severe liquidity and credit crunch appeared ; and many emerging-market economies staggered to the international monetary fund for help .
so what lies ahead in 2009 ?
is the worst behind us or ahead of us ?
good news is not news , media executives often mutter .
and it takes just a minute on twitter or cable news to confirm the old adage : “ if it bleeds , it leads . ”
add to this a second psychological bias neuroscientists are discussing : because our species has evolved to fend off danger , we tend to be more sensitive to bad news .
we react more acutely to pictures of starving children than to reports of improving nutrition levels in africa .
and , of course , we tend to remember those horrible pictures much longer .
china ’s government has apparently begun to appreciate the limitations of cover-ups and stonewalling , and perhaps also the merits of allowing some room for free speech .
this thirst for unbiased information highlights the dramatic change that the internet has brought to china ’s political landscape .
nowadays , the government no longer monopolizes information and the right to process it .
insightful bloggers attract considerably more clicks than do official mouthpieces .
a “ virtual civil society ” is in the making .
new york – countries often devote public funds to promoting exports of their own goods and services .
but devoting resources to promote imports – as china is doing with its inaugural international import expo , which just opened in shanghai – is truly rare .
the annual import expo , which will be part of china ’s overall import promotion strategy , has attracted thousands of companies worldwide with the promise of large orders from chinese firms , including the state-owned enterprises that the government has tasked with making the expo a success .
if the expo succeeds in raising imports , one might expect it to reduce china ’s trade surplus .
but that need not be the case .
london – the historian norman stone , who died in june , always insisted that history students learn foreign languages .
language gives access to a people ’s culture , and culture to its history .
its history tells us how it sees itself and others .
knowledge of languages should thus be an essential component of a historian ’s technical equipment .
it is the key to understanding the past and future of international relations .
while that scenario is simple , reality is not .
the first nagging question is this : will there actually be elections next january ?
prime minister iyad allawi assures the world that there will be , and president bush echoes his words .
more neutral observers - and indeed , the daily news bulletins about bombings and hostage taking and " insurgents " - cast doubt on that prospect .
the probability of iraqi elections being held this coming january must be lower than 50 % , and we can be certain that these will not be free and fair elections throughout the entire country .
atlanta – as the united states marks the first anniversary of president donald trump ’s election , the question of how trump won still commands attention , with russia ’s role moving increasingly to center stage .
each new revelation in the investigation of russia ’s meddling in the 2016 campaign brings the vulnerability of the us democratic process into sharper focus .
last week , congress unveiled legislation that would force facebook , google , and other social media giants to disclose who buys online advertising , thereby closing a loophole that russia exploited during the election .
but making amends through technical fixes and public promises to be better corporate citizens will solve only the most publicized problem .
the tougher challenge will be strengthening institutions that are vital to the functioning of democracy – specifically , civics education and local journalism .
yet , if the ends are clear , politicians are often clueless about the means .
in the us presidential campaign , trade protection is fashionable again .
but , while import restrictions may alleviate the pain of some manufacturing districts , they will not prevent companies from relocating where growth opportunities are the strongest .
they will not protect workers from technological change .
and they will not recreate yesterday ’s development patterns .
a move by army officers in tripoli against qaddafi and his sons might end the conflict , with military commanders getting the credit – and the political capital .
but four decades of military-based dictatorship may be enough for libyans , a majority of whom never really benefited from their country ’s wealth or potential .
when it comes to producing terrorists and undocumented immigrants – two critical issues for europe – arab military dictators have an inglorious record .
algeria in the 1990 ’s is a potent reminder of this , and western governments do not want the vicious cycle of repressive autocrats producing violent theocrats and refugees to restart .
getting “ stuck in transition ” is a third possible scenario , with libya remaining in a “ gray zone ” – neither a fully-fledged democracy nor a dictatorship , but “ semi-free . ”
but , of course , if they were involved in a case against a muslim , that had to be handled in an islamic court .
when a muslim and a non-muslim faced each other in a trial , the muslim enjoyed significant advantages .
first , the judges ’ training predisposed them to give the benefit of any doubt to a fellow muslim .
second , the court staff was entirely muslim , which meant that testimony was viewed solely from a muslim perspective .
third , whereas muslims could testify against anyone , christians and jews could testify only against another non-muslim .
some say that the real point is the risk of attack and the destruction that might occur if weapons of mass destruction are deployed .
they employ something like a cost/benefit analysis based on a subjective sense of danger .
but there is no way of making an objective assessment of fear , and even if it were possible , using cost/benefit analysis to invade the territory of another country would wreak havoc with the global system of national sovereignty and international law .
the better way to make sense of self-defense is to invoke two principles that underlie legal claims of justification in both domestic and international law .
the first principle is reciprocity , which implies that if israel had the right to attack the osirak reactor , then iraq had the right to bomb the israeli nuclear facility at dimona .
most economies are becoming less fair as well , with widening gaps between the rich and the poor .
and violent conflict remains widespread , with the world ’s poorest regions the most vulnerable to outbreaks .
with these challenges in mind , world leaders agreed last year at the rio +20 summit to adopt sustainable development goals ( sdgs ) .
the world ’s governments asked the un secretary-general to coordinate the preparation of these goals by the year 2015 , in order to ensure a seamless transition from the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , which expire that year .
a crucial meeting of the un general assembly will take place in late september for this purpose .
today starbucks employs roughly 182,000 people worldwide – 50,000 more than facebook , google , and apple combined .
an argentine , jordanian , malaysian , or spaniard who can visualize and create thriving global demand for a product or service – just as spain ’s amancio ortega did with zara – is just as much an entrepreneur as the next bill gates is .
from lahore to lagos , mexico city to mumbai , governments are looking at their own populations as pools of talent waiting to be tapped .
it is time for diplomats to do the same .
they should support and encourage job creators and problem solvers , and turn development assistance into investments .
although such politicians often describe themselves as `` rightist , '' their real policies , such as , for , example , those of former slovak prime minister vladimir meciar , are in fact demagogic populist or authoritarian .
the situation of the political right in each central european country is also influenced by experiences that are rooted in history and tradition .
political developments in czechoslovakia during the last 20 years of communism set the czech republic and slovakia apart from both poland and hungary .
while both the polish and hungarian communist parties experienced internal liberalization that allowed relatively large semi-official zones of activity outside communist control , czechoslovakia after the soviet-led invasion of 1968 became a rigid neo-stalinist regime .
when the communist regimes collapsed in 1989 , the communist parties of poland and hungary transformed themselves into credible democratic-left parties that became formidable opponents of the newly emerging political right .
the eu ’s maastricht treaty specifically reserves this tax-and-transfer authority to the member states , a reflection of europeans ’ unwillingness to transfer funds to other countries ’ people in the way that americans are willing to do among people in different states .
the third important difference is that all us states are required by their constitutions to balance their annual operating budgets .
while “ rainy day ” funds that accumulate in boom years are used to deal with temporary revenue shortfalls , the states ’ “ general obligation ” borrowing is limited to capital projects like roads and schools .
even a state like california , seen by many as a poster child for fiscal profligacy , now has an annual budget deficit of just 1 % of its gdp and a general obligation debt of just 4 % of gdp .
these limits on state-level budget deficits are a logical implication of the fact that us states can not create money to fill fiscal gaps .
i certainly do n’t feel safe as an economics professor !
i have no doubt that sometime later this century , one will be able to buy pocket professors – perhaps with holographic images – as easily as one can buy a pocket kasparov chess computer today .
so let ’s go back to india and china .
globalization proceeded at a rapid pace through much of the last century , and at a particularly accelerated rate during its last two decades .
yet the vast body of evidence suggests that technological changes were a much bigger driver in global wage patterns than trade .
specialization in each country allows people to obtain more of what they want , which , especially at higher income levels , includes cleaner air and water .
when trade brings down costs , it can benefit environmental goods just as much as it benefits other goods .
so , is trade globalization , on balance , better or worse for the environment ?
some empirical studies of cross-country data find net beneficial effects on indicators of environmental degradation like local sulfur-dioxide air pollution .
provided that countries have effective governance institutions at the national level , trade and growth give them the means to clean their air .
tokyo – during the cold war , the term “ kremlinology ” referred to efforts to understand what was taking place at the commanding heights of the soviet union – indeed , behind the entire iron curtain .
kremlinologists monitored ( in whatever way possible ) who was up and who was down among the core soviet leadership .
great significance was read into who signed an official document , or who stood where atop lenin ’s tomb in red square when reviewing military parades .
all of that was grammar-school stuff compared to efforts to decipher the regime in north korea , where the truth is far more opaque .
consider what happened on december 17 .
in a desperate , last-ditch effort , the imf is now inventing “ spill-over reports ” for a few systemically important economies , to be conducted at the margins of its country ( article iv ) consultations .
this initiative is destined to fail – as did the imf multilateral surveillance exercise or the g-20 peer reviews in the recent past .
even if massive spillovers are clearly recognized , it is difficult to see how this exercise would solve the fundamental problem behind the currency war : the major players ’ apparent unwillingness to reconcile vastly different national interests .
so what should latin american economies do ?
they surely have a right to defend themselves , whether through foreign-exchange intervention and the consequent accumulation of reserves ( a potentially profitable option if capital flows are indeed temporary ) , imposition of capital controls , or other currency-related macro-prudential policies aimed at countercyclical exchange-rate smoothing .
if china had let its currency float back then , it would have depreciated in value , deepening the crisis .
countries were warned : avoid trade deficits and build up reserves , because they are the key frontline defense .
east asia 's countries followed that advice , and for a good reason : they had seen the consequences of a lack of reserves .
east asia 's governments knew then that the imf 's policies would deepen their downturns , but they were helpless to resist .
the imf had the money they needed .
welfare-to-work programs in michigan and wisconsin served as the model for federal welfare reform under president bill clinton , and obamacare is based on massachusetts ’ health-care system , introduced under republican governor mitt romney .
likewise , from 2000 to 2014 , by enacting a variety of energy policies – from broad climate action plans to mandated renewable-energy standards – 33 states cut carbon dioxide emissions while expanding their economies .
more recently , some states have introduced cap-and-trade systems to put a price on carbon , and many are already on track to meet obama ’s clean power plan targets .
half of all us states have now legalized marijuana in some form , with eight embracing full legalization .
three states have implemented laws offering paid family leave , with a fourth on the way .
cambridge – “ i want to be a part of it – new york , new york , ” frank sinatra sang of the city that has attracted so many of the world ’s most ambitious people , from artists and performers to businesspeople and bankers .
in a sense , this is not a difficult phenomenon to explain ; metropolises like new york city , with their multicultural populations , multinational corporations , and multitude of talented individuals , are rife with opportunities .
but the impact of large cities runs deeper than economic or even cultural power ; cities can fundamentally change people ’s lives – and even the people themselves .
in 2010 , geoffrey west , together with a team of researchers , discovered that several socioeconomic measures – both positive and negative – increase with the size of the local population .
in other words , the larger the city , the higher the average wage , productivity level , number of patents per person , crime rate , prevalence of anxiety , and incidence of hiv .
( it is likely that the eventual winner of the bid will be required to enter into a joint-production arrangement with india , which us companies would not have done . )
as if all this were not enough to decide against america , the clincher might well have been the indian government ’s desire to avoid any further procurement controversy at a time when allegations of corruption beset it from all sides .
a decision made on technical grounds , many felt , would be easier to defend than one based on political considerations .
against this are the unambiguous advantages of pleasing a major new ally and developing a pattern of bilateral military cooperation in supply , training , and operations that has yet to evolve .
at a time when us nuclear-reactor purchases – made possible by the historic deal negotiated by the bush administration – have been held up by us insistence on exemptions from supplier liability in the event of an accident , some regard india ’s spurning of us aircraft as a gratuitous rejection of an opportunity to demonstrate that friendship with india helps america , too .
as a result , the big transnational institutions are lobbying hard for a pan-european approach to banking supervision and regulation ( and implicitly for fiscal bailouts should that supervision and regulation fail ) .
in the case of the banks that required state rescues , european competition rules are requiring divestment and downsizing .
institutions such as royal bank of scotland , which for a time in 2009 headed the list of the world ’s largest international banks , are being pruned by the eu ’s directorate general for competition .
even the stronger banks are being pressed to increase their capital reserves .
in most cases , this means that they will continue to cut back on lending , worsening the impact of the financial crisis on the rest of the economy .
north korea immediately did just that , threatening to carry out an “ enveloping ” strike on the us territory of guam .
trump shot back that the us military is “ locked and loaded . ”
and , indeed , as this exchange of rhetorical fire has unfolded , the us has reportedly been preparing revised military options for striking north korea .
more ominous , according to a confidential us intelligence report , north korea has achieved the capability to miniaturize nuclear warheads , and may have as many as 60 bombs .
the stakes are rising in kim and trump ’s game of chicken .
two conclusions can be drawn from all this .
the first is that we all owe at least some of our success to others , given the public goods that society provides .
this calls for more modesty and restraint in determining the highest salaries , not for moral reasons but for the sustainability of the system .
the second conclusion is that the most privileged classes , which have benefited the most from the solidarity of others , notably the poor , can no longer deny the latter ’s contributions .
but do n’t hold your breath waiting for them to agree .
when sweden ’s did , swedes said no .
they understood that unemployment would rise if the country ’s monetary policy were set by a central bank that focused single-mindedly on inflation ( and also that there would be insufficient attention to financial stability ) .
the economy would suffer , because the economic model underlying the eurozone was predicated on power relationships that disadvantaged workers .
and , sure enough , what we are seeing now , 16 years after the eurozone institutionalized those relationships , is the antithesis of democracy : many european leaders want to see the end of prime minister alexis tsipras ’s leftist government .
after all , it is extremely inconvenient to have in greece a government that is so opposed to the types of policies that have done so much to increase inequality in so many advanced countries , and that is so committed to curbing the unbridled power of wealth .
durham – this year , islamist politics has faced massive setbacks in two major predominantly muslim countries : egypt and turkey .
but it is too soon to write political islam off as a capable participant – even a leading force – in a pluralist democracy .
just one year after the muslim brotherhood ’s mohamed morsi became egypt ’s first elected president , millions of egyptians took to the street , triggering the military coup that ousted him .
morsi ’s political incompetence and lack of vision in the face of economic collapse would have been enough to diminish support for his government .
but his rejection of pluralism and pursuit of an islamic dictatorship , exemplified by his efforts to centralize power in the hands of the brothers and place himself beyond the review of egypt ’s judiciary , proved to be his undoing .
on may 19 , a group of korean scientists published in the magazine science the results of research that for the first time isolated human embryonic stem cell lines specifically tailored to match the dna of male and female patients of various ages .
the next day , british scientists at newcastle university announced that they had successfully produced a cloned human embryo using donated eggs and genetic material from stem cells .
both breakthroughs constitute a stunning advance in stem cell research .
embryonic stem cells are pluripotent , meaning that they have the ability to develop into any type of human tissue .
this carries great promise , in particular , for sufferers of spinal cord injuries and diseases .
this includes ramping up the tradable-permit program by lowering the threshold beyond which firms have to pay , and eliminating exemptions from permits for firms or industries .
such actions would not only boost fiscal sustainability – the additional revenues could total 2 % of gdp – but also improve the efficiency of overall resource allocation .
finally , china can lower government spending ( in the medium term ) by streamlining its vast administrative hierarchy .
in recent decades , many of the largest global companies have taken advantage of new technologies to reduce the number of employee layers , from top executives to factory workers , thereby reducing costs and boosting efficiency .
china ’s government , by contrast , has retained the same six-layer administrative structure – starting with the central government , and moving down through provinces , prefectures , counties , townships , and villages – since the founding of the people ’s republic 70 years ago .
indeed , the risks of a world without nuclear weapons – or only a minimal number of them – are tremendous .
nuclear deterrence – a threat to kill hundreds of thousands or millions of people – is a concept that does not fit into traditional morals .
yet it has worked , preventing catastrophic wars while making people more civilized and cautious .
when one pole of nuclear deterrence weakened , due to russia ’s political decline in the 1990 ’s , nato , a defensive union of democratic and peaceful states , committed aggression against yugoslavia .
now that russia has restored its capability , such a move would be unthinkable .
as the tragedy unfolded , however , scientists gained a greater understanding of the disease .
prions seem to defy all conventional wisdom , surviving pressure-cooking , irradiation , and even incineration at 340 ° c for four hours – treatments that are routinely and reliably used to deactivate all known viruses and bacteria .
furthermore , prions lack their own genes .
the prion gene is provided by the infected individual , in whom it resides in an innocuous state .
the infectious prion then hijacks the body ’s machinery , reprogramming it into a willing executioner of prion replication .
performing arts advocates in europe point to the us where , among other things , music directors of even major orchestras are now expected to fully participate in fundraising activities and be active in the local community on the orchestras behalf .
the same thing , they fear , will happen in europe .
some conductors , not wanting to carry a tin cup as they wave their batons , have rejected important posts in the us for this reason , feeling that it would interfere with their art .
daniel barenboim is rumored to have left the chicago symphony orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands that were being made of him .
but us experience shows that getting artistic leaders like orchestra music directors to participate in fundraising need not be bad for the artistic side of the job .
we should not forswear that option , but we ought to consider others , not least because the security council - whose backing will be politically if not legally crucial - may never support invasion .
it would be odd to uphold the council 's authority by means that failed to get its approval .
the council is more likely to accept an option of mounting a punitive program of air strikes - going well beyond what was done in 1998 - on suspected wmd sites , presidential compounds , the republican guard and other armed-force targets .
this would hurt and weaken saddam , and establish unmistakably the message that defiance of the un carries severe penalties .
the council could also declare that any fresh aggression , or any use , threat or transfer of wmd , would trigger saddam 's removal and his pursuit as an international criminal like slobodan milosevic .
soon thereafter , the inspectors returned to tarmiya .
this time , they knew exactly what the huge magnets were for : to produce weapons grade nuclear materials .
this time , dr. ahmed , the iraqi counterpart , realized the game was up .
some of the inspectors he knew well , having dined with them on collegial terms during visits to vienna .
that he would lie to them so brazenly was incomprehensible to his friends on the inspection team .
but china ’s dizzying rise has also dispelled three leading myths about the impact of economic growth .
the first is that growth reduces inequality and increases happiness .
in 1955 , the economist simon kuznets hypothesized that income inequality would increase sharply and then decline – in the pattern of an inverted “ u ” or a bell – as countries underwent economic development .
given the pace of china ’s economic growth since 1978 , its experience refutes this claim more powerfully than any other case .
china , after all , is now one of the world ’s most unequal countries .
thus , pakistan has taken one more step toward developing a political system based on the rule of law .
democracy , of course , is always supposed to mean more than periodically holding free and fair elections .
it must also mean developing a robust rule of law , granting people enforceable property rights , and providing citizens with institutional means to settle their disputes .
pakistan held free and fair elections in 2002 and 2007 , and is preparing to hold another at the end of 2012 or in early 2013 .
had the supreme court not removed gilani , he would have been the first prime minister to complete his full term .
on the contrary , the cuban government continues to detain prisoners of conscience and to criminalize demands for a society-wide dialogue .
this year , the peoples of europe are marking the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the iron curtain that once divided europe in two .
that 20 years after this epochal event an iron curtain remains around cuba makes this anniversary poignant .
of course , the tourists who crowd cuba ’s beaches are not aware of this iron curtain .
but , regardless of this ignorance and of its economic interests , the eu should insist on the release of political prisoners and use all international institutions to bring pressure to bear on the cuban government to respect the human and civil rights of cuba ’s people .
brigadier general kyaw hsan , a representative of the military , recently told un special envoy ibrahim gambari that the marchers in the streets were “ bogus monks . ”
but we are genuine , and thousands of us – from rangoon , mandalay , pegu , arakan , magwe , and sagaing – demonstrated for peace .
some have said that the uprising in burma is over .
that is what the junta wants the world to think .
but we believe that the protests represent the beginning of the end of military rule in our country .
but plato would probably be most amazed by the world ’s moral progress .
after all , he believed that being a “ philosopher ” meant assuming the responsibilities of moral reformer .
yet , though morality was always at the center of his thinking , many of the moral truths that we now take for granted never occurred to him .
for example , though plato opposed the enslavement of greeks , he – like every other ancient greek – condoned the enslavement of “ barbarians ” ( non-greeks ) .
today , by contrast , even an emphatically non-philosophical person – say , plato ’s “ media escort ” – could easily explain why slavery is wrong : “ a person is a person .
but it is at least as important to address local-level social divisions that have emerged as a result of the conflict , particularly in hubs of violence .
here , local and international civil-society organizations , together with regional and municipal governments , have an important role to play , and colombia ’s past experience overcoming similar challenges should prove helpful .
such efforts must be supported by progress in another area : rural development , which is the only economic issue addressed in the peace deal .
this is hardly surprising : after all , the massive inequities that characterize rural colombia gave rise to the farc in the first place , and the conflict was concentrated in such areas .
( dismantling the narco-trafficking activities in which the farc has been involved may also be considered an economic issue , given the need to provide alternative opportunities in rural areas ; but it is , first and foremost , a security issue . )
glattbrug , switzerland – rising youth unemployment , especially in europe , is making headlines worldwide .
roughly 5.5 million europeans under the age of 25 are unemployed .
more than 7.5 million people aged 15-24 are “ neets ” – not in employment , education , or training .
the youth unemployment rate exceeds 25 % in 13 european countries , amounting to roughly 30 % in italy , ireland , bulgaria , cyprus , latvia , hungary , and slovakia , and surpassing 55 % in greece and spain .
furthermore , more than 30 % of jobseekers under 25 have been unemployed for more than 12 months , and their chances of finding employment remain low .
foreign producers are accused of `` unfair '' competition far more easily than domestic producers .
indeed , if the standards of domestic trade laws were applied internationally , perhaps a majority of firms within the us would be guilty of dumping .
yet america 's supreme court has set standards so high for american firms to be found guilty of predation that few cases are successfully prosecuted domestically .
the trade negotiators are not even discussing eliminating this double standard .
so developing countries worry that efforts to introduce `` competition '' within trade negotiations will only make life even more difficult .
for emerging economies , this would mean being cured of dollarization only to catch an even worse case of libraization .
if that happens , then libra will have complicated these countries ’ monetary and exchange-rate policies and helped trigger a period of slow growth and financial instability .
facebook is betting that libra will trigger a taurus market .
but libra ’s benefits appear as slippery as a pisces .
the libra project is dangerous like a leo , and it will require government regulation to keep it from becoming a cancer .
there is no reason to believe that inclusiveness affects the sustainability of growth patterns only in developing countries , though the specific dynamics depend on a number of factors .
for example , rising inequality is less likely to be politically and socially disruptive in a high-growth environment ( think a 5-7 % annual rate ) than in a low - or no-growth environment , where the incomes and opportunities of a subset of the population are either stagnant or declining .
the latter dynamic is now playing out in france , with the “ yellow vest ” protests of the last month .
the immediate cause of the protests was a new fuel tax .
the added cost was not all that large ( about $ 0.30 per gallon ) , but fuel prices in france were already among the highest in europe ( roughly $ 7 per gallon , including existing taxes ) .
to divide a people in order to conquer them is an immoral strategy that has endured throughout recorded history .
from alexander the great to stalin the cruel , variants of that strategy have been used to keep nations in thrall to the will of an emperor .
we are now seeing this strategy at work again as president vladimir putin stealthily seeks to restore kremlin supremacy over the lands treated as “ lost ” when the ussr imploded in 1991 .
in so overplaying his hand in ukraine ’s recent election , however , putin clearly revealed to the world his neo-imperialist designs .
in the wake of the euphoric mass protests in kyiv , russia ’s president has since said that he can work with whatever government ukraine ’s people choose .
in any case , the active ingredient of the trump doctrine is burden-sharing .
skinner interprets this narrowly , focusing on the need for america ’s nato allies to increase their defense spending .
what she does not acknowledge is that the us is also forcing the rest of the world to share the burden of its unsustainable structural savings deficit .
the us consistently runs both a fiscal deficit – with total expenditure ( of which defense comprised 14.8 % in 2017 ) significantly exceeding its income – and a current-account deficit .
if those twin deficits run at a trend rate of over 3 % of gdp per annum , net us debt to the rest of the world – currently at 40 % of gdp – will double in less than 24 years .
consider , for example , how recent innovations threaten the export-oriented industrialization strategy that has fueled many countries ’ development in recent decades .
by using abundant and low-cost labor , developing countries were able to increase their share of global manufacturing activities , creating jobs , attracting investment and , in some cases , kick-starting a broader industrialization process .
but , for the firms that took advantage of the opportunity to reduce costs by shifting manufacturing to the developing world , there was always a trade-off : offshore production meant limited ability to respond quickly to shifts in consumer demand .
now , technology may offer another option .
by investing in “ additive manufacturing , ” robots , and other non-human tools , companies could move their production sites closer to their final markets .
even wives of men who watch the game at home have got other issues to deal with .
for instance , joyce , my former workmate , has a husband who is a diehard manchester united fan .
every season , he breaks at least one piece of furniture when his team loses .
couches are stained with beer , and kicked as he cheers his favorite teams .
she has changed her furniture at least twice since she got married four years ago .
in fact , has any monster not yet been considered as a potential conveyor of revolutionary ideas ?
the idea that a murderous monster may symbolize a protester or an outcast , and therefore deserve sympathy , originated with the french philosophers gilles deleuze and pierre-félix guattari .
challenging rené girard ’s explanation of the origins of irrational violence and hatred against the other – ethnic or religious minorities who were demonized and victimized – deleuze and guattari extended the concept of otherness to the vampire .
that set the stage for a paradigmatic shift in the understanding of homicidal monsters as the other .
increasingly , such protagonists became a focus of academic attention , cultural criticism , and popular culture itself .
copenhagen – discussions about global warming are marked by an increasing desire to stamp out “ impure ” thinking , to the point of questioning the value of democratic debate .
but shutting down discussion simply means the disappearance of reason from public policy .
in march , al gore ’s science adviser and prominent climate researcher , jim hansen , proclaimed that when it comes to dealing with global warming , the “ democratic process is n’t working . ”
although science has demonstrated that co2 from fossil fuels is heating the planet , politicians are unwilling to follow his advice and stop building coal-fired power plants .
hansen argues that , “ the first action that people should take is to use the democratic process .
according to the inter-parliamentary union ( ipu ) , that election pushed south korea from 101st to 62nd place worldwide in terms of the proportion of female mps , well ahead of 121st-ranked japan .
the increase in women mps led not only to an increase in female cabinet members , but also to a variety of policies and institutional improvements aimed specifically at women .
and , although south korea has slipped to 80th place in the ipu ’s most recent rankings , the fall reflects subsequent growth in the proportion of female legislators in other countries .
the main reason for the increase in the number of women mps was the introduction of a quota system , according to which south korea ’s political parties should ensure that 30 % of their candidates are women .
the campaign-finance law was revised to provide additional government funding to parties that meet the quota , and to reduce the amount for parties that do not .
for bingham , the law must be accessible and – insofar as possible – intelligible , clear , and predictable .
everyone should be governed according to law , insulated from the personal discretion of those in power , and legal disputes should be resolved without prohibitive cost or inordinate delay .
there should be equality before the law , together with adequate protection of fundamental human rights .
moreover , state power should be exercised reasonably , in good faith , and for the purposes for which it was conferred , with independent courts and judicial review of legislation ensuring that government does not exceed the limits of its authority .
the courts and other official adjudicative bodies should provide fair procedures .
it is the extreme right that has benefited most from the centrists ’ failure .
in finland , the heretofore unknown true finn party capitalized on the resentment around eurozone bailouts to finish a close third in april ’s general election .
in the netherlands , geert wilders ’ party for freedom wields enough power to play kingmaker ; without its support , the minority liberal government would collapse .
in france , the national front , which finished second in the 2002 presidential election , has been revitalized under marine le pen .
nor is the backlash confined to eurozone members .
the eu pays turkey in euros , while seehofer pays orbán by tolerating policies that no german politician should .
the fourth factor is , of course , german business interests .
german companies make a lot of money in the so-called visegrád four – the czech republic , hungary , poland , and slovakia – which together amount to germany ’s largest trade partner .
but , here , the hungarian tail is wagging the german dog .
on its own , hungary is germany ’s 14th-largest trade partner in terms of both exports and imports .
brussels – a new controversy has emerged between the european union and several of its main trade partners since the eu decided to include in its co2 emission-control scheme all flights to and from its territory , including transcontinental flights .
airlines will need to acquire emission permits for their flights ’ co2 emissions .
china and the united states are outraged .
chinese airlines have delayed orders to purchase european aircraft .
the ceos of aircraft manufacturer airbus and major european airlines have urged european leaders to step in .
when we in government looked closely at the risks to london as a financial center from being outside the euro , we concluded that there was no compelling case that it could damage us .
but we were never in any doubt that being out of europe altogether was a completely different matter .
yes , special arrangements can be negotiated , but each must be negotiated individually .
and , for the record , norway is a major net contributor to the eu budget – the price of its negotiation , despite not being a member .
i doubt that other european countries would allow britain to operate like some offshore center at the edge of europe , free from europe ’s responsibilities but participating fully in its opportunities .
it also highlighted the rapid pace of epidemiological transition in middle-income countries and the persistence of communicable , maternal , newborn , and nutritional disorders in sub-saharan africa .
but the gbd could do more to inform policy debates and spur action to improve health if it were able to provide more detailed breakdowns of data .
policymakers are accountable , first and foremost , to their constituents , whose unique needs they must meet .
estimates of local disease burdens will be essential for combating afflictions like ebola , checking the rising toll of non-communicable diseases in middle-income countries , and meeting the sustainable development goals relating to maternal and child health in sub-saharan africa .
to help decision-makers make better use of their data , the institute for health metrics and evaluation , which i head , is creating geospatial maps of disease burdens with a groundbreaking level of resolution .
according to a study by goldman sachs , countries like greece , portugal , and spain will have to become 20-30 % cheaper , and german prices will have to rise by 20 % relative to the eurozone average .
to be sure , if germany were to leave the common currency , the road back to competitiveness would be easier for the southern countries , since the rump euro would undergo devaluation ; but the crisis countries ’ fundamental problem would remain as long as the other competitive countries remain in the eurozone .
spain , for example , would still have to cut its prices by 22-24 % relative to the new eurozone average .
from this perspective , the crisis countries would not be spared painful retrenchment as long as they remained in a monetary union that includes competitive countries .
the only way to avoid it would be for them to exit the euro and devalue their new currencies .
one way to strengthen india ’s disaster-response capabilities would be to create the marine equivalent of our territorial army , training selected fisherfolk in how to carry out search-and-rescue operations .
such training , together with students ’ affinity for their fellow fishermen and their expertise in braving turbulent seas , would make for a highly effective reserve unit , to be deployed when disaster strikes .
another issue that risks being overlooked by the focus on urgent and immediate financial relief is coastal communities ’ long-term economic needs .
to be sure , immediate relief is vital : ockhi has completely shut down everyday activities in some coastal areas , causing severe economic ( not to mention emotional ) distress for the region ’s poor fishing communities .
but perhaps it is time to consider whether it is fair to condemn these communities to long-term dependence on fishing .
ramallah – the united states should stop pushing for the resumption of the palestinian-israeli peace process .
doing so might be the best way to achieve peace – a paradox that reflects the huge gap between a peace process and achieving genuine peace .
make no mistake : this is not a call to arms or an appeal for a violent uprising .
peace between the conflicting parties east of the mediterranean and west of the jordan river can and must be achieved through negotiations .
but if one party is more interested in a process than in the need for peace , something must be wrong .
the two world wars and the cold war shaped european integration as a project of peace , defense of the west ’s fundamental values , and common economic prosperity .
but the collapse of communism in 1989 , and the chance to overcome the continent ’s historical divisions , now required a redefinition of the european project .
the treaties of maastricht ( 1992 ) and amsterdam ( 1997 ) created a new organizational structure for the eu and laid the foundations for political institutions equal to europe ’s economic power .
the treaty of nice ( 2000 ) was result of a rather poor compromise .
declarations by german chancellor angela merkel , whose country assumed the european union ’s rotating six-month presidency at the beginning of the year 2007 , are unambiguous : the period of reflection , approved by the european commission in 2005 , has ended .
whenever i arrive in moscow , i am impressed by its new shops and buildings .
but another key aspect of the yeltsin era - its rollicking debates - has fallen silent .
part of the explanation for this is increased official control , part is declining public interest , and part is that russia 's problems nowadays simply seem less urgent .
after the government seized influence over the independent television networks , ntv and tv6 , russia 's media became vastly duller .
the latest fad is for officials to sue newspapers for libel , demanding over $ 1 million .
true , the united states is not denmark .
but it is not wrong to ask what makes scandinavian welfare economies so successful , and what americans can learn from them .
the short answer is that scandinavian countries provide their people with work that pays a decent enough wage to sustain healthy and happy lives .
one need not be an economist to understand that a country ’s wealth depends , to a large extent , on the proportion of the population that is doing productive work in high-value jobs .
according to oecd country rankings by employment , the top seven countries worldwide have welfare economies .
berkeley – on my desk right now are reporter timothy noah ’s new book the great divergence : america ’s growing inequality crisis and what we can do about it and milton and rose director friedman ’s classic free to choose : a personal statement .
considering them together , my overwhelming thought is that the friedmans would find their task of justifying and advocating small-government libertarianism much harder today than they did in 1979 .
back then , the friedmans made three powerful factual claims about how the world works – claims that seemed true or maybe true or at least arguably true at the time , but that now seem to be pretty clearly false .
their case for small-government libertarianism rested largely on those claims , and has now largely crumbled , because the world , it turned out , disagreed with them about how it works .
the first claim was that macroeconomic distress is caused by the government , not by the unstable private market , or , rather , that the form of macroeconomic regulation required to produce economic stability is straightforward and easily achieved .
the g20 should now follow through on that commitment and set a clear timetable for ending fossil-fuel subsidies , including full transparency regarding such spending from 2017 onward and a ban on exploration and production subsidies by 2018 .
second , the g20 must commit to fighting tax evasion and to unraveling the murky system of tax havens and shell companies ( brought to light earlier this year by the panama papers ) used to pump money out of africa .
according to the african union ’s high level panel on illicit flows , chaired by former south african president thabo mbeki , africa loses more than $ 50 billion every year from illicit financial outflows .
g20 members should strengthen tax disclosure requirements , prevent the creation of shell companies , intensify efforts to fight money laundering , and establish public registries of company ownership .
the g20 and the oecd have already outlined measures to counter tax-avoidance methods such as base erosion and profit shifting .
three of ukraine ’s nuclear power units are currently operating beyond their design lifetime , with nine others set to reach the end of their intended lifetime within the next five years .
most immediately , unit two in south ukraine will reach that point in less than three weeks , meaning that the snriu must now decide whether to grant that unit a 20-year lifetime extension .
the snriu will make this critical decision without key information about the health and environmental risks that the reactor poses to ukraine and its neighbors .
though this contravenes ukraine ’s responsibility , as a signatory to the espoo convention , to carry out a cross-border environmental-impact assessment ( not to mention missing the opportunity to consider potential alternatives to continuing the reactor ’s operation ) , no such analysis is expected to take place .
last month , campaign groups in neighboring countries wrote to their representatives at the ebrd , requesting that the bank suspend its support for revitalizing ukraine ’s nuclear power plants until a cross-border assessment is carried out .
curitiba , brazil , has introduced a new model of urban food production .
and oslo has created a climate budget to guide financial decision-making .
at the business level , more than 700 companies with a total market capitalization of over $ 16 trillion have made far-reaching climate commitments , according to the we mean business coalition .
and 289 investors , holding nearly $ 30 trillion in assets , have signed on to climate 100 + , a five-year initiative to engage with the world ’s largest corporate greenhouse-gas emitters to improve governance on climate change , curb emissions , and strengthen climate-related financial disclosures .
as a result , global green bond issuance could reach $ 300 billion this year .
but this was no recipe for restoring stability and growth .
to succeed in restoring a strong growth path , east asia must deliver justice for more than individual human rights violations .
as the proponents of asian values argued , all human rights - civil and political as well as social and economic - need to be strengthened .
if not , advocates of democracy and human rights will face a backlash .
already , some indonesians are nostalgic for suharto 's new order .
by contrast , the virtuous chinese , who save a large proportion of their incomes , were castigated by western economists for their failure to understand that their duty to humanity was to spend .
the key theoretical point in the transition to a debt-fueled economy was the redefinition of uncertainty as risk .
this was the main achievement of mathematical economics .
whereas guarding against uncertainty had traditionally been a moral issue , hedging against risk is a purely technical question .
the main uncertainty in life – the destination of one ’s immortal soul – nudges one toward morality .
having ruled out a grand coalition with either the anti-establishment five star movement or former prime minister silvio berlusconi ’s center-right party , bersani will depend on senators ’ willingness to support specific measures .
but this approach is inefficient and unstable .
as a result , italy – and the european union – is headed toward the kind of political and financial turmoil that followed greece ’s general election last may , when a similar failure to produce a parliamentary majority forced another election the following month .
the crisis in cyprus – which threatens to cause the country ’s banking system to collapse and force cyprus out of the eurozone – could make the situation even more difficult to manage .
italy and greece have a lot in common , beginning with institutional malaise .
for example , in the 1980s , the us entered into such agreements with foreign car , microchip , steel , lumber , and machine-tool manufacturers .
some of the conditions imposed then have since been banned by the world trade organization .
but , just a few years ago , the us auto industry pushed for a requirement in a trade deal that would have granted it a minimum market share of us exports to south korea .
trump is likely to dust off these tools , and to develop them further .
if trump wants to prevent production from moving overseas and encourage investment from abroad , we may soon see companies pushed to agree “ voluntarily ” to outsourcing restrictions and localization requirements .
and us per capita emissions are higher than in any other large country , by far .
the paris accord does not victimize the us ; on the contrary , the us has a world-beating responsibility to get its house in order .
according to data from the world resources institute , the us accounted for an astounding 26.6 % of global greenhouse-gas emissions from 1850 to 2013 .
america ’s population today is just 4.4 % of the world ’s population .
in short , it is america , where per capita emissions have always been several times higher than the world average , that owes the world climate justice , not the other way around .
and that volatility is the other reason why the casino metaphor applies : china ’s stock market can rise or fall by double digits without triggering a wider economic crash – at least so far .
for example , china ’s gdp growth was unaffected ( in fact , the economy was growing at nearly 10 % ) when the stock market lost half of its value between 2001 and 2005 – or , for that matter , when the market then recovered ( only to fall dramatically again after the 2008 financial crisis ) .
since then , china ’s stock market has been a global laggard – that is , until the past year , when it became the best performing in the world , rising by more than 150 % .
and yet the roller-coaster pattern continues : the 8.5 % plunge came when the market re-opened on a monday that followed the largest two-day rise since 2008 .
that rise had been preceded by a loss of nearly one-third of the market ’s value from mid-june to early july .
the conversation again turned to macron .
i tried to explain that his trademark phrase , en même temps ( at the same time ) , which tends to be heard here as an expression of american-style pragmatism , may instead be one of the most visible traces of his doctrinal proximity to the french protestant philosopher paul ricœur .
far from reflecting careful deliberation over an ambiguous choice , “ at the same time ” is the credo of someone suspended in fear and trembling before the unsolvable and terrifying mystery of the double nature – physical and spiritual , mortal and resurrected – of the tormented body of christ .
but very soon we arrive at the question of anti-semitism in america .
on the one hand , it is to be found in that horde of nativists , white supremacists , and neo-confederates who descended on charlottesville , virginia , in august to break some black and jewish heads .
santiago – now that populists are coming to power in the west , a conflict over the intellectual ownership of their approach is brewing .
writers like john judis claim that nineteenth-century americans invented political populism , with its anti-elitist stance and inflammatory rhetoric .
argentines , who gave the world über-populist juan domingo perón , or brazilians , who brought us getúlio vargas , might beg to differ .
yet there can be no disagreement that latin americans have been the longest and best practitioners of economic populism .
in the twentieth century , perón and vargas , plus alan garcía in perú ( at least during his first term ) , daniel ortega in nicaragua and salvador allende in chile , and many others , engaged in trade protectionism , ran large budget deficits , overheated their economies , allowed inflation to rise , and eventually suffered currency crises .
what is remarkable is that it has lasted so long . ”
but it was a recent statement to congress by secretary of defense robert gates that was especially shocking to israelis .
he expressed understanding for iran ’s desire to acquire nuclear weapons because , as he said , the iranians are surrounded by nuclear powers such as pakistan , india , russia , and israel .
israel is bound to fight against this emerging new american doctrine that equates it with iran , or even with india and pakistan for that matter .
political contexts matter , the israelis will argue .
abidjan – on december 2 , côte d’ivoire ’s independent electoral commission ( cei ) declared opposition leader alassane ouattara the winner of the country ’s november presidential election with 54.1 % of the vote .
the incumbent , laurent gbagbo , gained 45.9 % .
the united states , european union , canada , and united nations secretary-general all congratulated ouattara and called on gbagbo to respect the people ’s will .
one day after the result was announced , the country ’s constitutional council , led by gbagbo ’s close ally paul yao n’dre , annulled the results from seven departments in the north , declaring gbagbo the winner of the election with 51 % of the vote .
the decision , reached in less than 24 hours , left many ivorians flabbergasted .
in contrast to last year , when the rush home for the lunar new year celebration was hampered by freak storms , this year millions of migrant workers have already returned to their rural homes .
many will be staying there , because the global economic downturn has hit china hard , costing them their jobs .
littered with a host of extremely sensitive anniversaries , 2009 could prove even more dramatic and unpredictable than 2008 .
fast approaching is not only the march anniversary of last year ’s disturbances in tibet , but also the 50th anniversary of the tibetan unrest in 1959 that led to the exile of the dalai lama and his supporters .
since the riots last spring , china ’s government has taken many pro-active measures , even adopting a “ serf liberation day , ” to defend its record in tibet of the past 50 years , while continuing to talk with the dalai lama ’s representatives .
dealing with the deficit has required difficult decisions – from reforming the welfare system and increasing the state pension age to controlling public-sector pay .
but i have always believed that a country can not make itself richer by writing checks to itself .
we need to make responsible choices to ensure that we can live within our means – and that is what i am determined to deliver .
a government that lives within its means is a necessary condition to secure the economy for the long term – but it is not sufficient .
success also requires taking bold steps to tear down trade barriers and open the economy to investment from fast-growing countries like china and india .
indeed , the recent boom in some parts of the developing world shows exactly that .
second , while pushing the technological frontier is the crucial element of growth in industrial countries , what matters for developing countries is transforming production and export structures , particularly by shifting resources to activities with higher levels of productivity .
the key to achieving this is the capacity to diversify domestic production by generating new activities , strengthening economic linkages within the country , and creating new domestic technological capabilities .
building industrial and modern service sectors is critical for successful diversification .
conversely , de-industrialization and concentration of growth in informal service activities is a proven recipe for failure , as has been demonstrated by the sad experiences of most developing countries in recent decades .
today , few know where the term “ globalization ” originated .
the oxford english dictionary gives as the earliest reference to its current usage an academic article from 1972 .
the word had been used earlier , but in a rather different sense .
it was a diplomatic term conveying the linkage between disparate policy areas ( for example , in negotiating simultaneously on financial and security matters ) .
the oed etymology ignores the non-english origins of the term , which can be found in the inventive linguistic terminology of continental european student radicalism .
without his determination , backed by a highly credible show of military force and skilful diplomacy , iraq 's military programmes would not now be exposed to a scrutiny more intense than that applied to any other would-be proliferator in the world today .
the credible threat of war has been essential to achieving this extraordinary feat .
but precisely because it is so extraordinary it is difficult to see how implementing those threats by launching a war can make any sense at all .
if in the course of inspections iraq were exposed as having lied and cheated this would be a confirmation of the effectiveness of the inspections , scarcely a justification for military reprisals .
the best " serious consequences " of which the un security council has warned should iraq fail to comply with its obligations would be an even more intense effort to destroy its illicit weapons through continuous inspections of the country 's offensive military capabilities : inspectors , not invaders .
though their vision of “ information security ” could legitimize authoritarian governments ’ censorship , and is therefore unacceptable to democratic governments , it may be possible to identify and target behaviors that are illegal everywhere .
limiting all intrusions would be impossible , but one could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism .
major states would have an interest in limiting damage by agreeing to cooperate on forensics and controls .
of course , historical analogies are imperfect .
obviously , cyber technology is very different from nuclear technology , particularly because non-governmental actors can exploit it much more easily .
most of the debt is owed within the state system – for example , by state-owned enterprises ( soes ) to state-owned banks – and the government could simply write off bad debts and recapitalize banks , financing the operation with either borrowed or printed money .
alternatively , the banks could perpetually roll over existing debt , forever extending new loans to repay old debts .
of course , that would produce wasted investment .
indeed , with banks failing to impose hard budget constraints on financially unsustainable businesses , and with the planning system incapable of imposing alternative effective discipline , china is already awash with apartment blocks in third-tier cities which will never be occupied , and with huge overcapacity in heavy industry .
but , as some chinese policymakers respond , all growth processes involve waste : nineteenth-century railway booms in britain and america created huge overcapacity and investor losses , even as they spurred economic transformation .
moreover , namibia ’s government has wisely understood that abundant natural resources can easily become a curse , enriching a few at the expense of the many .
the authorities know that unless namibia ’s natural wealth is invested in infrastructure and its people ’s productive capacities , resource exhaustion will leave the country poorer , not richer .
they also know that it would be irresponsible not to garner for namibians the most possible from the country ’s resources , and are rethinking investment laws and revisiting mining contracts to ensure that that is the case .
transparency is crucial to this process , which is why the government ’s strong support of press freedom is so important .
as president hage geingob told us , the press often says things that he does n’t like .
it is not unimaginable that this type of cooperation could be extended to include other neighbors around the levant .
the good news is that cyprus ’s newly elected president , nicos anastasiades , may be open to such an agenda .
naturally , much will depend on how he fares politically in the current turmoil surrounding the bailout package .
anastasiades , a member of the pro-european dimokratikós sinayermós ( democratic rally ) party , won 57 % of the popular vote on a platform that emphasized economic recovery , and this will naturally be his top priority .
nevertheless , a cautious look beyond the current turbulence – and into anastasiades ’s history – provides grounds for optimism .
yet the head of the commission is called upon to be the dynamic public face of europe .
the commission ’s own internal culture of cautiousness and red tape is a constraint that nobody in brussels much likes to talk about .
it is not a structure that is conducive to political coups de theâtre , and most of the commission ’s work is the relentless grind of eu regulation and re-regulation .
but the bottom line is that at a time when everyone is asking , “ what is europe doing ? ” , the commission ’s responses have seemed inadequate .
for reasons that are now obscure , there is an unwritten rule that commission presidents must be drawn from the ranks of past or current prime ministers .
but it is not obvious that the uk provides such security , especially now that it is on a path to leave the eu ’s single market and customs union .
independence would allow scotland to develop policies that are more in line with other successful small economies – not least by retaining eu membership .
as scotland confronts the strategic challenges of brexit , it will also have an opportunity to develop policies that are better suited to it .
britain chose to leave the eu because it had an outsized opinion of itself .
but it will soon have to follow a small-country model , like that of switzerland or norway .
second , with china such an influential driver of global demand ( both directly and indirectly through important network effects ) , the outlook for the world ’s second-largest economy has a disproportionate impact on projections of global corporate revenues .
and , as china ’s excessive domestic credit growth and shadow-banking system attract increased attention , many companies are becoming anxious .
third , while companies recognize that innovation is a key comparative advantage in today ’s global economy , they are also humbled by its increasingly winner-take-all nature .
successful innovation today is a lot less about financing and much more about finding the “ killer app . ”
as a result , many companies , less convinced that “ normal ” innovation yields big payoffs , end up investing less overall than they did before .
stockholm – it has been one year since the failed coup in turkey , and questions about the country ’s future still abound .
last year ’s attempted coup was nothing if not dramatic .
mutinous f-16 fighters bombed the turkish parliament , and 249 people lost their lives .
but the putschists failed to detain president recep tayyip erdoğan , who then mobilized his own supporters and sealed the coup ’s fate .
if the coup had not been stymied within the first 48 hours , turkey probably would have fallen into a devastating and violent civil war , the consequences of which would have extended well beyond its borders .
seoul – once again , tension is rising across asia over north korea ’s missile program .
unlike its previous “ surprise ” missile launches , north korea ’s government this time notified international agencies in advance that it will launch a “ satellite ” sometime between april 4 and 8 .
the question for the world now is not whether the north korean regime will launch its missile , but what happens afterward .
the united states , japan , and south korea have already publicly condemned the launch as a “ provocative act ” and a violation of united nations security council resolution 1718 , adopted in october 2006 , five days after north korea conducted a nuclear weapons test .
but , instead of hot rhetoric , what is needed now is a cool-headed assessment of the military implications of the missile launch .
and it has just held the first round of a presidential election that meets europe ’s high standards of freedom and fairness .
the eu deserves some credit for this outcome .
it has been a decade since the eu launched its eastern partnership , which established a more reliable framework for the bloc ’s cooperation with armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova , and ukraine .
this initiative , it is worth recalling , was partly a reaction to the russian invasion of georgia the preceding summer , when the kremlin tried to dismember that country by recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
in the event , not even russia ’s closest allies would agree to recognize those occupied territories or legitimize its invasion .
a policy of baby steps is no longer enough .
without a renewed vision of europe and an effective approach to dealing with crises , the continent ’s new ( and old ) nationalists will continue to gain in strength and jeopardize the entire project of peaceful integration on the basis of the rule of law .
the brexit referendum will point the way , both for the uk and for the eu as a whole .
it will be followed either by sighs of relief ( as i hope ) or a cataclysm that rocks the eu to its core and brings disaster to the uk .
but , however the british decide , europe ’s numerous crises need to be addressed .
chicago – now that the dust has settled over the selection of the international monetary fund ’s managing director , the imf can return to its core business of managing crises .
christine lagarde , a competent and well-regarded technocrat , will have her hands full with three important challenges .
the first , and probably easiest , challenge is to restore the imf ’s public image .
while the criminal case against dominique strauss-kahn on sexual-assault charges now seems highly uncertain , the ensuing press focus on the imf suggests an uncontrolled international bureaucracy with unlimited expense accounts , dominated by men with little sense of restraint .
fortunately , the truth is more prosaic .
the increase in the monetary base , however , is only temporary ; when the bonds are redeemed , it reverts to its original level .
this eventual need to reduce the monetary base is an implicit claim on a central bank ’s assets ; thus , the increase is rightly considered a liability on its balance sheet .
under a fiscal stimulus financed by helicopter money , however , the central bank never has to reverse the increase in the monetary base .
because the holders of the distributed funds have no claim on the central bank , the increase in the monetary base should not be viewed as a liability , but as an increase in the central bank ’s net worth .
in other words , helicopter money is not an interest-free loan to the government ; it is a gift .
her party accused serra 's of orchestrating the attack and , in revenge , her party -- the liberal front -- threw its support to ciro gomes .
with sarney out , lula reigned supreme in the polls , reaching 43 % in mid-may .
then , in early july , gomes soared to 28 % , within striking distance of lula who had declined to 33 % .
gomes used the television time available to his three-party labor alliance in late june to great effect , but most credit his rise in the polls to the excellent performance of his second wife , popular actress patricia pillar , who was recovering from breast cancer .
brazil 's severe summer market jitters , during which the country 's risk index suddenly topped nigeria 's and short term credits for international trade dried up , began to change the face of the election .
claremont , california – although the rapid escalation of violence in hong kong seems terrifying enough , things may be about to get much worse .
the communiqué of the recently concluded fourth plenum of the 19th central committee of the communist party of china ( cpc ) indicates that chinese president xi jinping is planning to tighten his grip on the former british colony at any cost .
he should prepare to rack up a formidable bill .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
these shortcomings partly reflect enduring weaknesses in governance , despite important political reforms , notably the 2011 constitutional changes that shifted powers from the monarch to the parliament , and legal reforms such as aligning legislation with european and international standards on human rights , as well as progress on family law and gender equality .
moreover , regional tensions – including escalating political instability in algeria and the thorny issue of the western sahara – have hampered integration in the maghreb , an absolute necessity for unlocking prosperity in north africa .
and yet , despite the challenges it faces , morocco has shown strong leadership on some of today ’s most pressing issues .
it has been a vocal champion of counter-extremism initiatives , including responsible religious education , far beyond its own borders .
it has become a global green-energy leader , having committed in 2015 to increase its share of renewable electricity generation to 52 % by 2030 – one of the world ’s most ambitious targets .
to use eurobonds as the mechanism for eliminating the big sovereign-debt overhang jeopardizes the longer-term objective of eliminating moral hazard : it offers absolution precisely on the 60 % - of-gdp margin where countries will have the most trouble resisting temptation .
after all , there is little reason to believe that the fiscal compact or proposed “ debt brakes ” will succeed where the maastricht criteria and the sgp failed .
rules need a credible enforcement mechanism .
misplaced hope that the enforcement problem can be solved by enshrining the fiscal compact in member states ’ constitutions might be based on a misunderstanding of the us system .
to be sure , the us federal government has never bailed out a state , 49 of which ( all but vermont ) have laws or constitutional provisions that limit deficit spending .
but since the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights ( trips ) entered into force in 1995 , all world trade organization member states have had to recognize one another ’s pharmaceutical patents .
for indian drug makers , manufacturing generic versions of patented drugs would require a license , and such licenses are rarely if ever granted .
nonetheless , following amendments to the indian patents act , india still had some safeguards to prevent the kind of excesses that major pharmaceutical companies routinely get away with in the us and europe .
for example , india abides by a stricter definition of what constitutes an invention , which prevents “ evergreening ” : the process of extending the life of a patent by taking out secondary patents for marginal improvements to the original drug .
according to section 3 ( d ) of the indian patents act , “ the mere discovery of a new form … property or … use for a known substance or of the mere use of a known process ” is not eligible for a patent unless it “ results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant . ”
the foreign actors who criticize brazil ’s exploitation of the rainforest – from european governments to pope francis – are promoting biodiversity only so that they can exploit it in the future .
with characteristic misogyny , he recently declared that “ brazil is like a virgin that every foreign pervert wants . ”
but bolsonaro does not want to keep the amazon chaste ; he merely wants to be among those exploiting it .
his promotion of the rainforest ’s development and attacks on environmental regulation have led , for example , to the expansion of agribusiness , particularly cattle ranching , and illegal logging .
according to data from brazil ’s national institute for space research , deforestation of brazil ’s portion of the amazon increased in june by 88 % year on year .
kim seems perfectly willing to subject the north korean people to privations of every kind in order to remain in power .
of course , there are notable differences between north korea and iran .
the most obvious is that iran ’s nuclear program did not take off , whereas north korea – which , unlike iran , withdrew from the non-proliferation treaty – already has an estimated 60 nuclear warheads , and seems to be making progress toward a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us mainland .
in short : an all-out military conflict with north korea would entail immediate global risks .
trump may have begun to realize that increasing pressure on north korea does not preclude sitting down to negotiate with kim .
the third argument against putting anti-manipulation provisions in the tpp is that they would imperil america ’s ability to implement monetary stimulus .
but this reflects a thorough misunderstanding of the issue .
a well-designed currency chapter in the tpp would not impede us monetary independence .
conventional monetary policy operates by altering short-term interest rates , which includes the central bank buying and selling short-term government debt .
no intervention in the foreign-exchange market – buying and selling foreign currency – is involved .
so it ’s funny to boast that one ’s own brand of knowledge , whether experimental physics , mathematics , or cosmology , is useless .
but the joke would n’t work if there were not at the same time another widely shared assumption that scientific knowledge has a value independent of any practical use .
after all , it would not be funny if a charity dedicated to famine relief celebrated its own ineffectiveness ; practical value in that case would be paramount , because it would be the only real reason for the charity to exist .
so , even though potential usefulness is the reason why governments devote so much money to scientific research , people really expect more from science than that .
on this view , science also has a quite different , higher aim : understanding the natural world .
the position of the united states has n’t helped , either .
last year , us president barack obama ’s administration asked congress for $ 1.8 billion in emergency funding to help prepare for and respond to the zika threat .
but abortion politics intervened , as republican lawmakers , leading a congressional hearing on the zika outbreak , made the funding conditional on anti-abortion policies in recipient countries .
the problems with the dominant approach to containing the zika virus – namely , that it saddles women with too much responsibility while giving them too little power – are not lost on everyone .
last year , the united nations refugee agency and the world health organization emphasized the need to put human rights at the center of the response to the zika outbreak .
if they become consolidated democracies , as hoped , would-be entrepreneurs could stop worrying so much about official corruption .
and start-up loans from europe would make it much easier to seek one ’s fortune back home .
such an approach needs to be communicated both to the european public and to the people of tunisia , egypt , and other arab countries .
it would reverse the pattern whereby europe relies on repressive regimes to supply it with oil and gas and guard its borders against migrants .
at long last , these countries ’ demographic wealth would be used to meet their development needs .
of course , what is advantageous today may be problematic tomorrow : europe and japan will face severe problems when their demographic pyramids tilt towards the elderly , eliminating the temporary demographic advantage they have relative to the us today .
but this is n't what ails their economies now .
edmund phelps of columbia university says that these slow-growing countries lack " dynamism , " which he defines as a combination of entrepreneurial spirit and the financial institutions to channel it .
both spirit and the necessary financial institutions must be present to enable " creative destruction " - the force joseph schumpeter argued sixty years was the engine of capitalist prosperity - to be unleashed .
but is this an accurate description of slow-growing countries ?
in argentina one bumbling president succeeds the next .
institutions are torn down , property rights are called into question , and a random and ever more corrupt redistribution effort is underway .
peru and venezuela hardly look better ; brazil may soon follow the same course .
the popularity of lula ignacia da silva and his team , who lead opinion polls in the run-up to brazil 's presidential election , serves as a warning that much of the latin american public is prepared to reject traditional governments .
lula and his party are so far outside the mainstream of economic thought and policy that capital has already begun fleeing -- even though the election is months away .
by 2040 , in the iea ’s optimistic scenario , solar power in sub-saharan africa will produce 14kwh per person per year , less than what is needed to keep a single two-watt led permanently lit .
the iea also estimates that renewable power will still cost more , on average , than any other source – oil , gas , nuclear , coal , or hydro , even with a carbon tax .
few in the rich world would switch to renewables without heavy subsidies , and certainly no one would cut off their connection to the mostly fossil-fuel-powered grid that provides stable power on cloudy days and at night ( another form of subsidy ) .
yet western activists seem to believe that the world ’s worst-off people should be satisfied with inadequate and irregular electricity supplies .
in its recent africa energy outlook , the iea estimates that africa ’s energy consumption will increase by 80 % by 2040 ; but , with the continent ’s population almost doubling , less energy per person will be available .
in 2011 and early 2012 , there was much talk of a crash in china ’s housing market , and a chain-reaction of defaults in underground credit networks and local-government finance platforms .
in 2013 , the talk has changed to the danger of a resurgent housing bubble and the collapse of the shadow banking system , which consists mainly of wealth-management firms and trust companies .
according to market sources , total assets managed by the shadow banking system have risen exponentially since 2009 , totaling ¥ 14 trillion , or one-third of gdp , in the third quarter of 2012 .
with relatively slow growth , corporate profitability , upon which the returns of the shadow banking system ’s asset pools are based , is low and falling .
where , then , will the high returns of the financial products provided by the shadow banking system come from ?
european industry is afflicted by similar problems .
the refining and petrochemical sector supplies the eu with a large proportion of its fuel , and is also a major source of tax revenue .
the downstream sector , together with fuels distribution , contributes a total of around € 240 billion annually to treasury coffers .
by any reckoning , this is an important industry that should not suffer from overregulation .
but , while the industry faces the threat of inflated gas prices from around the world , its concerns closer to home are the abundance of eu and national energy regulations .
the answer , it seems , is that its centrist chancellor , angela merkel , has pushed back against trump .
yet draining the poison from europe will require a lot more than scolding the us and praying for trump ’s early departure .
in fact , some eu leaders ’ approaches to issues like immigration are threatening to create systemic problems that will endure long after trump has returned to a life of golf courses and bankruptcy courts .
sensible european leaders can be forgiven for politely sending the uk on its way , so that they can focus their attention on threats to their long-term cohesion and fundamental values .
the eu has always prided itself on being a community of values that protects minorities and has welcomed the poor and downtrodden .
acknowledging such thoroughgoing fallibility may seem paralyzing – and the current political mood certainly seems to reflect this .
but recognizing fallibility can actually be empowering , because it implies the possibility of improvement in both economics and politics .
if the world is too complex and unpredictable for either markets or governments to achieve social objectives , then new systems of checks and balances must be designed so that political decision-making can constrain economic incentives and vice versa .
if the world is characterized by ambiguity and unpredictability , then the economic theories of the pre-crisis period – rational expectations , efficient markets , and the neutrality of money – must be revised .
moreover , politicians must reconsider much of the ideological super-structure erected on market fundamentalist assumptions .
similarly , it would be difficult – but not impossible – to reduce the incentives , created by almost all countries ’ tax regimes , for corporate leverage .
governments must also work to reduce existing debt – and the deficient global demand to which it contributes .
it is simply not feasible for the most highly leveraged governments to grow their way out of debt .
nor can austerity alone suffice , as it would require countries to make such large fiscal adjustments – 5 % of gdp , in spain ’s case – that citizens would likely resist them , as the greeks have done .
a more effective approach would employ a broader range of tools , including debt restructuring .
and others are more tangible , like giving away personal data in exchange for access to a service .
third , inequitable pay and incentive structures are bad for business .
much has been written about the extraordinary bonuses paid to investment bankers during the height of the financial crisis .
but the ceos of silicon valley are no robin hoods , either .
tech entrepreneurs might tell their investors they want to change the world , but many are intoxicated by the idea that the world will be better when they sell their business to the highest bidder .
for europe , that is a necessary principle .
moreover , he has never wavered on the critical questions of legal and practical equality for women or about expressing his dismay at the growing number of niqabs and hijabs now seen on london ’s streets – which prevent people , he notes , from speaking face to face .
likewise , khan ’s position in favor of gay marriage has earned him a fatwa for apostasy from the fearsome head imam of a bradford mosque .
one might say that no less could be expected from a labour leader with a bright future in the country of churchill .
but one must still follow through , and it must be admitted that khan has not yielded in these matters to the facile communitarianism common on the other side of the channel .
in europe , regulatory changes like the second payment services directive ( psd2 ) have been crucial in opening up the banking system , and regulators like the united kingdom ’s financial conduct authority have for some time been running regulatory sandboxes to smooth the way for new entrants by helping them to structure themselves to comply with standards .
psd2 , often described as “ open banking , ” requires banks to offer their customer data to non-bank providers of payment and account information services .
aggregators can then present the customer with an integrated view of their finances , and offer add-on services .
maybe the time to assess the financial-stability risks of open banking was in the consultation period before the directive was passed .
even now , the list of contributors to the fsb work shows that the european commission , and the key regulators in europe and north america , were not involved .
some ideas are worse than wrong : they are castrating , because they interpret the world in a way that emphasizes secondary issues – say , the availability of raw materials – and blinds societies to the more promising opportunities that may lie elsewhere .
consider finland , a nordic country endowed with many trees for its small population .
a classical economist would argue that , given this , the country should export wood , which finland has done .
by contrast , a traditional development economist would argue that it should not export wood ; instead , it should add value by transforming the wood into paper or furniture – something that finland also does .
but all wood-related products represent barely 20 % of finland ’s exports .
we need to get to around 50 grams per kilowatt-hour by 2050 , not 500 grams per kilowatt-hour .
we need to get to zero-emission vehicles , not more efficient gas-burning vehicles , especially given that the number of vehicles worldwide could easily double by mid-century .
deep decarbonization requires not natural gas and fuel-efficient vehicles , but zero-carbon electricity and electric vehicles charged on the zero-carbon electricity grid .
this more profound transformation , unlike the low-hanging fruit eyed today by many politicians , offers the only path to climate safety ( that is , staying below the 2ºc limit ) .
by pursuing coal to gas , or more efficient gas-burning vehicles , we risk putting ourselves into a high-carbon trap .
instead of becoming agents of change , they often prevent change .
( indeed , the big economic debate in south korea nowadays concerns whether the chaebols are stifling innovation by preventing start-up competitors from challenging them . )
the productive transformation that developing countries need is much easier to achieve with the support , rather than the obstruction , of their conglomerates .
but ensuring such support requires policies that nudge ( or even shove ) conglomerates toward export industries that can grow beyond the limits of the domestic market – industries in which competition will encourage the discipline that they lack as a result of dominating local markets .
to succeed , conglomerates need the support of government and the acceptance of society .
working groups might be created to try to create a common narrative .
the negotiations would also need to cover contemporary issues , including a tour d’horizon of current hotspots .
what is iran doing in yemen , lebanon , iraq , and especially syria ?
how does it define its interests in these countries ?
does it actually see itself , as many sunni arabs assert , as a protector of shia arabs ?
domestically , china will be the first country that , due to its sheer size and required gdp growth , is forced to pursue a “ green ” economy .
otherwise , china would quickly reach its “ limits to growth , ” with disastrous ecological and , as a result , political consequences .
since china will be the most important market of the future , it will be decisive in determining not only what we produce and consume , but how .
consider the transition from the traditional automobile to electric transport .
despite european illusions to the contrary , this will be decided in china , not in the west .
first , the ecb ’s renewed bond purchases must express the clear intention of reducing sovereign interest rates to sustainable levels , which are at least 200 basis points below their july averages .
a high-level german diplomat reportedly dismissed spain ’s 6.5-7 % interest rates recently , on the grounds that spain borrowed at nearly the same rates in the 1990 ’s .
but that statement , amazingly , ignored spain ’s higher pre-euro inflation – thus confusing real and nominal rates – and more rapid gdp growth .
for countries that are following agreed reform programs , the ecb should commit itself to bringing down interest rates to levels compatible with projected inflation and growth rates , and announce how long ( say , nine months ) this will continue .
a sporadic program without such announced objectives is unlikely to work , and could even be counterproductive , as private investors might well demand even higher returns because the growing ecb share of the debt would be considered senior , augmenting their risk .
but that rule succumbed rather quickly to violent money-demand shocks , though friedman ’s general argument – that a credible commitment to low inflation requires favoring rules over discretion – remains very influential .
inflation targeting was best known as a rule that instructed central banks to set – and try their best to attain – a target range for the annual rate of change of the consumer price index ( cpi ) .
close cousins included targeting the price level instead of the inflation rate , and targeting core inflation ( the cpi minus volatile food and energy prices ) .
there were also proponents of flexible inflation targeting , who held that it was fine to put some weight on real gdp growth in the short run , so long as there was a clear longer-term target for cpi inflation .
but some felt that if the definition of it were stretched too far , it would lose its meaning .
firms in advanced economies are now cutting jobs , owing to inadequate final demand , which has led to excess capacity , and to uncertainty about future demand .
but cutting jobs weakens final demand further , because it reduces labor income and increases inequality .
because a firm ’s labor costs are someone else ’s labor income and demand , what is individually rational for one firm is destructive in the aggregate .
the result is that free markets do n’t generate enough final demand .
in the us , for example , slashing labor costs has sharply reduced the share of labor income in gdp .
nor do import tariffs help those left unemployed by the bankruptcy of blockbuster video , borders books , compusa , circuit city , payless , or virgin megastores .
in the meantime , employment at amazon grew by 47 % over the past year , to 341,000 people .
but with amazon employment concentrated in california , texas , and washington , the geography of those jobs is very different from that of those it is replacing .
as with the geographic relocation of us manufacturing jobs , taa is not a solution for this kind of ailment .
after all , whereas taa targets individuals directly impacted by foreign competition , much of the competition faced by local economies is not coming from abroad , and many of the jobs being lost are not in the industries directly affected by outside competition , but in the surrounding economy .
yanukovych stands for a truly oligarchic state of the sort putin defeated at home , and yanukovych accused yushchenko of having sold ukrainian companies to russian corporations .
president putin ’s behavior is probably best explained by his dislike for democracy .
in addition , if ukraine ’s president becomes an international pariah , he can only turn to russia , as is the case of president aleksandr lukashenko in belarus .
after this spectacular russian failure , however , putin ’s “ managed democracy ” looks anachronistic and faces the threat of a real democracy in its neighbor spreading to russia .
for the first time , ukrainians have thrown their little-brother complex toward the russians overboard .
of course , agricultural development can have serious economy-wide pitfalls , which must be navigated carefully .
for example , as technology-driven productivity gains reduce the number of workers needed on farms , strategies to boost employment in other parts of the value chain and to manage migration to cities become even more essential .
with africa ’s rural population already largely underemployed , there is no time to waste in implementing such strategies .
fortunately , africa ’s large population of increasingly well-educated young people , who are largely uninterested in the backbreaking work of subsistence farming , is well suited to fill the higher value-added jobs that emerge in the agricultural sector and beyond .
another potential pitfall of agricultural development is environmental damage , including land degradation , soil nutrient mining , excessive water use , and water pollution .
it almost certainly will have not .
for many of the agreement ’s critics , particularly those in the environmental movement , these compromises made the lima deal an excessively “ bottom-up ” agreement .
countries have too much latitude to make whatever commitments they want , relatively unconstrained by a common set of “ top-down ” rules imposed by the agreement .
such critics worry that this will make it harder to persuade countries to cut emissions further when it becomes clear that their collective efforts are not enough , and that it may even allow some countries to use irregular accounting methods .
but this overlooks the lima agreement ’s greatest accomplishment : it ends the longstanding division of the world into only two kinds of countries , developed and developing .
her refusal to strike out on her own is probably the main reason why she continues to lead various opinion polls .
nevertheless , recent polls show that a majority of voters distrust the incumbent government and the ruling party .
indeed , ahn cheol-soo , a successful entrepreneur turned pro-reform professor at seoul national university and the main backer of the city ’s new mayor , has now rocked south korean politics by dropping broad hints that he might become a presidential candidate .
ahn has already become a lightning rod for all of the country ’s anti-park and anti-president lee myun-bak forces , attracting young people as well .
ahn ’s most obvious merits are his personal history of overcoming severe challenges and his modest demeanor .
dhaka – we humans do not only share the planet with a range of other species , including plants , animals , and even microbes ; we also depend on them for our survival .
can we determine the economic value of protecting the natural world ?
some people will balk at the idea of putting a price tag on biodiversity , viewing its protection as an obvious imperative .
but they would undoubtedly also agree that preventing human death and suffering , while providing food , water , and an education to all , is vital .
the reality is that there are simply not enough resources to do everything .
in many emerging markets and developing countries , widespread infrastructure gaps persist , notably in power and transport .
and , elsewhere in the region – the small pacific islands in particular – vulnerability to the effects of climate change is increasing .
this shifting landscape calls for bold action on several fronts .
while the response will certainly need to be tailored to each country ’s specific circumstances , some recommendations could be helpful for most countries :
· because inflation remains low across most of the region , monetary policy should remain supportive of growth in case downside risks materialize .
it wishes to remain asia ’s sole country with a permanent seat – a stance that places it at odds with india .
if the brics countries are to jell as a pressure group in international relations , they must agree on what they believe to be attainable political and economic objectives .
for example , they are generally united in their frustration with – but not in their proposed response to – the dollar ’s status as the world ’s reserve currency .
indeed , the most important bilateral relationship each brics country has is with the united states .
the brics concept represents , above all , its members ’ desire to make the global order more plural .
and , third , there was the “ deconstructionism ” of the post-nietzscheans .
by historicizing the “ will to truth ” ( michel foucault ) , putting truth “ in quotation marks ” ( jacques derrida ) , separating the sign from its referent ( louis althusser ) , and miring the obvious in a miasma of charts and graphs ( claude lévi-strauss ) or tying it up in borromean knots ( jacques lacan ) , they probably caused us to lose contact with the simple , robust , and irrefutable aspects of the truth .
i then focused on the responsibility of the internet and gafa ( google , apple , facebook , and amazon ) for the following sequence of events :
first , an almost infinite amount of speech is set free by digital democracy .
the web then becomes a crowd , a free-for-all , where everyone shows up armed with his or her personal opinions , convictions , and truth .
solna , sweden – elite sports and doping have long been deeply interlinked .
but the damning report by the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) on russia ’s far-reaching state-sponsored doping program , released shortly before this year ’s summer olympic games in rio de janeiro , brought it to the forefront of public consciousness .
we should take this as an opportunity to redouble our efforts to end this deeply unhealthy practice – and save elite sports .
reaching an elite level in sports requires a tremendous amount of hard work , dedication , and focus .
by definition , few succeed , but those who do may enjoy great personal and financial rewards .
berlin – with the retaking of mosul in northern iraq , the islamic state ( isis ) could soon be a thing of the past .
but the defeat of isis and the demise of its self-proclaimed iraqi-syrian caliphate wo n’t bring peace to the middle east , or even an end to the syrian tragedy .
rather , it is likely to open a new chapter in the region ’s bloody and chaotic history – one no less dangerous than the previous chapters since the fall of the ottoman empire at the end of world war i.
the continuation of this violent pattern seems almost certain because the region remains unable to resolve internal conflicts on its own , or to create anything like a resilient framework for peace .
instead , it remains trapped somewhere between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .
even rapid response is more effective if key networks and systems – particularly the electricity grid – are resilient .
why do we tend to underinvest in the resilience of our economies ’ key systems ?
one argument is that redundancy looks like waste in normal times , with cost-benefit calculations ruling out higher investment .
that seems clearly wrong : numerous expert estimates indicate that built-in redundancy pays off unless one assigns unrealistically low probabilities to disruptive events .
that leads to a second and more plausible explanation , which is psychological and behavioral in character .
meanwhile , developing countries are moving in the opposite direction .
in october , the people ’s bank of china , responding to the twin threats of inflation and asset bubbles , raised its one-year deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points , to 2.5 % and 5.56 % , respectively – the first increases since 2007 .
in the west , concerns about the impact on chinese growth triggered a fearful sell-off in the markets .
right before the fed acted , the reserve bank of india raised its benchmark short-term interest rate by 25 basis points , to 6.25 % , to fight inflation , and china ’s central bank now indicates that it might raise interest rates further .
in brazil , interest rates remain close to 11 % .
larger firms are more capable of pooling resources for research and development , which is the key to china ’s aspirations to climb the value ladder .
less fragmented industries also lobby better .
traditionally , contract manufacturers in china are scattered and fiercely competitive .
they have little if any say over domestic and international regulations .
producers in jiangsu , for example , were forced to adapt constantly to fickle product-safety and environmental standards in export markets .
no question , the country would be better off with a more flexible exchange rate that eliminated one-way bets for speculators and acted as an economic shock absorber .
but the literature on “ exit strategies ” – on how to replace a currency peg with a more flexible exchange rate – makes clear that the moment when china could have navigated this transition smoothly has now passed .
countries can exit a pegged rate smoothly only when there is confidence in the economy , encouraging the belief that the more flexible exchange rate can appreciate as well as weaken .
this may have been true of china once ; it is no longer true today .
this puts chinese policymakers in the position of the irish tourist who asks for directions to dublin and is told , “ well , sir , if i were you , i would n’t start from here . ”
the legislation was not intended to ban derivatives , but only to bar implicit government guarantees , subsidized by taxpayers ( remember the $ 180 billion aig bailout ? ) , which are not a natural or inevitable byproduct of lending .
there are many ways of curbing big banks ’ excesses .
a strong version of the so-called volcker rule ( designed to force government-insured banks to return to their core mission of lending ) might work .
but the us government would be remiss to leave things as they are .
the senate bill ’s provision on derivatives is a good litmus test : the obama administration and the fed , in opposing these restrictions , have clearly lined up on the side of big banks .
if finalized , the imf program could trigger further aid packages by the world bank and other international donors .
if the aid arrives , egypt could begin to address some of its financing problems , but it is still in need of a long-term strategy to spur sustainable growth .
egypt ’s economy is facing continued risks , owing to capital flight , rising inflation , unemployment , and populist policies .
even with the availability of external finance , egyptian leaders must look for ways to engage the private sector in reviving the country ’s economy .
unfortunately , the latest political incident involving the democracy-promoting activities of american ngos has cooled bilateral relations and threatens the $ 1.3 billion in military assistance that egypt receives annually from the united states .
cafeteria ( now more inviting and more frequented with the advent of free food ) , or the halls of the plug & play startup accelerator , proximity matters .
being physically present at work means direct contact with other sharp and creative minds .
and the benefits of human contact and interaction are why salespeople still call on customers instead of using skype , and why meetup ( which supports organizers of face-to-face meetings ; i am on the company ’s board ) changes lives in ways that twitter and facebook rarely do .
of course , those who prefer to work at home cite not just the cost and time of commuting , but also the proliferation of meetings – too much culture , perhaps – and a steady flood of communication that simply interrupts their work rather than enhancing it .
interestingly , i heard this point at a wpp stream “ unconference ” in phuket , thailand , where a couple of hundred people had flown thousands of miles to meet face to face to share ideas and strengthen working relationships .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
quality of talent , infrastructure , energy costs , and speed to market are assuming greater weight in such decisions .
in the near future , 3d printing could further reduce the need to ship goods across long distances .
if trade in global goods has indeed peaked relative to global gdp , it will be harder for poor countries in africa , latin america , and asia to develop by becoming the world ’s next workshops .
but globalization itself is not in retreat .
while global goods trade has stalled and cross-border financial flows have fallen sharply since 2007 , flows of digital information have surged : cross-border bandwidth use has grown 45-fold over the past decade , circulating ideas , intellectual content , and innovation around the world .
as xi put it at davos in 2017 , china is committed “ to growing an open global economy . ”
xi and his circle obviously will not want to dismantle the global trading system .
but in other respects , globalization with chinese characteristics will differ from globalization as we know it .
compared to standard post-world war ii practice , china relies more on bilateral and regional trade agreements and less on multilateral negotiating rounds .
in 2002 , china signed the framework agreement on comprehensive economic cooperation with the association of southeast asian nations .
part of singh ’s problem is that decisions that hurt voters ( higher diesel prices , fewer subsidized cooking-gas cylinders ) have an immediate impact , whereas the benefits of foreign investment , for example , take years to become apparent .
all politicians in democracies think in the short term ; few have time horizons that extend beyond the next election .
with his 20-year record of accomplishment to show the public , singh has a better case than most to be trusted by voters when he says that he is acting in their long-term interest .
within singh ’s congress party , the pressure will mount to match economic-reform initiatives with “ pro-poor ” programs .
the congress can rightly take credit for the most far-reaching such program , the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme , which assures one member in every poor rural family 100 days per year of paid employment .
banks ’ immediate interest is to adjust to the new capital requirements and restore their balance sheets to financial health , which implies that they will use the ecb money in a way that enables them to meet this objective most cost effectively .
so , for example , if they use the cash to continue financing the private sector , they will ensure that loans go to creditworthy customers .
this means that , like credit provided by italian and spanish banks over the last several months , most of the new cash will be lent locally to safe households and large established firms .
that will allow bank markets to continue functioning , but it is unlikely to inject the type of stimulus that european economies now require .
the alternative is the one urged by sarkozy and the banque de france : purchases by europe ’s banks of their countries ’ government bonds .
but symbolic measures , while important , are not enough to bring about real progress .
turkey ’s government must demonstrate its commitment to ensuring that its laws and institutions effectively protect the human rights of all of its citizens .
in doing so , it would improve its standing in europe and beyond .
turkey has an important role to play in its region and the world – one that is undermined by its continued denial of the armenian genocide .
its disingenuous approach to the genocide is inconsistent with its efforts to cultivate a reputation as an honest , reliable partner .
for this reason , fdi has to be promoted separately from domestic investment and exports .
furthermore , foreign investors do not want to deal with diplomats or civil servants .
they want to talk to private-sector experts who understand the technical and financial needs of their companies or sectors .
yet , except for costa rica ’s foreign investment promotion agency , cinde , modeled after the ida-ireland , none of latin america ’s fdi promotion agencies have succeeded in adopting best practices .
many promote both foreign and domestic investment , despite the failure of such institutional arrangements in the past .
with the paris climate agreement a year old , the transformation of global fossil-fuel markets is only a matter of time .
companies with a large portfolio of fossil fuels , like coal , will soon face severe uncertainty related to stranded assets , and investors may change their risk assessments accordingly .
large mining companies can prepare for this shift by moving from fossil fuels to other materials , such as iron ore , copper , bauxite , cobalt , rare earth elements , and lithium , as well as mineral fertilizers , which will be needed in large quantities to meet the sdgs ’ targets for global hunger eradication .
phasing out coal during times of latent overproduction might even be done at a profit .
third , the world needs a better means of assessing mining ’s ecological risks .
he also obtained the first x-ray patterns of partially oriented samples of dna .
max perutz , a chemistry graduate from vienna , arrived in cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate student with bernal .
the next year , he was given excellent hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best x-ray diffraction patterns to date .
but the observable diffraction pattern -- the intensities and positions of the individual reflections -- represents only half of the data needed to deduce the structure of the diffracting object .
in mathematical terms , it gives the amplitude , but not the phases -- i.e. , the stages in an oscillatory motion -- without which the atomic positions could not be determined .
the endgame to determine the european union 's final shape is underway .
it began with the publication by the praesidium of the convention on the future of europe of a draft of the first sixteen articles of the " treaty to establish a constitution for europe . "
the text mostly replicates the structure of convention chairman valery giscard d'estaing 's " skeleton " constitution , presented last november , and the conclusions reached by the convention 's working groups .
the key word here is mostly .
such fidelity did not hold for economics .
driven by population growth and urbanization , demand is outstripping supply .
in africa , where the infrastructure-investment gap totals $ 68-108 billion per year , firms pay more to do business .
in nigeria , over three-quarters of firms experience electrical outages , costing them over 15 % of annual sales , on average .
similarly , while all companies need data for investment and operational decision-making , official statistics in emerging markets are not always reliable , and are often skewed by political agendas .
for example , in pakistan , a census scheduled for 2008 was delayed by nine years , and beset by problems when it was finally conducted .
the editorial team of the rbc media group suffered a similar fate in 2016 .
nor have the closures spared leading regional outlets like siberian broadcastertv-2 or kaliningrad ’s top independent weekly newspaper , novye kolesa .
each of these outlets was distinguished by its coverage of sensitive stories – from conflict in ukraine to high-level corruption .
russia today has less press freedom and more journalists , media workers , and bloggers behind bars than at any time since the soviet union ’s collapse in 1991 .
in crimea and chechnya , even the most basic media protections are non-existent .
today , countries , citizens , and a growing number of businesses around the world are finally taking action .
this month , thousands gathered for the un ’s climate change conference in bonn , germany , to ratchet up global ambition in the fight against climate change .
following the successful paris climate agreement two years ago , expectations for further progress and continued collaboration are high .
one of the more promising recent initiatives is the carbon pricing leadership coalition ( cplc ) , which brings together 30 governments and more than 180 businesses and strategic partners to put a value on carbon dioxide emissions .
the idea is simple : if we are to meet the paris accord ’s target of limiting the increase in global average temperature to less than 2 ° celsius above preindustrial levels – ideally , to 1.5 ° above preindustrial levels – we must dramatically cut emissions .
once greece goes , runs on bank deposits are likely to follow in spain and italy .
there is nothing to stop spanish and italian depositors from wiring their euros from their local bank to one in switzerland , norway , or new york .
at that point , the only thing still standing between the eurozone and financial chaos will be the ecb , which could buy government bonds and fund the bank runs .
the scale of such an operation would be enormous , and would expose the ecb to huge credit risk .
but it could , in principle , step in – if northern europe permitted .
here , it seems clear that unmo ’s political interests have been allowed to dictate that the country ’s key opposition leader should be tried on charges that no real democracy that embraces the rule of law would even consider leveling , and convicted on evidence that no truly independent court would accept .
political leaders in thailand and malaysia , and in other countries in the region , frequently tout the model pioneered by singapore ’s founder and longtime leader lee kuan yew , who died this month .
yet the path on which both countries have embarked was not lee ’s path .
yes , lee ’s system enabled him to remain in power for 31 years , and he did use the civil – not criminal – courts to harry his opponents .
but lee , more importantly , also relied on elements of democratic contestation to ensure that meritocracy triumphed over patronage .
are all his supporters “ crazies , ” as senator john mccain , perhaps unwisely , called them ?
trump ’s critics argue that he is playing to the basest instincts of disaffected voters , who hate foreigners ( especially mexicans ) , distrust bankers ( or anyone with a higher education , for that matter ) , and still ca n’t get over the election of a president whose father was black .
trump , in the comedian jon stewart ’s words , is “ america ’s id , ” or at least the id of a large number of mostly white , mostly older , mostly small-town americans .
now , all this may be so .
but trump is part of a wider phenomenon throughout the democratic world .
in europe , the picture is also mixed .
the former boom countries – greece , ireland , and spain – remain in recession , and their gdps will continue to shrink .
the unemployment rate in spain , one of europe ’s large economies , has sky-rocked to 20 % and still shows no sign of improving .
the spanish economy contracted by 3.6 % in 2009 , and is expected to shrink by 0.4 % this year .
for finland , britain , and italy , below-average growth rates are expected .
malmö – “ everyone knows ” that you should drink eight glasses of water a day .
after all , this is the advice of a multitude of health writers , not to mention authorities like britain ’s national health service .
healthy living now means carrying water bottles with us , sipping at all times , trying to drink our daily quota to ensure that we stay hydrated and healthy .
indeed , often we drink without being thirsty , but that is how it should be : as the beverage maker gatorade reminds us , “ your brain may know a lot , but it does n’t know when your body is thirsty . ”
sure , drinking this much does not feel comfortable , but powerade offers this sage counsel : “ you may be able to train your gut to tolerate more fluid if you build your fluid intake gradually . ”
businesses are reluctant to invest at a time when consumer demand is plummeting and they face unprecedented risk penalties on their borrowing costs .
they are also facing huge uncertainties .
what kinds of power plants will be acceptable in the future ?
will they be allowed to emit carbon dioxide as in the past ?
can the united states still afford a suburban lifestyle , with sprawling homes in far-flung communities that require long-distance automobile commutes ?
weak mandates , insufficient funding , disorganized structures , and the absence of a global governance system have weakened intergovernmental agencies ’ ability to act with authority in the name of the most vulnerable .
as i argue in germany this week , g20 leaders meeting in hamburg on july 7-8 have an opportunity to reshape the migration governance system with proactive protection policies that would enhance people ’s trust in international leadership .
although past summits have produced little more than talking points , the prospect for action is better this time , given that the talks will be held in europe , where the impact of the migration crisis has been deeply felt .
at the moment , an alphabet soup of nonprofit and multilateral agencies tackles elements of the challenge .
these include independent groups like refugees international ( ir ) and médecins sans frontières ( msf ) .
by the late 1950s there were roughly 2000 computers in the world and their processing power averaged 10,000 machine instructions per second .
there are now 300 million computers in the world , with processing power averaging several hundred million instructions per second -- a four _ billion _ fold increase in raw automated computational power , an average annual growth rate of 56 % !
there is every reason to believe that this pace of productivity growth will continue for decades .
more than a generation ago intel 's co _ founder gordon moore noticed that improvements in semiconductor fabrication allow for a doubling of the density of transistors on a chip every eighteen months .
the scale of investment needed to make what is known as " moore 's law " hold has grown exponentially along with the density of transistors and circuits , but " moore 's law " remains in force , and engineers see no immediate barriers that will bring the process of improvement to a halt anytime soon .
by targeting schools as hubs for health-care education and shaping students into health ambassadors for their families and friends , we can reach an even greater number of people in xinjiang ’s nomadic communities .
xinjiang means “ new frontier , ” and right now , we are at the edge of a new frontier in delivering sustainable health-care solutions to communities where limited resources and infrastructure constrain access to health care .
these multidimensional , scalable interventions help to bridge the gaps in developing regions .
but neither corporations nor governments can do it alone .
they need to work together to achieve the best possible outcome .
fortunately , he still has time , and many previous us presidents have set a precedent for bold diplomacy during their final months in the white house .
in late 1988 , ronald reagan recognized the palestine liberation organization and authorized the state department to begin “ substantive dialogue ” with plo leaders .
in late 2000 , bill clinton published his parameters for a future peace framework .
and , starting with the annapolis conference in late 2007 , george w. bush mediated a series of negotiations between abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert .
now it is obama ’s turn , and he should push for a un security council resolution that establishes new parameters for a future peace accord , and replaces un security council resolution 242 , which dates back to the 1967 six-day war between israel and egypt , jordan , and syria .
loughner ’s shooting of 19 people in 2011 , including congresswoman gabrielle giffords , attracted global attention , as did the court-ordered evaluation of his mental competency .
indeed , on the other side of the world , the newspaper the australian mentioned giffords 160 times in the six months following the shooting , compared to just one mention in the previous 12 months .
though mass shootings are extremely rare even in the us , the media ’s coverage continually reinforces negative perceptions at home and abroad .
in this manner , the us may well be exporting the mental-illness stigma to the rest of the world .
similarly , cho ’s history of mental illness was widely discussed .
it is a key front in the global confrontation between democracy and autocracy .
for europe , it represents a unique opportunity to promote the rule of law , transparency , free trade , and good governance beyond its borders .
ukraine is a large country , with ample human capital , natural resources , and growth potential in many sectors .
more important , successful reforms in ukraine make positive developments in russia more likely .
still , ukraine ’s economy has shrunk by two-thirds ( in dollar terms ) since 2006 , making it the poorest country in europe .
at one extreme lies the notion that the euro can not function like the dollar , given that the eurozone is not a federalized state .
rather , it should resemble the bretton woods system , under which countries could exit and re-enter after bolstering competitiveness through austerity and reform .
but this strategy carries serious risks that ultimately make it unworkable .
realigning relative prices would require internal devaluation , which could lead to social and political instability in the weaker countries .
civil unrest and the rise of neo-nazi parties in europe ’s south exemplify these dangers , threatening the very purpose of european integration .
the problem comes when expansionary monetary policy via standard open-market operations and central-bank guarantees of orderly markets prove insufficient .
economists disagree about when , under what circumstances , and in what order governments should move beyond these first two items on the checklist .
should governments try to increase monetary velocity by selling bonds , thereby boosting short-term interest rates ?
should they employ unemployed workers directly , or indirectly , by bringing forward expenditures or expanding the scale of government programs ?
should they explicitly guarantee large financial institutions ’ liabilities and/or classes of assets ?
it also includes a promise to leave the eu ’s single market and customs union .
the uk ministers mainly responsible for the talks – a group better known for their dogmatism and personal ambition than their competence – have so far managed to secure agreement in one key area : following the march 2019 deadline , a two-year transition period will begin .
but even that agreement is not set in stone , as it depends on whether negotiators can first agree on what to do about the border between the republic of ireland and northern ireland once the uk leaves the customs union .
you can be in a customs union without a border , or outside a customs union with a border .
there is no example anywhere in the world where this is not true .
the eurozone is also highly fragmented financially , lacking a common capital market , a unifying safe asset , or macroeconomic stabilization tools .
the ecb needs a more realistic and flexible mandate .
given the eurozone ’s fragmented nature , that mandate should probably still be centered on price stability .
but it should also recognize that the current definition of price stability – “ below , but close to , 2 % inflation over the medium term ” – is too narrow .
a broader definition is needed , according to which the ecb pursues a symmetric inflation target of 2 % , within a 1.5-2.5 % band , over a longer time horizon .
when it comes to wishing for peace in the middle east – virtually a new year ’s tradition ­ – one needs to be careful .
so many hopes have vanished in the bitter failure of so many negotiations .
but we have a wish for the middle east – one that , while perhaps not bringing peace , can create one of peace ’s preconditions : goodwill .
israel and palestine should jointly bid for , and be awarded , the football world cup in 2018 .
the israel-palestine conflict has lasted far too long .
so the real question is how to get to the point where iraq has a police force and army that can be trusted to maintain law as well as order .
much ground must be covered to get anywhere close .
notwithstanding the courage of the many iraqis who join either the army or the police , no one should be surprised if some have motives that are less than pure .
in northern iraq , old scores are being settled and de facto ethnic segregation is being introduced in areas , such as irbil , that were traditionally diverse .
in other areas , sharia law is being introduced by force .
the differences between the demonstrations in madrid and warsaw suggest that the distinction between old and new europe remains valid , though not in the way that rumsfeld meant .
of course , it would be inaccurate to oppose a thriving poland to a collapsing spain .
given the overall european crisis , even poland ’s economy is no longer booming .
unemployment is around 10 % ( still less than half the spanish rate ) , and annual gdp growth is around 1 % ( spain ’s growth rate is negative ) .
but the moods in the two countries , as well as their perceptions of europe and their role in it , contrast starkly .
berlin – the decision by the united kingdom ’s voters to “ brexit ” the european union is not an example of the british black humor that i love .
it ’s not “ monty python ’s flying circus , ” “ yes , prime minister , ” or “ fawlty towers ” ; it ’s just boris , michael , and nigel and their disastrous political reality show .
given the uk ’s economic , political , and military significance , brexit will leave a gaping hole in the eu .
but it will not destroy europe .
at the moment , the same can not be said of the uk .
as the state of israel celebrates its 60th birthday , palestinians remember the nakbeh , or “ catastrophe ” – their story of dispossession , occupation , and statelessness .
but , for both sides , as well as external powers , the events of 1948 and what has followed – the occupation since 1967 of the remaining lands of historic palestine – represents a tragic failure .
israel is most at fault for this failure , owing to its continued military occupation and illegal settlements .
despite giving lip service to peace , the israeli army ’s refusal to leave the occupied territories continues to be in direct contravention to what the preamble to united nations security council resolution 242 termed the “ inadmissible taking of land by force . ”
but the international community , palestinians , and arabs all bear responsibility as well , albeit at different levels .
reducing uncertainty might augment , or even be superior to , fiscal stimulus programs , for it would address the root cause of the unwillingness to spend .
moreover , recession insurance might , in contrast to fiscal policy , impose no costs on the government , for if it stimulates confidence , then the risk being insured against is prevented .
the government ’s ability to offer such insurance on a scale sufficient to make it costless is one reason to favor a public scheme over private insurers .
blanchard and his colleagues point out that banks might condition loans to firms on their purchase of recession insurance , which might help credit markets function better , addressing a serious problem underlying the current crisis .
tantalizingly , they say that doing this would create “ a market-based view of future output and the likelihood of severe shocks , ” although they do not explain how this market would be structured .
so far , enforcement has failed , owing to flaws in the eurozone ’s foundations .
first , fiscal and external-account balances are to be kept in check in order to ensure financial stability and sustain the common currency .
second , removing imbalances is the responsibility of national governments within the context of a rescue regime arranged by supranational authorities – the european commission and the european central bank – in cooperation with the european council , which in turn represents national governments .
the greek saga shows that this system can not control destabilizing imbalances quickly enough to ward off major crises .
imbalances are not solely the result of irresponsible policies .
as a result , the trade surplus continued to fall , to $ 20.4 billion , fueling growing concern about a chinese slowdown .
china ’s downturn appears sudden ; after all , its exports had been rising at double-digit rates every month this year until may .
in fact , the chinese economy ’s true condition had long been obscured , but has now been exposed by more stringent regulation of activities such as speculative trading of the renminbi masquerading as trade payments .
in particular , china ’s “ two systems in one country ” enabled exports to bonded warehouses in hong kong to be used to pad trade statistics .
moreover , chinese exports sometimes would increase in the face of a slump in the volume of cargo being shipped from ports .
for most equity investors , the value of any project depends to a large extent on effective post-investment management .
clear rights and obligations must therefore be carefully worked out at the start of an investment , something that has been all but absent previously .
after all , an m & a is only the first step on a long road .
as chinese firms invest overseas – as mine does currently in latin america – they have a responsibility not only to invest wisely and sustainably for the sake of their companies , but also to integrate their strategies with china ’s national investment priorities .
those are not mutually exclusive goals , especially if business leaders adhere to the newly articulated principles of sustainable investment and long-term engagement .
and our embrace of our global responsibilities extends to japan ’s self-defense forces .
members of the self-defense forces displayed exemplary cooperation with the us and australian armed forces in the wake of the great east japan earthquake in 2011 , and they have earned deep appreciation and respect everywhere they have been deployed , including haiti , indonesia , and most recently , the philippines .
to make a proactive contribution to peace means that japan will bear its own share of responsibility for assuring the security that supports global prosperity and stability .
working alongside countries with which we share common values and interests , we will safeguard and cultivate international public goods , ranging from space and cyberspace to the skies and the seas .
as the world will see during obama ’s visit , japan is back and thriving .
how can israel ’s preferred palestinian leaders , abbas and pa prime minister salam fayyad , be left with any credible capacity to negotiate if talks can not begin until , as israel insists , they retreat on their minimum condition of a settlement freeze in the occupied territories ?
for all that israel downplays its significance , the arab peace initiative of 2002 still offers a critically important deal : full normalization of relations by the entire arab world in exchange for a comprehensive peace settlement .
how long can this arab league position be sustained with peace talks going nowhere ?
another big question for israel is whether it can accept the consequences if a two-state solution disappears completely from the agenda .
israel , as founding father david ben-gurion warned , can be a jewish state , it can be a democratic state , and it can be a state occupying the whole of historical israel ; but it can not be all three .
nor was it the crisis that gave rise to corruption , which affects officialdom at all levels , or that caused russia to lose its democratic dynamic .
we russians rode along on oil and gas , forgetting that these resources will not last forever .
but , even with favorable world market conditions , we did not manage to solve the problem of poverty , in which millions of russians still live .
i am convinced that russia ’s troubles all come down to politics .
we need a democratic , competitive environment , initiative at all levels , an active civil society , and real public control .
but allowing greece to default and still remain in the eurozone is not an option : it would signal that other eurozone countries could amass huge debts , funded by the ecb , without having any intention of repaying .
fiscal responsibility in the eurozone would be fatally undermined .
yet forcing a defaulting greece out of the eurozone – against its will – is not an option , either : it would plunge the country into economic , social , and political instability , and there would doubtless be serious repercussions beyond the country ’s borders .
in my judgment , there are only two viable options left .
the first – and more desirable – is for the ecb to assess realistically greece ’s lack of solvency and so stop providing ela funds to its banking system .
china , for example , imposes an idle-land tax on formerly public land if its owners fail to initiate the development process within a year .
this brings us to the second key lever to expand affordable housing : a more cohesive and efficient construction industry .
as it stands , the housing-construction industry is highly fragmented , impeding its ability to take advantage of economies of scale , and builders often rely largely on the same methods used 50 years ago .
by standardizing design elements like ceiling heights , fixtures , and flooring , construction companies can cut costs and raise productivity , as workers gain experience with repetitive tasks .
further savings are possible through industrial approaches , such as the use of components – for example , walls and flooring slabs – built offsite .
encouragingly , developing-country governments have increasingly been demanding the hpv vaccine .
this makes sense : of the 266,000 women who die from cervical cancer every year – an average of one every two minutes – 85 % are in developing countries .
if left unchecked , that figure is expected to rise to 416,000 by 2035 , overtaking maternal deaths .
for many of these countries , the hpv vaccine is not just an effective solution , one that prevents 1,500 deaths per 100,000 vaccinated ; it is often the only solution , because the poorest countries lack the capacity to offer screening or treatment for cervical cancer .
this is one reason why cancer experts , government officials , private-sector leaders , and civil society representatives met a few weeks ago in addis ababa for the tenth stop cervical , breast and prostate cancer in africa conference .
washington , dc – ongoing corruption investigations in brazil have exposed a tangled network of illicit relationships between private firms , government bureaucrats , and elected politicians .
the corruption scandals have already reached the highest levels of brazilian society .
several high-level politicians and corporate owners and executives have been convicted and imprisoned .
even former president luiz inácio lula da silva is now under indictment .
meanwhile , the drama has taken its toll on the brazilian economy .
this raises long-term well being all around , but exacerbates short-term inequalities and frictions .
i am not arguing against healthcare capitalism , but warning that support will become fragile , far more so than for , say , globalization nowadays .
most countries rely far too much on command and control , and provide far too few incentives for patients and providers to make efficient choices .
nevertheless , it remains to be seen whether healthcare pressures will ultimately cause the current trend towards free ( and freer ) market capitalism to reverse , with a very large chunk of the economy reverting to a more socialist system .
some societies might decide that it is better to be red than dead .
cambridge – the nineteenth-century physicist heinrich hertz once described his feeling that james clerk maxwell ’s equations , which depict the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism , “ have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own , that they are wiser … even than their discoverers , that we get more out of them than was originally put into them . ”
not long after , albert einstein called niels bohr ’s atomic model “ the highest form of musicality in the sphere of thought . ”
more recently , the late nobel laureate richard feynman , describing his discovery of new laws of physics , declared , “ you can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity . ”
similar sentiments are all but universal among modern physicists .
wishful thinking could never produce working iphones , photographs of pluto , or atomic bombs .
why , with clearly formulated alternatives on the table , did the government choose a predictably disastrous course of action , at such high human cost ?
there are three possibilities : ignorance , intention , and strategic interaction .
let ’s start with the last one .
in a 1991 paper , allan drazen and alberto alesina suggested that economic stabilization might be delayed because two contending groups are trapped in a war of attrition ; all understand that adjustment is necessary but expect the other group to bear the brunt of the cost .
by delaying , they provide information to the other group about their willingness to withstand the pain .
a democratic , prosperous , and stable europe implies a much better and safer world for the us .
here is where the fed comes in .
by shifting its monetary-policy regime to target 4 % annual inflation – or 6 % annual nominal gdp growth – the us would set in motion rapid rebalancing in the eurozone .
rather than see the 30 % euro appreciation that would follow from the ecb ’s current monetary policy , german exporters would scream for measures to prevent america ’s “ competitive devaluation , ” finally bringing about moderate inflation in the north rather than the current grinding depression in the south .
a world in which the us has a proven record of honoring the trust that is required of it to play the role of global economic hegemon is a much better world for the us than one in which it is not trusted .
and a group of 47 republican senators wrote a letter to iran ’s leaders announcing that the next congress may not honor whatever nuclear deal they reach with obama .
another source of doubt about america ’s enduring influence lies in the fact that multilateral engagement is still needed , and this is always more difficult than bilateral engagement .
indeed , multilateral leadership requires not only clearer and bolder rules , but also a demonstrated willingness to bear the costs of those rules , whether by creating safe zones to uphold the “ responsibility to protect ” civilians or taking concrete steps to reduce – and eventually eliminate – nuclear arsenals .
bilateral engagement will prove to be one of obama ’s most important foreign-policy legacies .
but ensuring that the us can continue to lead in the twenty-first century will require a different kind of engagement .
caracas – venezuelan president nicolás maduro and his administration have ruined their country .
while they claim to be redeemers of the poor and trumpet their readiness to fight for their “ selfless ” bolivarian cause , they refuse international assistance , forcing venezuelans either to emigrate or suffer ( and , in many cases , die ) from severe shortages of food , medicines , and medical supplies .
the destruction of venezuela must be stopped urgently if its viability as a state and a society is to be reestablished .
that requires a new government of unquestionable legitimacy , chosen through a free and fair presidential election before the end of this year , as dictated by the constitution .
to be sure , maduro and his associates will not simply step down , as losing power would likely mean long prison terms in the united states for drug trafficking or in the hague for crimes against humanity .
so far , china has largely taken a “ field of dreams ” approach to urbanization : “ build it , and they will come . ”
indeed , over the last 30 years , massive public investment and economic liberalization spurred rapid urban growth in coastal provinces .
and now china ’s leaders are increasingly taking that strategy inland , making critical investments in physical and human capital .
but the effectiveness of these investments will depend on the sequence and rate of their implementation , and on how skillfully they are adapted to each locality ’s distinct resources , needs , and aspirations .
four interrelated issues must be addressed .
if china really is distancing itself from north korea , kim jong-un ’s regime will be almost entirely isolated internationally .
will kim respond to that isolation recklessly , by continuing to antagonize the south , or pragmatically , by becoming more flexible ?
that is not an easy question to answer .
it should be clear to kim by now that his parade of provocations is not benefiting his country .
his bellicose behavior in 2013 , for example , worsened his relationships with china , south korea , and the united states simultaneously ; and in the recent crisis , all he earned was a halt to mocking loudspeaker broadcasts .
the only thing that has changed since then is the growth of islamic fundamentalism and the religious radicalization of some young people .
only french prime minister manuel valls – the son of spanish immigrants – has highlighted the issue , referring to the “ social and ethnic apartheid ” that has developed in his country .
the need to address this outcome in france and across europe has become more important than ever , as rioting and criminality by young and underprivileged immigrants are matched by the rise of far-right political parties .
europe can not afford ethnic confrontation ; on the contrary , with their aging , shrinking populations , european countries badly need more immigrants .
the statistics are confusing and sometimes contradictory , but the european union ’s current foreign-born population of some 33 million may grow by a further 100 million immigrants by mid-century .
countries where english is not the lingua franca are particularly disadvantaged in science , not because they lack academic excellence , but because english-language journals call the shots .
non-english academic journals simply do not command the same attention in the science community .
as a result , the scope of research topics that many countries can undertake is limited , and they must struggle to retain scientific talent .
this is particularly true in the middle east , where governments are struggling to diversify their economies , in order to make them more resilient .
as english-language empirical-research journals consolidate their hold on the channels that determine whether or not a scientist will have a successful career , developing countries will have to invest heavily in their own data infrastructure to place domestic researchers on a more competitive footing .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
at this week ’s international monetary fund-world bank spring meetings , malpass needs to address these concerns head-on .
he should be judged not by his past , or by his links to the trump administration , but by his delivery .
there are essentially two competing explanations .
the first , the secular stagnation hypothesis , has been proposed by larry summers .
its key premise is that the equilibrium interest rate at which demand would balance supply is currently below the actual interest rate .
this seems paradoxical , because interest rates are close to zero in most advanced economies .
but what matters is the real rate of interest , that is , the difference between the market rate and inflation .
for their part , african players grumbled that their absence from europe reduced their commercial opportunities during a crucial period of league play .
but the most important lesson revealed by the africa cup is that successful nations are those that combine globalization ’s opportunities with strong domestic foundations .
for the winner of the cup was not cameroon or cote d’ivoire or any of the other african teams loaded with star players from european leagues , but egypt , which fielded only four players ( out of 23 ) who play in europe .
by contrast , cameroon , which egypt defeated in the final , featured just a single player from a domestic club , and 20 from european clubs .
few egyptian players would have been familiar to europeans who watched that game , but egypt played much better and deserved to win .
berlin – the world ’s task in addressing north korea ’s saber rattling is made no easier by the fact that it confronts an impoverished and effectively defeated country .
on the contrary , it is in such circumstances that calm foresight is most necessary .
the genius of the habsburg empire ’s prince klemens von metternich in framing a new international order after the napoleonic wars was that he did not push a defeated france into a corner .
although metternich sought to deter any possible french resurgence , he restored france ’s prewar frontiers .
by contrast , as henry kissinger has argued , the victors in world war i could neither deter a defeated germany nor provide it with incentives to accept the versailles treaty .
sometimes dating a recession is a judgment call .
america had a brief , sharp recession in 1980 , followed by a long and severe one in 1981/1982 .
many economists believe that it was one major episode , and that is probably the appropriate way to think about it in a broader historical context .
but the economy did indeed grow in the interim – just barely enough to consider them distinct recessions .
and , since they were separated by a transition from president jimmy carter to president ronald reagan , it was politically consequential that two recessions were identified .
in the 1990s , for example , sanctions regimes were introduced at an average rate of about seven per year .
of the 67 cases in that decade , two-thirds were unilateral sanctions imposed by the united states .
during bill clinton ’s presidency , it is estimated that around 40 % of the world ’s population , or 2.3 billion people , were subject to some form of us sanctions .
in fact , the great majority of sanctions are imposed by large countries against small countries .
currently , the us has nearly 8,000 sanctions in place worldwide , with iran by far the largest state target .
in the same tweet justifying his phone call with tsai , he repeated a false charge that china is devaluing its currency to gain export advantages vis-à-vis the us .
his knowledge of international economics is either non-existent or ten years out of date .
in reality , china is now hemorrhaging foreign-exchange reserves and desperately trying to prop up the renminbi ’s value in the face of capital flight .
trump is apparently antagonizing china for no good reason .
worse , by announcing that the us will withdraw from the trans-pacific partnership – designed , at least in part , to shape global trade and investment flows according to western rules , rather than china ’s mercantilist vision – trump is also abandoning a us policy that could have checked china ’s surging influence in asia .
what we do know is that there is no alternative great power willing and able to step in and assume what had been the us role .
china is a frequently mentioned candidate , but its leadership is focused mostly on consolidating domestic order and maintaining artificially high economic-growth rates to stave off popular unrest .
china ’s interest in regional and global institutions seems designed mostly to bolster its economy and geopolitical influence , rather than to help set rules and create broadly beneficial arrangements .
likewise , russia is a country with a narrowly-based economy led by a government focused on retaining power at home and re-establishing russian influence in the middle east and europe .
india is preoccupied with the challenge of economic development and is tied down by its problematic relationship with pakistan .
beijing – china ’s annual gdp growth slowed to 7.6 % in the second quarter of 2012 , down from 8.1 % in the first quarter and the lowest growth rate since the second quarter of 2009 .
the newly released growth data may have dispelled fears of a hard landing for china , but have nonetheless prompted many to argue that china must stimulate its economy further to guarantee 8 % annual growth .
since early 2010 , in order to contain inflation and property bubbles , the chinese government has tightened monetary policy .
as a result , inflation fell in june to 2.2 % , a 29-month low , and house prices , for which the national bureau of statistics unfortunately has stopped issuing official data , seem to be stabilizing , and may even have fallen , albeit modestly .
the slowdown in china ’s growth rate is , to a certain extent , a reflection of the success of the government ’s effort to rein in the real-estate bubble , as well as of other official policies aimed at rebalancing the economy .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
from a moral standpoint , there is a strong case to be made for respecting a woman ’s personal freedom and bodily autonomy , rather than forcing her to put her health or wellbeing at risk by carrying an unwanted or unsafe pregnancy to term .
yet , given how rife with misinformation and muddied by misplaced arguments the issue is , policy debates often go nowhere unless they frame abortion first and foremost as a health matter .
the world ’s enduring perception of africa as a village exacerbates slum dwellers ’ plight , keeping them off the global development agenda .
every day , more people arrive in nairobi , lured by the promise of employment , resources , and a better life , only to realize that they are not equipped to survive there and that their children will grow up in a slum .
at least half of those living in urban slums are under the age of 20 .
without access to education , this generation – which will soon be the majority – has little hope of ever escaping its straitened conditions .
but for how long will a majority serve a minority ? for how long will it accept a lack of water , sanitation , education , and dignity ?
the problem is that the principle can not be applied consistently .
the world in which we live is a small garden of well-explored territory surrounded by a dim and dark forest of disasters .
disasters lurking in the distance are legion : asteroids and comets ; world-wide pandemics and plagues ; nuclear and non-nuclear wars ; droughts , famines , and floods ; volcanic eruptions , earthquakes , and tsunamis ; human over-population and extinction of non-humans ; rising temperatures and sea-levels ; falling temperatures and spreading ice ages ; exhaustion of clean air and water ; disappearance of forests , farms , and fish .
all these disasters – and many others still to be imagined – are possible , and many of them are unacceptable .
the precautionary principle prescribes action , regardless of cost , to prevent all of them .
milan – for much of the post-world war ii period , economic policy has focused on unemployment .
the massive job losses of the great depression – reversed only when world war ii , and the massive debt accumulated to finance it , kick-started economic growth – had a lasting impact on at least two generations .
but employment is just one facet of welfare , and in today ’s world , it is not enough .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
the cold war of the twentieth century pitted two rival military alliances against each other .
by contrast , the sino-american rivalry involves two economies that are closely integrated both with each other and with the rest of the world .
the way in which the inhabitants of this archipelago were systematically dispossessed and thrown off their land in the name of western strategic interests is a human tragedy for which the west can and should make restitution .
between 1968 and 1973 , british labour and conservative governments organized the removal of everyone living on the 55 islands that now constitute the british indian ocean territory ( biot ) , and that were split off from mauritius at the time of its independence .
this was done at the behest of the united states , which at the time was embroiled in the vietnam war and required , for understandable security reasons , the use of the island of diego garcia as an air and naval base .
the british foreign office claimed at the time that the chagos islands had no settled population .
the chagossians were shipped off to the seychelles and mauritius , where they were deposited and left to fend for themselves .
islamabad – last year , pakistan witnessed the second successful democratic transition in its 71-year history , with prime minister imran khan taking office after his party won the general election on an anti-corruption slogan .
hopes are high for the new administration , which seems willing to work with both technocrats and opposition parties to address pakistan ’s many urgent challenges .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
the targeted killing by the united states of one of iran 's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the iranian regime , but it does not augur all-out war .
owing to the 2010 dodd-frank act , the fed can issue emergency collateralized funding only to at least five eligible institutions – something of a problem if only your four largest banks are in trouble – and it must confirm that a counterparty is financially viable before any funding can be made available .
but the task of establishing whether a troubled entity is viable is best left for after financial order has been restored .
as the term implies , “ emergency ” liquidity must be made available to systemically important financial institutions immediately – even when they are insolvent and in resolution .
in any case , the countercyclical pursuit of price stability and/or full employment during cyclical downturns now seems destined for an extended involuntary holiday .
unless governments come to the rescue with intelligently designed countercyclical fiscal and supply-side policies , the major advanced economies are likely to embark on a long spell of classic , unadulterated cyclical downturns .
fiscal adjustment and structural reform without financing is more fragile and liable to fail without a war chest of liquidity to prevent a run on public debt while the appropriate policies are implemented and gradually gain credibility .
at the same time , if greece does not fully adjust its policies to restore fiscal sustainability and competitiveness , a partial bailout by the eu and the ecb will still be likely in order to avoid the risk of contagion to the rest of the euro zone and the consequent threat to the monetary union ’s survival .
a default by greece , after all , could have the same global systemic effects as the collapse of lehman brothers did in 2008 .
sovereign spreads are already pricing the risk of a domino effect from greece to spain , portugal , and other euro-zone members .
the eu and the ecb are worried about the moral hazard of any “ bailout . ”
sharing a mountainous - and porous - border with afghanistan , this region includes many taliban sympathizers among their fellow pashtuns .
human rights groups have long urged the necessity of extending the writ of pakistan 's constitution to the tribal belt , where religion-based parties have wide support .
these religious parties , a coalition of which now heads the provincial government in the north west frontier province , were politically marginalized until given a central role by pakistan 's military dictator of the 1980 's , general zia ul haq , who led pakistan 's covert intervention in the war against the soviet occupation of afghanistan .
throughout his rule , religion-based politics grew along with the number of madrassahs and fighters trained and equipped by pakistani and us intelligence agencies .
the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and subsequent pressure from washington , led to a u-turn by pakistan away from pro-jihadi policies .
throughout its history , america has always tried to insulate its markets from foreign competition .
so history has once more triumphed over ideology .
with america 's loss of interest the chief prop of neo-liberal policies has been pulled away .
mainstream politicians may still nod reverently when the global free market is invoked , but in practice the world is reverting to an older and more durable model .
it is being tacitly accepted that in future , as in the past , the world will contain a variety of economic systems and regimes .
the first few years of his rule were dominated by his struggle to gain control of the country ’s state-owned oil company , pdvsa .
upon reasserting political control in 2003 , chávez fired 40 % of pdvsa ’s staff .
his hostility to foreign players in the industry ( he expropriated several american oil companies ’ holdings in 2007 ) limited investment and held back production .
chávez turned pdvsa into a personal fiefdom and used it as a cash cow ; many of his social programs were funded directly from the company ’s budget .
starved of cash , pdvsa was forced to cut back on maintenance and expansion , which increased the number of accidents and limited production .
an armed attack by the united states , israel , or both on iran ’s nuclear facilities is another possibility .
one downside of such a prospect that iran would likely retaliate against us interests and personnel in iraq and afghanistan , and , using hamas and hezbollah , against israel and others .
iran could also interfere with oil traffic , leading to a spike in prices and delivering a further blow to american and global economic recovery .
moreover , while a preventive strike would delay iran ’s nuclear efforts , it would not stop the regime from rebuilding , and it might also create conditions that cause problems for the regime ’s domestic opponents .
but , despite these potential drawbacks , an armed attack on iran ’s nuclear facilities will and should remain a distinct possibility given the enormous strategic costs of a nuclear-armed iran .
lord north is remembered for losing the british union with america .
two centuries on , the outgoing prime minister , david cameron , may be remembered for losing two unions – with europe and between england and scotland .
whereas conservatives want scotland to be in a britain without europe , scottish nationalists want scotland in a europe without britain .
and with northern ireland ’s republicans , led by sinn fein , demanding a vote to reunite with the south , the very existence of the uk is now squarely on the agenda .
there is one way to lessen uncertainty and risk : the government should quickly announce that it will be negotiating with the eu on the basis of the norway option of membership of the eea .
a power-sharing agreement is all but unthinkable , and syria ’s geography is not well suited to an orderly division along sectarian lines .
assad ’s war aims have been reduced to avoiding decisive defeat and gaining international legitimacy , in the hope of a favorable political solution .
the rise of the islamic state did lend support to the government ’s claims that syria risks being taken over by terrorist groups ; nonetheless , the regime is finding itself increasingly isolated .
assad ’s final days are unlikely to be pretty .
the tight-knit members of his clan , his political allies , and many members of the alawite minority will be fighting for their survival .
if the super-rich believe that they are no longer part of society and have little need of government , it is not because this belief corresponds to objective reality .
it is because the prevailing story line of our time portrays markets as self-standing entities that run on their own fuel .
this is a narrative that afflicts all segments of society , the middle class no less than the rich .
there is no reason to expect that the super-rich will act less selfishly than any other group .
but it is not so much their self-interest that stands in the way of greater equality and social inclusion .
but , though it can explain why capital spending has been weak and interest rates have been low for the last three years , it can not account for why capital expenditure has been insufficient to prevent rates from trending down for more than three decades .
here , the only explanation still standing is the shift in the composition of activity away from capital-intensive forms of production , like manufacturing , to less capital-intensive activities , like services .
if the disorder has multiple causes , then there should be multiple treatments .
there should be tax incentives for firms to hire the long-term unemployed ; more public spending on infrastructure , education , and research to compensate for the shortfall in private capital spending ; and still higher capital requirements for banks and strengthened regulation of nonbank financial institutions to prevent them from excessive risk-taking .
finally , central banks should set a higher inflation target , which would give them more room to cut nominal interest rates in response to a future slowdown .
the supposedly civilizing influence of being a western partner — chairing a g-8 summit in saint petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on putin ’s kremlin cabal .
once again exposure to western values has delivered another potemkin village ; russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions , but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule .
the danger for the world is that putin ’s lawlessness is being exported .
across russia ’s near abroad , a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root .
look at putin ’s attempt to rig ukraine ’s previous presidential election , and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader yuliya tymoshenko .
in latin america , many people live with outstretched hands .
throughout the hemisphere , paternalistic governments accustom people to receiving just enough to survive instead of participating in society .
across the region , politicians that writer octavio paz once referred to as “ philanthropic ogres ” create clients instead of citizens , people who expect instead of demand .
democratic latin america limps sideways because it ca n’t run ahead .
there are too many entry barriers to the poor , the innovative , and those without access to credit .
two examples of this are the wef ’s global competitiveness index and its new inclusive growth and development index .
for example , competitiveness has to do with the ability to increase market share without sacrificing margins or lowering wages , something that reflects superior productivity .
the inclusiveness of growth has to do with the disparities of income and growth across different regions and social groups .
but this is not what these indexes really measure .
instead , the indexes include variables – what they refer to as the “ policy space ” – that are supposed to cause either competitiveness or inclusive growth .
from the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s on , those writing about the netherlands often lamented the “ dutch disease . ”
there were so many generous subsidies , grants , and transfer payments – aimed at everyone from the truly needy to artists unable to sell their work – that after-tax wages were often barely higher than benefits .
so people rarely returned to work after they lost or left a job , or did so in the underground economy , with its unreported cash payments .
whether one considered the dutch welfare state humane and generous , or bloated and foolhardy , its largesse took a heavy toll on the economy .
but unlike , say , the french , the dutch have responded to their past excesses with a series of policies designed to promote a return to work in the formal labor market .
yet significant segments of the global financial and economic elite seem to think that unless the us falls into recession in the coming months , trump will be re-elected .
moreover , their prognosis is not only based on a fear of being wrong again ; many seem resigned to such a result , and some may even be hoping for it .
at this point , the comparison with the 1930s inevitably comes to mind .
of course , trump and adolf hitler have little in common .
but in their apparent acceptance of trump ’s re-election , large parts of the liberal establishment are behaving like germany ’s financial and industrial elites when hitler rose to power in the 1930s .
to avoid such a future , asian countries need to change the rules of the game , providing opportunities for youth , whatever their background , to ascend the income ladder .
market mechanisms are not enough to achieve this .
governments must take action , complementing their pro-growth policies with policies aimed at ensuring that the gains are shared much more equally and sustainably .
to be sure , some asian governments have been attempting to tackle inequality with progressive redistribution policies .
for example , south korea ’s government recently announced that it will raise the minimum wage next year by 16.4 % , to 7,530 won ( $ 6.70 ) per hour , and up to 55 % above its current level by 2020 .
the egyptian defenses blocked the central highway across the sinai with a fortified box containing powerful artillery and more than a hundred tanks , fronted by three parallel trench-lines manned by thousands of infantrymen and anchored on sand dunes and high ground at each end .
sharon had his troops climb over the sand dunes to enter the trench lines at their top end and attack down their length – a simple maneuver that the egyptians could have defeated had they not been pinned down by an artillery barrage and israeli tanks firing directly at them .
the israeli infantrymen had taped flashlights to their helmets so that the tank gunners could direct their fire at the egyptians just ahead of them .
still , the egyptian artillery was superior , and should have at least silenced the tanks firing at the trench line .
but paratroopers , flown in by helicopters , suddenly jumped the egyptian gun crews , who never had a chance in hand-to-hand combat .
in the longer term , countries should aim to match participation rates in conventional first-aid courses .
in the last three years , 11 % of australia ’s population has completed such a course , partly owing to requirements that people in certain positions , such as child-care workers , have a first-aid certificate .
requiring that people in particular occupations – including high-school teachers , nurses , and police officers – acquire a mental-health first-aid certificate would significantly enhance participation , thereby strengthening support for those who are struggling with mental-health problems .
such certifications are even more important in the developing world , given the limited availability of mental-health professionals .
pilot work in rural india shows that the mental-health first-aid approach can be successfully adapted to the needs of communities with limited resources .
the costs of producing these drugs , however , are much less than the market price , perhaps as low as $ 350 - $ 500 per year for some of the three-drug combinations used to treat aids .
some quality producers of generic drugs , such as cipla of india , have offered to provide these drugs at prices near to the cost of production .
in response to this offer ( and to bad publicity ) , merck , abbott laboratories , and bristol myers squibb , three large patent-holding companies , announced that their willingness to supply the african market at " zero profit " – ie , at around $ 500 per patient per year for the aids drugs they produce .
the tragedy of millions of impoverished people dying of aids even when drugs exist to treat them raises deep questions about global intellectual property rights , because patent protection is creating a barrier to essential medicines reaching the world 's poor .
but how can the benefits of a global patent system that provides incentives for innovation and new discoveries be combined with an assurance that poor people gain access to the medical care that they desperately need ?
but what if populist movements ’ continued electoral success helps to drive forward a broader political restructuring that ultimately strengthens european democracy ?
this reading is reinforced by the experience of macron himself .
having never held elected office , macron created a new party centered on himself , with support from both center-left and center-right voters .
he seems to have restructured french politics in the process .
next year ’s european parliament election is likely to reveal more about the potential for such political restructuring .
washington , dc – in december 2014 , the cover of time magazine ’s “ person of the year ” issue featured salome karwah , a nursing assistant who not only survived the ebola epidemic in her native liberia that year , but also helped waves of patients arriving at her ebola ward .
karwah was a hero who met a tragic end .
one year ago , she died from complications in childbirth , a killer that every month takes twice as many lives as the entire ebola epidemic .
childbirth has been dangerous for women and newborns throughout human history .
in the nineteenth century , as many as one in 100 pregnancies in europe ended with the death of the mother .
the rest of the region wanted to emulate them .
to be sure , refugee labor is a delicate political issue for syria ’s neighbors .
an estimated two million syrians live in turkey , and more than one million live in jordan .
most of them are living outside refugee camps , and many are working – for the most part illegally .
unemployment in turkey and jordan are about 10 % and 12 % , respectively , and their governments are naturally wary of programs that could cost their citizens jobs .
the reasons why president george w. bush chose to go to war in afghanistan and iraq were no doubt complex .
but the language used by those wars ’ neo-conservative promoters came straight from the kennedy era : the spread of democracy , the cause of liberty , and the universal authority of “ american values . ”
one reason why americans elected obama in 2008 was that the rhetoric of us idealism had once again led to the death and displacement of millions .
now when us politicians talk about “ freedom , ” people see bombing campaigns , torture chambers , and the constant threat of lethal drones .
the problem with obama ’s america is rooted in the contradictory nature of his leadership .
president bush ’s recent visit to asia made little news – by design .
but that ’s because bush did n’t begin to address the issue that is looming ever larger in the region : the changing face of security in asia in view of china ’s growing economic and military might .
this summer , for example , china and russia conducted their first-ever grand-scale joint military exercise .
this was followed by russian news reports that china , russia , and india would conduct trilateral military exercises , named “ indira 2005 , ” on the same scale before the end of this year .
in the past , such a combination of countries was almost unthinkable , and these exercises can not be explained away as simple “ one-off ” affairs with little resonance .
emerging-market governments must address critical issues arising from weak coordination within , and between , national and municipal governments on health and health-care policies and programs .
they should consider reforms that include giving city governments the authority , resources , and responsibility that they need to address health and health-care outcomes .
anticipatory city planning , based on realistic demographic forecasts , patient registers , and health-information systems , as well as participation in urban health-knowledge networks , needs to be implemented .
proven systems and reforms should be shared between emerging-market cities , and successful new innovations and ideas should be adapted to local conditions .
this includes new and affordable technologies , such as low-cost mobile telephony for use by community-health workers .
shanghai – tight media control of the unrest in tibet has been followed by what , to some , looks like far more open coverage of the devastating earthquake in sichuan province .
is this a change in china ’s media strategy , or just a short term change in tactics ?
this question stands out in view of chinese public opinion in the latter phase of the tibet crisis .
much to the consternation of the western media , chinese people worldwide lashed out against its allegedly biased coverage of the tibetan riot .
throngs of chinese expatriates and students took to the streets , protesting the prejudice they perceived in western media reports .
as a result , our forebears ’ livers stayed healthy .
meanwhile , our gatherer ancestors ate carbohydrates ( polymers of glucose ) , which was also transported to the liver , via the glycolytic pathway , and broken down for energy .
any excess glucose stimulated the pancreas to release insulin , which transported glucose into peripheral fat tissue , and which also caused the liver to store glucose as glycogen ( liver starch ) .
so their livers also stayed healthy .
and nature did its part by supplying all naturally occurring foodstuffs with either fat or carbohydrate as the energy source , not both .
there are 2.4 million new infections annually and 34 million people living with hiv/aids who require treatment to stay alive .
there is a widespread misperception in the developed world that we have already won the battle against hiv/aids .
in reality , the crisis has merely become less visible .
sub-saharan africa has 10 % of the world ’s population , but is home to 70 % of those living with hiv/aids .
across africa , the disease is estimated to have reduced average national growth rates by 2-4 percentage points a year .
leaving the single market would cause grave uncertainty for the british economy , especially its financial sector .
even the us has said that it would be unwilling to negotiate a separate free-trade deal with the uk .
remaining in the single market , however , comes at a cost – one that british voters may not support .
the uk would have to adopt the sort of satellite status that norway , iceland , and liechtenstein now have , accepting and implementing decisions that it takes no part in shaping .
if that democratic deficit is unacceptable to the uk , it will be left alone , out in the economic cold .
as the curtain drops , two developments will greatly influence the withdrawal process and the ultimate outcome .
the first is the management of the transition to afghan control , which depends on an orderly withdrawal of american and nato forces by 2014 .
the second is the election , also to be held in 2014 , of a new afghan president – a process that needs to permit the united states and its nato allies to claim plausibly that they are handing the country over to a legitimate government .
for afghanistan , ravaged by war without respite since the “ saur revolution ” of 1978 , the endgame will be even more nerve-wracking .
as the us military leaves , it will enter another period of political and strategic uncertainty , after almost a half-century of disorder and civil war .
new york – watching a sophisticated democratic society knowingly walk into a predictable and avoidable national disaster is a rare and alarming experience .
most british politicians are well aware that leaving the european union with no agreement on the post-brexit relationship will cause enormous damage to their country .
they are not sleepwalking into the abyss ; their eyes are wide open .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
and that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to us interests elsewhere in the world .
this is no longer an option .
in fact , even if the us were not attempting to normalize relations , russia ’s current economic woes probably would have doomed its long-standing – and already much-reduced – support for the castro government .
normalization of relations with the us is key to liberalization in cuba .
after all , such changes are best served not by imposing stifling sanctions , or through military “ shock and awe ” tactics , as in iraq , but by socioeconomic improvement and diplomatic engagement by external powers .
indeed , predictions that cuba might now shift toward a chinese-style model of political autocracy and economic opening might be accurate only in the short term .
in recent years , much political activity has been directly or indirectly focused on exchange rates in ways that imply new economic and political divisions .
although countries have not descended fully into protectionism since the global financial crisis began , difficult economic and labor-market conditions in key countries may force politicians to protect domestic markets while trying to gain external competitiveness .
but , while vigilance is in order , the chance that major countries will embrace competitive devaluations – initiating genuine currency wars in the process – is slim .
it is well known that weidmann does not like it when central banks , especially the european central bank , buy sovereign bonds .
but claiming that unconventional monetary-policy measures would carry the risk of “ much stronger politicizing of exchange rates ” misses the mark .
the census bureau projects that the american population will grow 49 % over the next four decades .
today the us is the world ’s third most populous country ; 50 years from now it is still likely to be third ( after only china and india ) .
not only is immigration relevant to economic power , but , given that nearly all developed countries are aging and face a burden of providing for older generations , it could help reduce the sharpness of the policy problem .
in addition , even though studies suggest that the short-term , directly measurable economic benefits at the national level are relatively small , and unskilled workers may suffer from competition , skilled immigrants can be important to particular economic sectors .
a 1 % increase in the number of immigrant college graduates leads to a 6 % increase in patents per capita .
in fact , only two of the six major economic tasks identified by the work conference fit neatly with the third plenum ’s strategic agenda .
the call for enhanced social security is consistent with the third plenum ’s proposal to allocate 30 % of state-owned enterprises ’ profits to fund safety-net programs such as pensions and health care .
likewise , the emphasis on markets ’ “ decisive role ” in upgrading china ’s industrial structure and eliminating excess capacity is compatible with the third plenum ’s goal of achieving a market-based shift to a consumer society .
but what emerges from all of this is yet another example of the timeworn “ kitchen sink ” approach to chinese economic policymaking – countless proposals , initiatives , and goals that are loosely connected at best , and that are often plagued by internal inconsistencies .
a new approach is needed , and it will require three key changes to china ’s economic-policy framework .
the essential economic reality confronting the ecb today is that the american economy is falling headlong into a serious slump – bernanke ’s surprise cut speaks volumes to this .
it defies economic logic to think that the global economy – including europe – will escape its consequences .
as european growth slows , so will inflationary pressures .
so trichet should relax , stop threatening others , and let the economic slowdown do the work for him .
even with sticky wages and prices in europe , the global slowdown will reduce energy , commodity , and food prices on world markets , all of which are important factors behind currently elevated european inflation levels .
all major players in russia ’s energy-centric economy quickly fell into line politically , enabling putin to use the country ’s oil and gas exports as a geopolitical cudgel .
eu countries that he could not intimidate militarily , owing to nato , were wooed with discounts – or punished with price hikes .
hungarian prime minister victor orbán is putin ’s staunchest friend in europe ( though greek prime minister alexis tsipras seems to want to change that ) , while poland ’s leaders have consistently warned that russia could become a menace to the continent again .
as a result , whereas hungary pays gazprom $ 260 per thousand cubic meters of gas , poland pays $ 526 – the highest price in the eu .
the poles have paid a steep price , but they were right .
but , though accusations of biopiracy may have emotional appeal , impartial analyses have shown that they have little factual basis .
in fact , biopiracy is rare – so rare that it can be dealt with directly .
instead , the world created a baroque , bureaucratic , politicized system that systematically inhibits scientific research , plant breeding , and the creation of intellectual property .
the seed treaty achieves this by establishing a multilateral system for access to a negotiated list of agricultural genetic resources .
the seed treaty also brought under the control of its parties and secretariat the 15 research institutions that comprise the consultative group of international agricultural research ( cgiar ) , an influential global research partnership .
he has also reduced the resources channeled to certain religious institutions , helped those in his circle to establish private banks by easing regulations , and challenged iran ’s most powerful economic and military institution , the islamic revolutionary guards corps ( irgc ) .
but , as the rift between khamenei and ahmadinejad has grown , support for the president has declined significantly , with even state-run media referring to ahmadinejad ’s loyalists as a “ deviation circle . ”
moreover , unlike during ahmadinejad ’s first term , non-state media now publicly criticize his economic and political agenda .
with the end of ahmadinejad ’s second and final term fast approaching , it seems unlikely that the disgraced , unpopular president will abandon his efforts to destabilize iran ’s ruling establishment .
in fact , he had long promoted mashai as his successor , but khamenei curtailed his illegal efforts – and has now put a stop to mashai ’s candidacy altogether .
under monti ’s leadership , reforms were finally initiated and markets were calmed .
to enhance the credibility of public finances , monti ’s government substantially increased taxes , particularly on real estate , while preserving the already record-high income-tax rate .
the tax plan highlighted that italy , like japan , is a country of public debt and private wealth .
as the economist marco fortis points out , italian family wealth is still , if not for long , second to none in europe .
beyond growing international credibility , two major changes to the italian political landscape have shaped the election campaign .
one of the hardest lessons for senior government officials to learn – ­ including for me , when i was australian attorney general and foreign minister – is the futility , in all but a tiny minority of cases , of trying to prosecute and punish those responsible for leaks .
it does n’t undo the original damage , and usually compounds it with further publicity .
the media are never more enthusiastic about free speech than when they see it reddening the faces , with rage or humiliation , of those in power .
prosecution usually boosts leakers ’ stature , making it useless as a deterrent .
but some lines do have to be drawn if good government is to be possible , just as a zone of privacy in our personal and family lives is crucial to sustaining the relationships that matter most to us .
clearly , there is no form of brexit – or post-brexit britain – that will satisfy both groups .
this explains may ’s desperation to push brexit through as quickly as possible .
she wants to get out before voters realize that the leave campaign sold them a false bill of goods , including the promise that they could keep all of the benefits of eu membership , particularly full access to the european single market , without having to allow free movement of labor .
moreover , although may was in the “ remain ” camp during the referendum campaign , she realizes that , as prime minister , she will be held responsible for any failures in the brexit negotiations .
she also knows that she can not possibly succeed politically , because the media will always spotlight “ defeats , ” while hardly noticing “ wins . ”
among other things , such surveys should aim to create a clear picture of adolescents ’ exposure to avoidable risk factors , such as alcohol and illicit drug use , unsafe sexual behaviors , violence , obesity , physical inactivity , and unhealthy diet .
to complement this effort , we must also invest in improving our understanding of how these risk factors – most often studied in connection with early childhood and adulthood – affect adolescents ’ health .
according to the global burden of disease study , health risk factors explain at least 50 % of the early death and disability of adults aged 50 and over ; for young people , the figure drops to 26 % .
more studies are needed to inform health policy and planning adequately .
the data-collection effort should also include a focus on mental health .
pakistan these days is a troubled country , politically as well as economically .
but talk of regime change may have prompted musharraf to re-enter politics .
only a politician who has the support of major constituencies can hope to restore political order and economic health , and musharraf is presenting himself as a candidate whom the military might support .
thus , in a long interview with the bbc before launching his new party , musharraf suggested that pakistan ’s army was the only institution that could save the country from its current woes .
“ there is a sense of despondency in pakistan , and the place that the people go to is the military , ” he said .
with politicians effectively rewarded for myopic thinking , the western democracies find themselves struggling to secure stable long-term growth in a way that , say , authoritarian china is not .
there are at least two ways to address this problem in a democratic context .
first , governments could be bound more firmly to their predecessors ’ policy decisions .
that way , more forward-thinking legislation that has been debated and enacted will have time actually to take effect , without the risk that it will simply be repealed by a subsequent administration .
the european union provides one example of how long-term binding commitments can work .
this begins with political will and the setting of priorities .
at the wef in incheon , nobel peace prize laureate kailash satyarthi called for a mass popular movement demanding that education be placed prominently on the agenda of every politician running for election , at all levels of government .
for the sdgs to be operational , education has to receive higher billing , nationally and globally .
the incheon declaration calls for the allocation of at least 15-20 % of total public expenditure to education .
moreover , the ongoing decline in aid to education must be reversed , and new financial sources – such as emerging-economy donors , the private sector , foundations , and philanthropists – must be mobilized .
ukraine ’s current refinance rate is 16 % a year , 10 % less than inflation , which means that ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10 % a year .
as a result , ukraine ’s money supply , m3 , exploded by no less than 52 % in the last year , which points to inflation hitting 30 % soon .
the nbu ’s leadership understands that it must act to contain inflation , but its insistence on the dollar peg ties their hands , because it prevents them from raising interest rates sufficiently .
instead , they have reverted to strict reserve requirements , effectively rationing credit and thereby causing a domestic credit squeeze in the midst of the current international financial crisis , which is likely to force some medium-sized banks into bankruptcy because of liquidity problems .
rationing is always worse than a market .
the first concerns iranian domestic politics and the ongoing power struggle within the regime – & a struggle that scuttled a diplomatic solution once before , because neither conservatives nor reformers were willing to afford president mahmoud ahmadinejad a diplomatic triumph .
one can only hope that , in view of the seriousness of the situation , this route to failure will be closed off .
developments in syria , iran ’s last remaining ally in the region , are equally likely to play a role .
the fall of president bashar al-assad ’s regime would amount to a strategic debacle for iran , which would then be faced by a united front of arab states , supported by turkey , the us , and , in a way , by israel .
iran would then find it difficult to maintain its foothold in lebanon , and its position would become more complicated even in iraq , despite its shia majority .
the eu ’s approach to sharing power , hammering out agreements , and resolving conflict by multiple committees can be frustrating and lacks drama , but it is increasingly relevant for many issues in a networked and interdependent world .
as mark leonard , director of the european council on foreign relations , has put it , “ the conventional wisdom is that europe ’s hour has come and gone .
its lack of vision , divisions , obsession with legal frameworks , unwillingness to project military power , and sclerotic economy are contrasted with a united states more dominant even than rome … but the problem is not europe – it is our outdated understanding of power . ”
the american political scientist andrew moravcsik makes the similar argument that european nations , singly and collectively , are the only states other than the us that are able to “ exert global influence across the full spectrum from ‘ hard ’ to ‘ soft ’ power .
insofar as the term retains any meaning , the world is bipolar , and is likely to remain so over the foreseeable future . ”
tehran – iranians will go to the polls on june 12 to elect a new president .
while some argue that president mahmoud ahmadinejad ’s re-election is a foregone conclusion , the outcome is , in fact , not at all clear .
iran ’s supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , has repeatedly said in public settings that he will not declare his preference among the candidates .
indeed , in mashad on march 21 , ayatollah khamenei said , “ there were some rumors that i support a special candidate for the presidential elections .
but i have one vote , and i would not determine a certain candidate because the people themselves should choose their candidates based on their own knowledge . ”
but this will be offset by limits on personal tax deductions and exclusions , and the lower tax rates on personal income will boost taxable incomes as individuals increase earnings and compensation shifts from fringe benefits to taxable cash .
likewise , the move to a territorial tax system will raise taxable profits , especially in the short term , as companies repatriate some of the existing stock of overseas funds .
although the net tax changes may widen the budget deficit in the short term , the incentive effects of lower tax rates and the increased accumulation of capital will mean faster economic growth and higher real incomes , both of which will cause rising taxable incomes and lower long-term deficits .
there is an important legislative reason why the projected budget will return to surplus in the future .
the republicans have only a very small majority in the senate , where the filibuster rule requires a three-fifths majority to pass most legislation , giving the democrats the ability to block the republican tax agenda .
the eu must also revitalize its operation sophia initiative to combat refugee smuggling in the mediterranean .
second , europe needs to handle economic migrants and asylum-seekers separately .
combining them has brought its asylum system close to collapse ; separating them would help to ensure that those in fear for their lives can be given a fair hearing in which their rights are protected .
addressing genuine economic and social needs in the eu requires an effective blue - or green-card policy for economic migrants , with an overall immigration target .
and policymakers must not wait until the next migration crisis before introducing the scheme .
will the fed ’s gradual reduction of qe bring with it more emerging-market problems this year ?
to what extent are today ’s conditions comparable to those that triggered the asian crisis of 1997 or other abrupt capital-flow reversals in recent decades ?
emerging-market bulls point out that most major middle-income countries have substantially lowered their public debt/gdp ratios , giving them fiscal space that they lacked in the past .
but neither the mexican “ tequila crisis ” of 1994 nor the asian crisis of 1997 was caused by large public deficits .
in both cases , the effort to defend a fixed exchange rate in the face of capital-flow reversals was a major factor , as was true in turkey in the year prior to its currency collapse in february 2001 .
already , many people in their fifties and sixties would like to remain economically productive , perhaps working 20-30 hours per week .
at the same time , younger people long for more time for education , leisure , friends , and , crucially , children .
both desires can be fulfilled if societies allow older people to work more years and let everyone work fewer hours .
one option is to move toward an average workweek of 25 hours and an average working life that extends up to age 70 – and to even higher ages if healthy life expectancy continues to rise .
such a reform could be implemented over several decades without slowing economic growth or reducing prosperity .
it is that commitment by which the government is now bound .
“ bouncing ” britain in is simply impossible .
british public opinion is now so hostile , to the eu in general and to the euro in particular , that a referendum could not be won without a massive government campaign of persuasion .
denmark ’s government has done just this and seems to be bringing the danish public around to the idea of joining the euro .
prime minister tony blair is apparently convinced of the strategic desirability of joining the euro , but because a yes vote in a referendum now looks so implausible he is unlikely to try .
the middle of the range of scenarios considered by the intergovernmental panel on climate change projects that atmospheric co2 concentrations will reach nearly three times their pre-industrial level in 2100 .
while the bush administration remains skeptical about the science behind such projections , some state and local governments are enacting measures to cut co2 emissions .
more importantly , companies such as general electric are committing to green goals that go well beyond government regulations .
a recent report by the bipartisan national commission on energy policy exemplifies the new coalition .
while president bush argues that technological advances in hydrogen fuels and fuel cells will curb oil imports in the long run , such measures require major changes in transportation infrastructure that will require decades to complete .
people in these fields are ultimately bought and sold by corporate managers as much as people in technical fields .
hardly anyone makes it all the way to the top in the business world .
the important point for students to bear in mind is that they should motivate themselves to attain deep understanding , not rote memorization , of the subjects that they study , in order to fulfill the role of a true expert in whatever field they ultimately choose to pursue .
at the same time , they should invest in acquiring the communications skills that will be similarly crucial to a successful career .
achieving this kind of education probably means pursuing what one naturally finds interesting and engaging , whether that is finance or physiology .
but this day is also about spreading a message on behalf of elizabeth and other women like her : abortion , while in many countries a political wedge issue , is simply a fact of life .
each year , 25 % of all pregnancies – about 56 million – are terminated .
abortions occur in every country and within every socioeconomic class .
in the united states , 61 % of abortion patients are in their 20s , 59 % are already mothers , and nearly two-thirds identify with an organized religion .
but abortion is most common in developing countries , where access to family-planning services is often limited .
the ecb should not delude itself into thinking that a small increase in interest rates will be enough .
if and when wage pressure comes , the ecb , to remain true to its word , may be forced to increase interest rates much more than it now expects .
the second argument is that if the ecb stands firm , workers will not demand higher nominal wages , for they will understand that this would only lead to higher interest rates and higher unemployment .
this argument is not irrelevant ; monetary policy probably has some effect on wage bargaining .
but one should not expect too much from a tough ecb stance .
megaupload allowed its 180 million registered users to upload and download movies , television shows , and music , and some of the money earned by dotcom ( from advertising and subscriptions ) was on display at his mansion near auckland , where he kept his rolls-royce and other exotic cars .
dotcom ’s lawyer claims that megaupload was merely providing storage for its subscribers ’ files , and had no control over what they were storing .
but megaupload offered cash rewards to users who uploaded files that proved popular with other users .
last month , the united states considered legislation that aimed at stopping internet piracy .
the bills had been written at the urging of hollywood studios and the publishing and recording industries , which claim that violations of copyright on the internet cost the us 100,000 jobs .
moscow – when the opening ceremony of the beijing olympic games begins in a few days , viewers will be presented with a minutely choreographed spectacle swathed in nationalist kitsch .
of course , images that recall hitler ’s goose-stepping storm troopers are the last thing that china ’s leaders have in mind for their olympics ; after all , official chinese nationalism proclaims the country ’s “ peaceful rise ” within an idyll of “ harmonious development . ”
but , both aesthetically and politically , the parallel is hardly far-fetched .
indeed , by choosing albert speer jr. , the son of hitler ’s favorite architect and the designer of the 1936 berlin olympics , to design the master plan for the beijing games , china ’s government has itself alluded to the radical politicization of aesthetics that was a hallmark of twentieth-century totalitarianism .
like those regimes , whether fascist or communist , china ’s leaders have sought to transform public space and sporting events into visible proof of their fitness and mandate to rule .
if anything , economists ’ embrace of that role has grown stronger since then .
but it has also made the subject less relevant and reduced its legitimacy and credibility .
economists are no longer seen by much of the public to be asking the right questions or seeking to answer them with integrity .
to recover credibility , economics needs to become more open to criticism of assumptions , methods , and results .
the inconvenient truths spoken by dissenting voices can not be ignored indefinitely .
the united states is reckoning with a psychologically unstable president , a plutocratic cabinet , and a republican congressional majority .
europe is in the throes of multiple economic , social , political , and institutional crises .
china , by contrast , is dynamic and outward-looking – providing good reason for the eu to assume vigorous leadership and engage in constructive partnerships with china on key initiatives ( such as sustainable infrastructure across eurasia ) .
in short , this is a critical time for germany and europe to provide vision , stability , and global leadership .
and that imperative extends to chancellor angela merkel ’s christian democratic union ( cdu ) , its bavarian sister party , the christian social union ( csu ) , and the spd .
in keeping with china ’s recent efforts to project its “ soft ” side , the opening ceremony produced the idea of a historic , but dynamic culture at its best .
other than the presence of a few people ’s liberation army soldiers , you would have been hard pressed to find any visible evidence of the reigning communist regime or its founder , mao zedong .
equally significant was the projection of china as a nascent leader of the new international cultural order .
the “ bird ’s nest ” stadium was the creation of the multinational design team of herzog & de meuron , with suggestions from the visual artist ai weiwei .
many artists involved in the creation of the spectacle , including the fireworks specialist cai guo qiang , the dance star shen wei , and the composer tan dun , earned their fame primarily in the west .
my research , which has included thousands of interviews with women from india to burkina faso , has centered on one question : how can the international community improve the welfare of the world ’s poorest women ?
the answer , it turns out , is to help them do what they are already doing on their own .
one of the most effective ways to empower women anywhere , but especially in the developing world , is by promoting financial independence .
in many areas , that means supporting “ informal savings groups , ” networks of like-minded women who pay dues to build a shared pool of resources .
this money can then be drawn on to fund any number of items , such as small business expenses , school fees , or health-care costs .
so the summit ’s outcome was far from a miracle .
what really mattered in heiligendamm were not the decisions taken by any putative world government but the fact that the days of the g8 now seem to be numbered .
politically and economically , china and india are more important today than some european g8 members .
indeed , europeans should understand that this viewpoint is spreading around the world , particularly on the other side of the atlantic .
president putin ’s behavior at the summit clearly demonstrated what he thinks about the europeans ; not too much .
african leaders are right to be concerned .
though the eu claims that the epas will buttress the afcfta , preliminary research indicates that the trade gains brought by the epas , as negotiated , are likely to be concentrated on a few agricultural products – and to exclude the least-developed countries .
in most areas , the epas will actually hurt intra-african trade , weakening trade revenues and undermining trade-driven industrialization in africa .
some argue that the problem is more about timing , because the losses are likely to materialize immediately , and the possible benefits brought by increased access to the eu market will take longer to emerge .
given this , epa proponents argue , a special fund should be established to compensate for some of the short-term losses .
for example , in 1995 the smithsonian institution in washington sought to take a fresh look at the enola gay , the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima .
john dower , an american historian and specialist of modern japan , studied the issue at length .
he demonstrated how history can be presented and valued in totally different ways : from an american or japanese point of view , even though no one is making up facts or falsifying sources .
selection and combination of data is enough .
for the americans , there was `` a heroic or triumphant account in which atomic bombs represent the final blow against an aggressive , fanatic , and savage enemy . ''
it would have to be cobbled together at the october 17 meeting of the european council , where european leaders are growing increasingly frustrated with the entire process .
moreover , johnson has already disbanded the civil-service team that led the previous negotiations .
any new agreement will be may ’s old deal with a few bells and whistles .
it will push the real issues down the road rather than ending the brexit debate .
that show has years to run .
likewise , our inability to come together to stop syrian president bashar al-assad ’s war crimes against his own people has left a void that putin and iran have filled .
european leaders too often shout from the sidelines when they should be on the field , acting to defend common european interests .
and as if our failure to ensure stability in our own neighborhood was not enough , we have also allowed right-wing populist and nationalist movements to take off within the european union itself .
these movements , actively fomented by russia , have produced homegrown political leaders who frighteningly – but not surprisingly – resemble putin and erdoğan .
poland ’s de facto leader , jarosław kaczyński , and hungarian prime minister viktor orbán , in particular , have been busily constructing illiberal states within the eu .
a common framework must also be created so that such programs can be scaled up and implemented in different contexts .
for example , delivering benefit “ points , ” rather than money denominated in a particular currency , would allow schemes to operate across borders at a time when workers increasingly need to do the same .
and standardized educational credentials would retain their value as they moved with those who have earned them .
as the nature of work changes , so must the nature of benefit systems .
to deliver opportunities and security to everyone , everywhere at a time of widespread technological disruption , governments and private-sector actors must work together to advance innovative solutions that meet the urgent and evolving needs of workers .
moreover , even without a timely correction , brazil will respond to crisis in a far different way to mexico .
rightly or wrongly , mexican policymakers were in awe of wall street ; brazil has no such hang up .
ultimately , brazilian policymakers are concerned with their own well being , not with the prosperity of foreign investors .
if and when the two part , brazilian policymakers will shed few tears for international investors .
on the surface and below , brazil has made a dramatic turn : inflation is down to negligible levels .
by incorporating carbon-reducing strategies into agriculture and land conservation , more heat-trapping gases can be locked up in forests and soils .
but while the techniques already exist , success will require increasing the use of no-till farming , adopting permaculture principles , better managing wetlands , and using rotational grazing techniques , among other measures .
the power of markets to drive radical changes in energy and land use is great , but as the storm season of 2017 should remind us , the climate emergency we face requires vigorous and urgent action .
transforming the way people acquire and consume energy , and use land , will require strong incentives and policy frameworks to set the course for success .
but do n’t despair : there is still time to save our climate .
many democratic candidates have called for a major expansion of government-funded health care .
but their proposals – a single-payer system ( “ medicare for all ” ) , a national health service , or something else – do not all mean the same thing .
several contenders – including bernie sanders , elizabeth warren , kamala harris , and beto o’rourke – do not entirely agree on the details of such schemes , or simply have not spelled them out .
but after former president barack obama attempted to fix the american health-care disaster with halfway measures – arguably the most that was politically feasible at the time – those vying for the democratic nomination clearly have more ambitious plans .
warren , meanwhile , has proposed the introduction of universal childcare , to be financed by a wealth tax on fortunes above $ 50 million .
but there is another explanation , one that is fully consistent with rationality and self-interest .
when mainstream politicians lose their credibility , it is natural for voters to discount the promises they make .
voters are more likely to be attracted to candidates who have anti-establishment credentials and can safely be expected to depart from prevailing policies .
in the language of economists , centrist politicians face a problem of asymmetric information .
they claim to be reformers , but why should voters believe leaders who appear no different from the previous crop of politicians who oversold them the gains from globalization and pooh-poohed their grievances ?
today , leaders in rwanda , which is widely considered an african success story , have improved stability by moving away from the washington consensus approach to governance .
politically , rwanda is strong , disciplined , and organized , but it is not liberal .
the landslide reelection of president paul kagame last year had more to do with power than democracy .
although kagame remains popular , his government was criticized for stifling free speech and human rights in the run-up to the vote .
the conclusion i draw is not that human rights do n’t matter , but that political discipline and imperfect forms of democracy are acceptable if the tradeoff is sustained progress in economic and institutional governance .
the cross-border flows of goods , information , people , and capital that are its lifeblood rely on a threshold level of safety , stability , and predictability .
it is this threshold that appears to be under threat .
continued economic progress in the developing world and recovery in the developed countries requires preventing local and regional conflict from delivering large systemic shocks .
in terms of priorities , it is arguably more important for g-20 governments to strengthen the core systems that enable global flows than it is to address strictly economic issues .
moreover , there is a clear , shared interest in doing so : no one benefits from the expansion of systemic risk .
washington , dc – participants in the occupy wall street movement are right to argue that the big banks have never properly been investigated for the mortgage origination , aggregation , and securitization behavior that was central to the financial crisis – and to the loss of more than eight million jobs .
but , thanks to the efforts of new york ’s attorney general , eric schneiderman , and others , serious discussion has started in the united states about an out-of court mortgage settlement between state attorney generals and prominent financial-sector firms .
talks among state officials , the obama administration , and the banks are currently focused on reported abuses in servicing mortgages , foreclosing on homes , and evicting their residents .
but leading banks are also accused of illegal behavior – inducing people to borrow , for example , by deceiving them about the interest rate that would actually be paid , while misrepresenting the resulting mortgage-backed securities to investors .
if these charges are true , the bank executives involved may fear that civil lawsuits would uncover evidence that could be used in criminal prosecutions .
“ over the rivers and down the highways and along countless jungle paths , the population of east pakistan continues to hemorrhage into india : an endless unorganized flow of refugees with a few tin kettles , cardboard boxes , and ragged clothes piled on their heads , carrying their sick children and their old .
they pad along barefooted , with the mud sucking at their heels in the wet parts .
they are silent , except for a child whimpering now and then , but their faces tell the story .
many are sick and covered with sores .
others have cholera , and when they die by the roadside there is no one to bury them . ”
charges of currency manipulation and threats of protectionist measures have intensified .
with the uk , which gave the world free trade in the 1840s , having now decided to go it alone , the old atlantic charter allies are putting national sovereignty ahead of global public goods .
now the global spotlight turns to france and its looming presidential election .
at stake is the sputtering franco-german engine that has driven european integration and kept it at the center of the post-war multilateral system .
a victory for le pen in early may would spell the end of the eu , leaving german chancellor angela merkel as the final pillar of a crumbling world order .
new york – when i was a bright-eyed eighth grader in my native sri lanka , i could n’t wait for my first sex education class .
in our early teens , my classmates and i were as curious as we were clueless about sex and sexuality .
yet , instead of receiving reliable answers to pressing questions about our bodies , relationships , and sexuality , we were simply handed a book , told to read a particular chapter , and left to figure things out on our own .
millions of young people around the world have similar experiences , often with serious adverse consequences .
following its targeted killing of iran 's second most powerful leader , the us could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the middle east , a path that could lead to additional iranian provocations .
after all , iran and the us have already been at war for decades , and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now .
as in previous years , project syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months .
if there is one common theme in this year 's selection , it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come .
regardless of how facebook ’s own digital-currency moonshot , libra , fares , it has already provided a wake-up call for firms and policymakers around the world .
“ if revolution there is to be , let us rather undertake it than undergo it , ” otto von bismarck once said .
four decades after the “ nixon shock , ” no one disputes that china has benefited enormously today , the impoverished and autarkic country that nixon visited is history .
global reintegration has turned china into an economic powerhouse .
it is the world ’s largest exporter in volume terms , and is the world ’s second-largest economy .
china ’s presence is felt around the world , from mines in africa to apple stores in the united states .
as we reflect on china ’s remarkable progress since 1972 , it is also an opportune time to consider how china continues to fall short in overcoming systemic obstacles to long-term success .
a significant chinese slowdown may already be unfolding .
us president donald trump ’s trade war has shaken confidence , but this is only a downward shove to an economy that was already slowing as it makes the transition from export - and investment-led growth to more sustainable domestic consumption-led growth .
how much the chinese economy will slow is an open question ; but , given the inherent contradiction between an ever-more centralized party-led political system and the need for a more decentralized consumer-led economic system , long-term growth could fall quite dramatically .
unfortunately , the option of avoiding the transition to consumer-led growth and continuing to promote exports and real-estate investment is not very attractive , either .
china is already a dominant global exporter , and there is neither market space nor political tolerance to allow it to maintain its previous pace of export expansion .
the arab world faces serious problems that can only be met by more flexible , democratic political systems .
the second arab human development report , issued in 2003 , underscores the close relationship between the arab world 's educational shortcomings and its lack of democracy .
democracy requires an informed citizenry able to question its government .
a well-educated citizenry is also essential if young men and women are to acquire the skills needed to perform the sort of jobs today 's global and competitive world demands .
alas , instead of progress , what we see is a cycle of inadequate educational opportunity leading to a lack of economic opportunity .
the president has threatened to destroy turkey ’s economy if it does what he enabled it to do .
with kurds – most of them civilians – fleeing turkish bombs , the un security council has remained typically silent , while the europeans have condemned everything and everyone involved .
as foreign-policy disasters go , this is one for the record books .
but the seeds for this larger conflagration were sown long before the now-infamous trump-erdoğan call .
absent any coherent policy , the conditions were ripe for a crisis .
but a helicopter-money program – a fanciful idea when milton friedman proposed it in 1969 – would also be a radical departure for policymakers , requiring an abundance of caution about citizen and investor perception , confidence , and solid governance structures .
and such an approach would cement the notion that central bank policy is “ the only game in town , ” relieving elected government leaders of their responsibility for pro-growth policies and the fiscal decisions they control .
a less risky and time-tested route for stimulating demand would be a significant increase in public infrastructure investment funded by government debt .
it is well documented that europe and the united states have underinvested in infrastructure .
from a macroeconomic perspective , infrastructure investment is a “ twofer ” – it strengthens productivity and competitiveness in the long run and , where there is unused capacity , it boosts demand , output , and employment with significant multiplier effects in the short run .
with the government losing $ 4.5 billion every year by subsidizing passenger fares , it has little money to spend on upgrading infrastructure , improving safety standards , or speeding up the trains .
as a result , the railways run out of money before running out of plans .
in the last 30 years , only 317 of 676 projects sanctioned by parliament have been completed , and it is difficult to imagine how the railways will acquire the estimated $ 30 billion needed to complete the remaining 359 projects .
and if all of this were not bad enough , india 's leadership seems not to recognize the challenges that the railways present .
in a country where rail passengers can not even expect a clean toilet , let alone an on-time arrival , prime minister narendra modi has spoken of introducing bullet trains – the latest in a string of irrationally grandiose aspirations .
under federalism – whether cooperative or “ uncooperative ” – it is often assumed that state and local governments are pursuing the same goals .
in fact , there is a deep divide between left-leaning “ blue ” cities and the right-leaning “ red ” states where many are located .
and there are many ways that state governments can thwart progressive federalism at the municipal level .
cities , for their part , often lack the information and resources necessary for developing and implementing effective policies .
a number of organizations have now emerged to strengthen the policy-making capacity of city governments including michael bloomberg ’s government innovation program , fuse corps , results for america , social finance , third sector capital partners , and usafacts .
we need to look beyond these figures to determine who really is responsible for fomenting a political climate where blatant lies and explicit racism and bigotry have entered the mainstream of public discourse .
only when we identify the sources of the odious virus now afflicting our democracies can we take practical steps to quarantine them .
let ’s start with “ patient zero ” in this political plague : rupert murdoch .
for decades , this impresario of the right-wing political-entertainment complex has coarsened politics in the uk and the us – not to mention his native australia – for the sake of profit and political influence .
murdoch ’s newspapers and television networks might as well have patented the recipe for the deceitful , dog-whistle politics that powered trump ’s rise and the brexit vote .
